<p>  Fact-checking? What’s fact-checking?  I found it on the Internet!  </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,63048,00.html">Wired  News has a story on various people and news agencies being fooled by  <i>Onion</i> articles</a>.  This used to be news, but now it’s so common it may end up relegated  to just a counter.  “Number of people fooled by Onion articles: n+1”.  </p>
