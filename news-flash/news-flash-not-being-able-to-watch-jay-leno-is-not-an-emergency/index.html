<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News Flash: Not being able to watch Jay Leno is not an emergency</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Mesa (Arizona) Police Department reminds us in a press release that <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/0727mr-storm0727Z11.html"> 9-1-1 is for emergencies, and the inability to watch Jay Leno due to a power outage does not qualify as an emergency</a>.
 (Noting, because everybody else will, that this is not the same as the unconfirmed of the woman who <a href="http://www.snopes.com/crime/cops/burger.asp"> called 9-1-1 for a cheeseburger emergency</a>.)
