<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">From the research journal Duh: To lose weight, eat less</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Researchers have determined that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2008787292_diet26.html"> the key to losing weight is to consume fewer calories</a>. </p>
<p> Okay, it’s actually more interesting than the summary suggests. The researchers compared a variety of different popular diets and found that it didn’t matter what diet you were on; the weight loss (and regain) was the same. The controlling factor was how many calories you consumed. </p>
