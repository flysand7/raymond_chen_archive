<p> McClatchy Newspapers discovers, to everyone’s surprise, that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008986081_moneytip05.html"> work-at-home job offers are mostly just scams</a>. Of course, this is something <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/workfromhome/workfromhome_s.html"> Rob Cockerham discovered years ago</a>. (He also has <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/workfromhome/workfromhome.html"> a rundown</a> of all his articles on the subject, in case you haven’t gotten enough.)</p>
