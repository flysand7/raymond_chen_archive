<p>“We try to make them as healthy as possible,” <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/stage/cl-et-transfat12mar12,0,145908.story"> says Jose Mier</a>. As healthy as <a href="http://www.capitalchurros.com/churros.html"> sixteen inches of deep-fried dough</a>, covered in sugar, and stuffed with caramel can be. That is to say, not healthy at all.
 Here are some ideas for making them healthier: Don’t coat them in sugar, don’t stuff them with Bavarian cream, and don’t deep-fry them. Or just get over the fact that churros aren’t healthy and stop pretending that they are.
