<p> Every so often, I’ll run across a statement of the obvious disguised as news and post it to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/News%20Flash/default.aspx"> News flash</a> tag, but the ones I’ve found have nothing on this collection of the <a href="http://www.11points.com/News-Politics/11_Most_Painfully_Obvious_Newspaper_Articles_Ever"> 11 Most Painfully Obvious Newspaper Articles Ever</a>. Just click through and slap your forehead. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus News Flash</b>: <a href="http://espn.go.com/sportsnation/post/_/id/4816732"> <i>Mark McGwire used steroids</i></a>. I can’t wait to see what other breaking news stories we’ll have in the coming days. “Pope’s religion identified.” “Bear feces found in forest.” </p>
