<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News flash: Professional athletes do it for the money</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This weekend is <a href="http://www.nba.com/allstar2007/"> NBA All-Star Weekend 2007</a>, because just having a game isn’t enough; you need to make it a weekend-long festival.
 Tyrus Thomas, invited to paricipate in the slam dunk contest, which comes with a top prize of $35,000, was quoted as saying</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I’m just going to go out there, get my check and call it a day. … I’m just into the free money. That’s it. I’ll just do whatever when I get out there. </p></blockquote>
<p> And yet, there was a huge uproar over the shocking revelation that (news flash!) professional athletes are in it for the money. Thomas was fined $10,000 by his team for his remarks—rather ironic that the way to teach him that it’s not about the money is to impose a monetary penalty—and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2756552"> issued an apology some days later</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I truly feel honored to be invited to participate in this year’s slam dunk contest during next week’s NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas. The opportunity to represent the Bulls and the city of Chicago on a global stage is a privilege that I do not take lightly. I regret the extent to which my comments indicate otherwise. </p></blockquote>
<p> He explained that “it was a miscommunication and understanding of words.” Huh? Under what possible rules of interpretation was “I’m just into the free money” intended to be understood as “The opportunity to appear on a global stage is a privilege that I do not take lightly”?</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/"><i>Only a Game</i></a>‘s Bill Littlefield <a href="http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/330/510052/7258950/WBUR_7258950.mp3"> took up the matter in his Weekly Warm-up podcast</a>. </p>
