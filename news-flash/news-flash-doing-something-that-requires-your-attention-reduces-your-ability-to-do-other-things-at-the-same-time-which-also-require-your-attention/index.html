<p> The <i>New York Times</i> points out that if you engage in an activity that requires your attention, then it reduces your ability to do other things at the same time which also require your attention. For some reason, however this is news when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/us/20messaging.html"> one of those things is sending text messages</a>. </p>
<p> I wonder if, had contemporary news editors existed back in the days when books were invented, they would have published big scary articles expounding on the dangers of reading a book while riding a horse or chopping firewood. </p>
