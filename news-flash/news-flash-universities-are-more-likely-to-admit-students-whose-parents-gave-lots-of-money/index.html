<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News flash: Universities are more likely to admit students whose parents gave lots of money</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Earlier, we saw that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/23/8417522.aspx"> alumni give money to universities in order to increase the likelihood that the university will admit their children</a>. Today, we learn that the tactic works. <a href="http://www.02138mag.com/magazine/article/826.html"> The children of big-donor alumni are more likely to be accepted</a>. In fact, you don’t even have to be the child of alumni. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/golden2.htm"> Just make sure you parents give lots of money</a>.</p>
