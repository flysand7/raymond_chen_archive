<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News Flash: Big houses also cost more to cool</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Perhaps as a counterpart to the fact that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/11/662326.aspx"> big houses have bigger heating bills</a>, NPR yesterday pointed out that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5600118"> bigger houses use more electricity for cooling</a>. (NPR looks not at the “surprise” of big-house owners over the cost of energy, but rather the consequences of these big houses on the energy grid. But the headline was hard to pass up.)</p>
