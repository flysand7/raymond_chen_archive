<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News flash: Everybody has to pay income tax</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://www.stephenjdubner.com/journalism/091802.html"> NFL rookies are required to attend “How not to mess up your life like those other professional athletes” training</a>. They learn about such things as sexual harassment, AIDS, common-law marriage, and, of course, taxes.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Kendrell Bell, a Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker, tells of his great awakening to the verities of income tax: “I got a million-dollar signing bonus. But then I got the check, and it was only $624,000. I thought, Oh, well, I’ll get the other half later. Then I found out that’s all there was. I thought, They can’t do this to me. Then I got on the Internet and I found out they can.” </p></blockquote>
<p> Shocking!  Football players have to pay income tax!  Where will the injustice end?</p>
