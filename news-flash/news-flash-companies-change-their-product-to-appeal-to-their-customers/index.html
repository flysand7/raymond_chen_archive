<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News flash: Companies change their product to appeal to their customers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There was some apparent uproar because there was an industry which “<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008056105_tobacco17.html">changed the flavoring of their product depending on which market segment they were trying to appeal to</a>.”
 Well duh, don’t all industries do this?</p>
<p> The reason why this even remotely qualified as news didn’t appear until the last five words of the article! </p>
