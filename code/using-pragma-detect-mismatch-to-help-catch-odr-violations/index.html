<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Using #pragma detect_mismatch to help catch ODR violations</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of the more insidious problems you may encounter are those traced back to violations of the C++ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Definition_Rule">One Definition Rule</a>. As a general rule, if the conflicting definitions occur in separate translation units, the behavior is undefined, but no diagnostic is required. The lack of a diagnostic means that if two translation units define a type differently (say, because they were compiled with different compile-time configurations), you may not notice a problem until you start dealing with mysterious memory corruption. </p>
<p>These types of bugs are not fun to diagnose. </p>
<p>If you use the Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain, then you can use the <code>#pragma detect_mismatch("name", "value")</code> directive to give the linker some help in identifying mismatched definitions. Specifically, the linker verifies that all such declarations with the same name also have the same value. </p>
<p>The idea here is that if you have something that is declared differently based on compilation settings, you can emit a different <code>#pragma detect_mismatch("name", "value")</code> for each version, using the same name but a different value. The linker will then verify that everybody used the same version of the header file. </p>
<p>Here’s an example: </p>
<pre>
// This is a fake mutex that does no locking.
struct fake_mutex
{
 void lock() {}
 void unlock() {}
};

class Contoso
{
#ifdef SINGLE_THREADED
   // single-threaded doesn't need a mutex.
   typedef fake_mutex mutex_t;
#else
   // multi-threaded needs a true mutex.
   typedef std::mutex mutex_t;
#endif

public:
  Contoso();

  void Activate()
  {
     std::lock_guard&lt;mutex_t&gt; lock(object_mutex);
#ifndef NDEBUG
    isActivated = true;
#endif
    ... business logic to activate the object ...
  }

  void Charge()
  {
     std::lock_guard&lt;mutex_t&gt; lock(object_mutex);
    // You must activate before you can charge.
    assert(!isActivated);
    ... business logic to charge the object ...
  }

private:
  ...
  mutex_t object_mutex;
#ifndef NDEBUG
  bool isActivated = false;
#endif
};
</pre>
<p>If this class is used in a project, but one file in the project is compiled with <code>SINGLE_THREADED</code> and another file is compiled without <code>SINGLE_THREADED</code>, or if the two files disagree on <code>NDEBUG</code>, then you have an ODR violation. In practice, this means that bad things will happen if the two files try to access the same <code>Contoso</code> object. </p>
<p>You can use <code>#pragma detect_mismatch</code> to encode which definition is being used. This allows the linker to detect whether a single project uses multiple conflicting definitions. </p>
<pre>
// This is a fake mutex that does no locking.
struct fake_mutex
{
 void lock() {}
 void unlock() {}
};

class Contoso
{
#ifdef SINGLE_THREADED
   // single-threaded doesn't need a mutex.
   typedef fake_mutex mutex_t;
   <font color="blue">#pragma detect_mismatch("Contoso threading", "Single");</font>
#else
   // multi-threaded needs a true mutex.
   typedef std::mutex mutex_t;
   <font color="blue">#pragma detect_mismatch("Contoso threading", "Multi");</font>
#endif

<font color="blue">#ifdef NDEBUG
   #pragma detect_mismatch("Contoso debug", "Nondebug");
#else
   #pragma detect_mismatch("Contoso debug", "Debug");
#endif</font>

public:
  Contoso();

  void Activate()
  {
     std::lock_guard&lt;mutex_t&gt; lock(object_mutex);
#ifndef NDEBUG
    isActivated = true;
#endif
    ... business logic to activate the object ...
  }

  void Charge()
  {
     std::lock_guard&lt;mutex_t&gt; lock(object_mutex);
    // You must activate before you can charge.
    assert(!isActivated);
    ... business logic to charge the object ...
  }

private:
  ...
  mutex_t object_mutex;
#ifndef NDEBUG
  bool isActivated = false;
#endif
};
</pre>
<p>You can see the directive in action in <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Advanced-STL/C9-Lectures-Stephan-T-Lavavej-Advanced-STL-3-of-n">this Channel 9 video</a> starring C++ library master Stephan T. Lavavej. The <code>detect_mismatch</code> trick appears around timecode 29:30. </p>
<p>Note of course that you can use this technique for things other than catching ODR violations. </p>
