why the <code>SHCOLUMNINFO</code> structure has 1-byte packing</a>.
“Was the expectation that there would be so many columns
in a details view that the saving would be worthwhile?”
</p>
<p>
Hardly anything that clever or ingenious. It’s just the consequence of
a mistake.
</p>
<p>
When the <code>SHCOLUMNINFO</code> structure was added to the
header file in the Windows 2000 timeframe,
it was added with no specific packing directive.
But it turns out that there <i>was</i> a specific packing directive;
it just wasn’t obvious.
Near the top of the <code>shlobj.h</code> header file was the following:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;pshpack1.h&gt;   /* Assume byte packing throughout */
</pre>
<p>
(There was of course a matching <code>#include &lt;poppack.h&gt;</code>
at the bottom.)
This set the default packing for the entire header file to byte
packing instead of natural alignment.
</p>
<p>
By the time this mistake was identified, it was too late.
Windows 2000 had already shipped, byte packing and all.
And once the code ships,
it’s done.
You’re stuck with it.

<p>
Sorry.</p>
