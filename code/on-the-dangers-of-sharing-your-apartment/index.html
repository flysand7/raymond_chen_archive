<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On the dangers of sharing your apartment</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> My colleague <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/marcmill/"> Marc Miller</a> wrote up a brief essay on the subject of dealing with a neutral apartment that has been injected into your single-threaded apartment: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/marcmill/archive/2005/09/29/475465.aspx"> COMmunism: Sharing your Apartment</a>. Highly recommended.</p>
