<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is so special about the instance handle 0x10000000?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know what it means when the <code>Load­Library</code> function returns the special value <code>0x10000000</code>.
 Um, it means that the library was loaded at <code>0x10000000</code>?
 Okay, here’s some more information: “We’re trying to debug an application which loads DLLs and attempts to hook their registry accesses when they call <code>Dll­Register­Server</code>. It looks like when the special handle is returned from <code>Load­Library</code>, the registry writes go through and bypass the hook. On the other hand, when a normal value is returned by <code>Load­Library</code>, the hook works.”
 There is nothing special about the value <code>0x10000000</code>. It’s an address like any other address.
 At this point, your psychic powers might start tingling. Everybody who does Win32 programming should recognize that <code>0x10000000</code> is the default DLL base address assigned by the linker. If you don’t specify a custom base address, the linker will base you at <code>0x10000000</code>.
 Now things are starting to make sense. The DLL being monitored was probably built with the default base address. The value <code>0x10000000</code> is special not because of its numeric value, but because it matches the DLL’s preferred address, which means that no rebasing has occurred. And this in turn suggests that there’s a bug in the registry hooks if the DLL is loaded at its preferred address.
 The code in question was copied from a book, so now they get to debug code copied from a book.
 Wait, we’re not finished yet.
 You may have answered the customer’s question, but you haven’t <i>solved their problem</i>.</p>
<p> Hooking and patching DLLs like this is not supported. But what <i>is</i> supported is the <code>Reg­Override­Predef­Key</code> function. In fact, the <code>Reg­Override­Predef­Key</code> was designed <i>specifically to solve this very problem</i>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The <b>Reg­Override­Predef­Key</b> function is intended for software installation programs. It allows them to remap a predefined key, load a DLL component that will be installed on the system, call an entry point in the DLL, and examine the changes to the registry that the component attempted to make. </p></blockquote>
<p> The documentation continues, explaining how such an installation program might use the <code>Reg­Override­Predef­Key</code> function to accomplish the desired task. </p>
