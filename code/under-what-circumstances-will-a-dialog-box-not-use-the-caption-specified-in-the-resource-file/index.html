<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Under what circumstances will a dialog box not use the caption specified in the resource file?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<blockquote class="q"><p>Under what circumstances will a dialog box not use the caption specified in the resource file? In particular, we have a modal dialog box that is not using the caption from the resource file. Even if we explicitly call <code>Set­Window­Text</code> from within the <code>WM_INIT­DIALOG</code> handler, the call succeeds but the caption remains unchanged. </p></blockquote>
<p>The dialog box’s initial title is the value specified in the resource template. And if you set it again in the <code>WM_INIT­DIALOG</code> handler, then that new title overwrites the title from the resource template. Perhaps the problem is that some other code that runs after your <code>WM_INIT­DIALOG</code> handler is changing the title yet again. </p>

<p>Being skeptical that there could ever be anything else overwriting the code I went to debug with Spy++. After some considerable effort I found out that yes, further down ~30 lines there’s a call to <code>Set­Window­Text</code>  that changes the title to something else. </p>
<p>Thanks for making me look again. </p>
