<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the DLL that refuses to load</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported that they had a problem that occurred
only on some machines but not others.
Their application called
</p>
<pre>
HINSTANCE hinst = LoadLibraryEx(strModule, LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH);
</pre>
<p>
and the call succeeded on some machines, but failed on others
with error
<code>ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND</code>
(“The specified module could not be found”).
The path was a fully-qualified path to a file that
was confirmed to exist and be readable.
</p>
<pre>
strModule = 0x09e875b4 "C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\CopyAndRun\Contoso.dll"
</pre>
<p>
If the <code>sxe ld Contoso.dll</code> command was used in the debugger
to break when the DLL loads,
the breakpoint does fire,
but a breakpoint on Contoso’s <code>Dll­Main</code> is never hit.
“I think this means that the problem is not that Contoso failed
to initialize,
but what <i>does</i> it mean?”
</p>
<p>
If you get a break from <code>sxeld</code> but no breakpoint on
<code>Dll­Main</code>,
then it means that the DLL was found but couldn’t be loaded.
You can use

loader snaps</a>
will
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/junfeng/archive/2006/11/20/debugging-loadlibrary-failures.aspx">
tell you what went wrong</a>.
“My psychic powers tell me that a dependent DLL could not be found
or initialized.”
</p>
<p>
The customer replied,
“Ah, of course. We’ll look into that.”
</p>
<p>
A short while later, they confirmed the diagnosis.
“The Contoso DLL was dependent on a version of the C runtime library
that was not installed on the machines where it failed to load.
But as a follow-up question:
I would have expected that the standard
<i>The program can’t start because XYZ is missing from your computer.</i>
dialog to appear in this case.
Why isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
The reason is there in the error message:
The “missing file” error message is shown only when a program
cannot <i>start</i> due to a missing file.
Specifically, it is raised by the loader only during the initial
DLL resolution phase that occurs as part of process initialization.
These are the DLLs linked implicitly via the module header
because you linked against <code>kernel32.lib</code>, for example.
DLLs loaded explicitly via <code>Load­Library</code> do not
display this error message;
instead, the error is returned back to the program,
where it is expected to take appropriate recovery steps.
By comparison,
if DLL resolution fails during process initialization,
there is nowhere to return the failure code.
You can’t return it to the program since the program isn’t running yet.
The only place to put the error is on the screen.</p>
