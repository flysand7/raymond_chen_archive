<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What are those little overlay icons?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
        Windows XP ships with a number of icon overlays.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
            A small arrow. Everybody knows this one: It’s the shortcut overlay.
        </li>
<li>
            A hand, palm up. This is the “sharing” overlay. A folder with this overlay is the
            root of a file share.
        </li>
<li>
            A downward-pointing blue arrow. This is the “to be written to CD” overlay.
        </li>
<li>
            A pair of blue swirling arrows. This sometimes baffles people. This means that the
            item is available offline. (You have to enable offline folders to get this.)
        </li>
<li>
            A black clock. This really baffles people. This means that the file has been archived
            to tape and will take a very long time to access.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
        The black clock is particularly baffling because you sometimes see it even if your
        system is not equipped with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/planning/management/remstore.asp">Hierarchical
        Storage Management</a>. When this happens, it’s because some program (typically a
        setup program) didn’t check error codes properly.
    </p>
<pre>CopyFileAttributes(LPCTSTR pszSrc, LPTSTR pszDst)
{
    SetFileAttributes(pszDst, GetFileAttributes(pszSrc));
}
</pre>
<p>
        The above code fragment fails to check for an error code from <code>GetFileAttributes</code>.
        It so happens that <code>GetFileAttributes</code> fails by returning the value 0xFFFFFFFF.
        If you fail to check this error code, you end up setting every possible attribute
        on the destination, including <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE</code>. <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE</code> is
        the flag that tells Explorer that the file has been archived to tape.
