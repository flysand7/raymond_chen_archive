<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED return false even when virtualization is enabled in the firmware?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Is­Processor­Feature­Present</code> function has a processor feature called <code>PF_</code><code>VIRT_</code><code>FIRMWARE_</code><code>ENABLED</code>. A customer enabled virtualization in their firmware, but calling <code>Is­Processor­Feature­Present</code> with that feature still returned <code>FALSE</code>. Why is this function lying?</p>
<p>It’s not lying.</p>
<p>Even if you enable virtualization in firmware, it may not actually be available. If the operating system is running inside a virtual machine, then it cannot access the virtualization extensions because the virtualization host is using them. Checking for <code>PF_</code><code>VIRT_</code><code>FIRMWARE_</code><code>ENABLED</code> will say “No virtual extensions for you.”</p>
<p>Even if you think that you’re not running inside a virtual machine, you could be. If Hyper-V is enabled, then the root operating system is not actually in charge. The root operating system is running inside its own virtual machine, under the control of the hypervisor.</p>
<p>And remember that features like Virtualization Based Security and and Windows Defender Application Guard are security features which secretly use Hyper-V to create virtual machines to isolate untrusted code into their own containers.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: I dimly recall that the IBM 360 supported self-virtualization, so you could have the host hypervisor create a virtual machine, and in the virtual machine, the operating system could itself act as a hypervisor for its own little universe of virtual machines. It’s virtual machine turtles all the way down!</p>
