<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The COM static store, part 3: Avoiding creation of an expensive temporary when setting a singleton</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, we looked at one way to <a href="/code/the-com-static-store-part-2-race-conditions-in-setting-a-singleton" title="The"> avoid a race condition when initializing a singleton in the COM static store</a>. But it did create the possibility of creating an object that might be thrown away, and that could be a problem if the object is expensive to construct, or if other circumstances prevent you from creating more than one of those objects.</p>
<p>In that case, you can expand the lock to cover the construction of the <code>Thing</code>, and construct it only if you’re sure you’re going to need it.</p>
<pre>Thing GetSingletonThing()
{
    auto props = CoreApplication::Properties();
    if (auto found = props.TryLookup(L"Thing")) {
        return found.as&lt;Thing&gt;();
    }
    auto guard = std::lock_guard(m_lock);
    if (auto found = props.TryLookup(L"Thing")) {
        return found.as&lt;Thing&gt;();
    }
    <span style="color: blue;">auto thing = MakeAThing();</span>
    props.Insert(L"Thing", thing);
    return thing;
}
</pre>
<p>This avoids the creation of a throwaway <code>Thing</code>, but it does come at a cost: Since the <code>Thing</code> is created under the lock, its constructor is at risk of deadlocking if it acquires its own locks or performs cross-thread operations.</p>
<p>Suppose there’s another lock <var>L</var>, and the caller of <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code> owns that lock. The <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code> function sees that there is no <code>Thing</code> yet, so it takes its own private lock, and then constructs a new <code>Thing</code>. If the <code>Thing</code> constructor also attempts to acquire lock <var>L</var>, and the lock <var>L</var> is non-recursive, then you have recursive acquisition of <var>L</var>, which is formally undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Even if the lock <var>L</var> allows recursive acquisition, you can still deadlock:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Thread 1</th>
<th>Thread 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Acquire lock <var>L</var></td>
<td>Call <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Call <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code></td>
<td>Object doesn’t exist yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Object doesn’t exist yet</td>
<td>Acquire lock <var>m_lock</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Wait for lock <var>m_lock</var></td>
<td>Object still doesn’t exist yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;"> </td>
<td>Construct a new <code>Thing</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;"> </td>
<td>Wait for lock <var>L</var></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here we hit a classic deadlock, where each thread holds one lock and is waiting for the other one.</p>
<p>But even if there is no lock <var>L</var>, you can still run into problems if the construction of <code>Thing</code> requires cross-thread operations.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Thread 1</th>
<th>Thread 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;"> </td>
<td>Call <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Call <code>Get­Singleton­Thing</code></td>
<td>Object doesn’t exist yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Object doesn’t exist yet</td>
<td>Acquire lock <var>m_lock</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;">Wait for lock <var>m_lock</var></td>
<td>Object still doesn’t exist yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;"> </td>
<td>Construct a new <code>Thing</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-right: solid 1px black;"> </td>
<td>Send a request to Thread 1 to do some work</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This time, Thread 2 is waiting for Thread 1 to do some work so it can finish constructing the <code>Thing</code>, but Thread 1 cannot do that work because it is waiting for the lock that protects <code>Thing</code> construction.</p>
<p>I’ve seen all of these types of deadlocks in production code. They hit rarely, but when they do, everybody has a bad day. Resolving the problem can be complicated because the locks or cross-thread operations are deeply embedded in the architecture, and a lot of refactoring has to be done to avoid dangerous operations while holding a lock.</p>
<p>So yeah, be extremely mindful about what you do while holding a lock. Don’t call out to foreign code while holding a lock.</p>
<p>Okay, enough about deadlocks. We’ll look at some ways of optimizing the COM singleton pattern next time.</p>
