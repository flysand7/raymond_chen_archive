<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When you create an object with constraints, you have to make sure everybody who uses the object understands those constraints</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Here’s a question that came from a customer.
This particular example involves managed code,
but don’t let that distract you from the point of the exercise.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I am trying to create a <code>FileStream</code>
object using the constructor that takes an <code>IntPtr</code> as input.
In my .cs file,
I create the native file handle using <code>CreateFile</code>,
as shown below.
</p>
<pre>
[DllImport("kernel32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Auto, SetLastError = true)]
internal static extern IntPtr CreateFile(string lpFileName,
    int dwDesiredAccess, FileShare dwShareMode,
    IntPtr securityAttrs, FileMode dwCreationDisposition,
    UInt32 dwFlagsAndAttributes, IntPtr hTemplateFile);
IntPtr ptr1 = Win32Native.CreateFile(FileName, 0x40000000,
         System.IO.FileShare.Read | System.IO.FileShare.Write,
         Win32Native.NULL,
         System.IO.FileMode.Create,
         0xa0000000, // FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING | FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH
         Win32Native.NULL);
</pre>
<p>
Then I create the <code>File­Stream</code> object as so:
</p>
<pre>
FileStream fs = new FileStream(ptr1, FileAccess.Write, true, 1, false);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>fs</code> gets created fine. But when I try to do:
</p>
<pre>
fs.Write(msg, 0, msg.Length);
fs.Flush();
</pre>
<p>
it fails with the error
“IO operation will not work.
Most likely the file will become too long
or the handle was not opened to support synchronous IO operations.”
</p>
<pre>
int hr = System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetHRForException(e)
</pre>
<p>
Gives <code>hr</code> as <code>COR_E_IO</code> (<code>0x80131620</code>).
</p>
<p>
The stack trace is as below.
</p>
<pre>
System.IO.IOException: IO operation will not work. Most likely
    the file will become too long or the handle was not opened
    to support synchronous IO operations.
at System.IO.FileStream.WriteCore(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 count)
at System.IO.FileStream.FlushWrite()
at System.IO.FileStream.Flush()
at PInvoke.Program.Main(String[] args)
</pre>
<p>
Can somebody point out what might be going wrong?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(For those who would prefer to cover their ears and hum when
the topic of managed code arises,
change <code>FileStream</code> to
<code>fdopen</code>.)
</p>
<p>
The comment on the line
</p>
<pre>
         0xa0000000, // FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING | FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH
</pre>
<p>
was provided by the customer, and that’s the key to the problem.
It was right there in the comment, but the customer didn’t understand
the consequences.
</p>
<p>
As the documentation for <code>Create­File</code> notes,
the <code>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</code>
flag requires that all I/O operations on the file handle
be in multiples of the sector size, and that the I/O buffers also
be aligned on addresses which are multiples of the sector size.
</p>
<p>
Since you created the file handle with very specific
rules for usage, you have to make sure that everybody who
uses it actually follows those rules.
On the other hand,
the <code>File­Stream</code> object doesn’t know about these rules.
It just figures you gave it a handle that it can issue normal
synchronous <code>Read­File</code> and <code>Write­File</code>
calls on.
It doesn’t know that you gave it a handle that requires
special treatment.
And then the attempt to write to the handle with a plain
<code>Write­File</code> fails both because the number
of bytes is not a multiple of the sector size and because
the I/O buffer is not sector-aligned, and you get the
I/O exception.
</p>
<p>
The solution to this problem depends on what you are trying to accomplish.
Why are you passing the
<code>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING |
FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH</code> flags?
Are you doing this just because you overheard in the hallway that it’s
faster?
Well, yes it may be faster under the right circumstances,
but in exchange for the increased performance, you also have to follow
a much stricter set of rules.
And in the absence of documentation to the contrary,
you can’t assume that a chunk of code actually adheres to your
very special rules.
</p>
<p>
Like <i>What if two people did this?</i>,
this is an illustration of
another principle that many people forget to consider
when working with objects they didn’t write:
<i>When you write your own code, do you do this?</i>
It’s sort of like the Golden Rule of programming.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have a function which accepts a file handle
and whose job is to write some data do that file handle.
Do you write your function so that it performs all its
I/O in multiples of the sector size from buffers which are
aligned in memory in multiples of the sector size,
on the off chance that somebody gave you a handle that was
opened with the <code>FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING</code> flag?
Well, no, you don’t.
You just call <code>Write­File</code> to write to it,
and if you want to write 28 bytes, you write 28 bytes.
Even if you perform internal buffering and your buffer size
happens to be a multiple of the sector size by accident,
you still don’t align your I/O buffer to the sector size;
and when it’s time to flush the final partially-written buffer,
you have a not-sector-multiple write at the very end anyway.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t handle this case in your code,
why would you expect others to handle it in their code?
</p>
<p>
We’ve seen this principle before,
such as when we looked at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/28/9148951.aspx">
whether the <code>Process.Refresh</code> method
refreshes an arbitrary application’s windows</a>.</p>
