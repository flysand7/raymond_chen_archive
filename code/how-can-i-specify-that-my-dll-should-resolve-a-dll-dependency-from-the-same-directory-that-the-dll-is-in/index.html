<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I specify that my DLL should resolve a DLL dependency from the same directory that the DLL is in?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a program that loaded two DLLs, let’s call them <code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code>. Both of those DLLs use a common helper DLL called <code>C.DLL</code>. The catch is that the two DLLs want to use <i>different incompatible versions</i> of <code>C.DLL</code>. The two DLLs <code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code> reside in separate folders, and each folder has a corresponding copy of <code>C.DLL</code>. </p>
<p>An additional complicating factor is that <code>A.DLL</code> was written by a third party and cannot be modified. </p>
<p>The customer was hoping there would be some way to get the two DLLs <code>A.DLL</code> and <code>B.DLL</code> to use their respective versions of <code>C.DLL</code>. They suspect that some magic with activation contexts and manifests might do the trick, but they didn’t have the expertise to figure out exactly what. (And remember that <code>A.DLL</code> came from a third party and cannot be modified.) </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/talagrand/">Eugene Talagrand</a> explained that you can solve the problem with manifests. Embed a manifest into <code>B.DLL</code> with resource ID 2 that looks like this: </p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
&lt;assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;file name="C.dll" /&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;
</pre>
<p>You don’t have to make any changes to the code that loads <code>B.DLL</code>. When you try to load <code>B.DLL</code>, the system will recognize the manifest, and that manifest tells the system to ignore any rogue copies of <code>C.DLL</code> and link <code>B.DLL</code> to the copy of <code>C.DLL</code> in the same directory. Furthermore, this special “<code>B.DLL</code>-specific” version of <code>C.DLL</code> is not made visible to other DLLs (unless they specifically ask for it with their own manifest), so when the program loads <code>A.DLL</code>, it will ignore the “<code>B.DLL</code>-specific” copy and look for <code>C.DLL</code> using the traditional search path. </p>
<p>The customer confirmed that adding the manifest to <code>B.DLL</code> worked! </p>
<p>Note that the manifest declaration applies to DLL dependencies resolved when <code>B.DLL</code> is loaded. If <code>B.DLL</code> performs a <code>LoadLibrary("C.DLL")</code> at run time, then it will need to make its activation context active when it loads the DLL so that the system knows to follow the instructions in the manifest.
