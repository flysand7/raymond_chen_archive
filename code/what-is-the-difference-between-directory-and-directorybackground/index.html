<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the difference between Directory and DirectoryBackground?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One item I left off the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/02/4179107.aspx"> list of special progids</a> is <code>Directory\Background</code>. </p>
<p> Recall that <code>Directory</code> is the progid for file system folders (a subset of <code>Folder</code> which represents all shell folders, both file system and virtual). Closely related is <code>Directory\Background</code>, which isn’t really a progid, but it is a place where shell extensions can register themselves. Specifically, it’s where context menu handlers can register if they want to appear when the user right-clicks on a blank space of a file system folder. </p>
