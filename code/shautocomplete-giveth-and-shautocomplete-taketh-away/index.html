<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">SHAutoComplete giveth, and SHAutoComplete taketh away</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code> function lets you attach
autocomplete functionality to an edit control,
and there are flags that describe what sources you want
the autocomplete to draw from.
If you call <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code> a second time,
the second set of flags replace the original flags.
The flags do not accumulate.
For example, if you first call
<code>SH­Auto­Complete(SHACF_FILESYS_ONLY)</code>, and then
you later call
<code>SH­Auto­Complete(SHACF_URLHISTORY)</code>,
the result is that the autocompletion uses only the URL history.
</p>
<p>
This replacement behavior (as opposed to accumulation behavior)
is handy if you want to <i>remove</i> an autocompletion that you
previously added.
You just call <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code> a second time
and leave off the flags for autocomplete sources you don’t want.
There’s a catch, though:
If you want to turn off everything, then you cannot pass zero,
because that gets interpreted as <code>SHACF_DEFAULT</code>.
You have to pass a nonzero value,
and fortunately there’s a handy nonzero value which means
<i>Turn off everything</i>:
<code>SHACF_AUTOSUGGEST_FORCE_OFF</code>.
</p>

Let’s illustrate this technique by disabling autocomplete
in the common dialog, a problem which
commenter Ian mistakenly
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx#9201524">
solved by modifying a global setting</a>.

#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlwapi.h&gt;
#include &lt;commctrl.h&gt;
#include &lt;commdlg.h&gt;
#include &lt;dlgs.h&gt;
UINT_PTR CALLBACK HookProc(HWND hdlg, UINT uMsg,
                           WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (uMsg) {
    case WM_INITDIALOG:
        PostMessage(hdlg, WM_APP, 0, 0);
        break;
    case WM_APP:
        SHAutoComplete(
          (HWND)SendDlgItemMessage(GetParent(hdlg), cmb13,
                                   CBEM_GETEDITCONTROL, 0, 0),
          SHACF_AUTOSUGGEST_FORCE_OFF);
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
                   LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd)
{
    TCHAR szFile[MAX_PATH];
    szFile[0] = TEXT('\0');
    OPENFILENAME ofn = { sizeof(ofn) };
    ofn.hInstance = hinst;
    ofn.lpstrFilter = TEXT("All files\0*.*\0");
    ofn.lpstrFile = szFile;
    ofn.nMaxFile = MAX_PATH;
    ofn.Flags = OFN_ENABLEHOOK | OFN_EXPLORER;
    ofn.lpfnHook = HookProc;
    GetOpenFileName(&amp;ofn);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The hook procedure uses the <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code>
function to turn off autocompletion on the file name
edit control in the common dialog.
There are a few annoying bits that I have to get through
before I finally make that <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code>
call:
First I have to find the edit control,
which means finding the combo box and then asking the combo box
for the interior edit control.
(Fortunately, this is already called out in the documentation
for <code>SH­Auto­Complete</code>, so I didn’t have to puzzle over
it for long.)
And second,
I couldn’t disable autocomplete directly in <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code>
because that happens too early in the common file dialog
initialization process.
Instead, I post myself a message and do the “final initialization”
later.
(This I discovered by trial and error.)
</p>
<p>
And there you have it, a common dialog box with no autocomplete.

<b>Update</b>:
<a href="http://www.deltics.co.nz/blog/">
Joylon Smith</a>
points out that
<a href="http://www.deltics.co.nz/blog/?p=630">
the documentation for <code>SHAutoComplete</code> explicitly
cautions against calling it more than once on the same window</a>
because it results in a memory leak.
</p>
<p>
That caution was written based on information I provided
back in Windows XP.
The memory leak was fixed in Windows Vista, but the documentation
was not updated to match.
So please mentally insert
“On versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista (and versions
of Windows Server prior to Windows Server 2008)” at the start of
that paragraph.
A doc change request has also been submitted, so hopefully the
revised documentation will appear soon.</p>
