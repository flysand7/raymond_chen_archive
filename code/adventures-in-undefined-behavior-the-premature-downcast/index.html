<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Adventures in undefined behavior: The premature downcast</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer encountered the following problem:
</p>
<pre>
class Shape
{
public:
    virtual bool Is2D() { return false; }
};
class Shape2D : public Shape
{
public:
    virtual bool Is2D() { return true; }
};
Shape *FindShape(Cookie cookie);
void BuyPaint(Cookie cookie)
{
    Shape2D *shape = static_cast&lt;Shape2D *&gt;(FindShape(cookie));
    if (shape-&gt;Is2D()) {
       .. do all sorts of stuff ...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Buy­Paint</code> function converts the cookie back
to a <code>Shape</code> object, and then checks if the object
is a <code>Shape2D</code> object by calling <code>Is­2D</code>.
If so, then it does some more stuff to figure out what type of paint
to buy.
</p>
<p>
(Note to nitpickers:
The actual scenario was not like this, but I presented it this way
to illustrate the point.
If you say “You should’ve
used RTTI” or “You should’ve had a BuyPaint method on the Shape class”,
then you’re missing the point.)
</p>
<p>
The programmers figured they’d save some typing by casting the
result of <code>Find­Shape</code> to a <code>Shape2D</code>
right away,
because after all, since <code>Is­2D</code> is a virtual
method, it will call the right version of the function,
either <code>Shape::Is­2D</code>
or <code>Shape2D::Is­2D</code>,
depending on the actual type of the underlying object.
</p>
<p>
But when compiler optimizations were turned on, they discovered
that the call to <code>Is­2D</code> was optimized away,
and the <code>Buy­Paint</code> function merely assumed
that it was always operating on a <code>Shape2D</code> object.
It then ended up trying to buy paint even for one-dimensional objects
like points and lines.
</p>
<p>
Compiler optimization bug?
Nope.
Code bug due to reliance on undefined behavior.
</p>
<p>
The C++ language says (9.3.1)
“If a nonstatic member function of a class <code>X</code>
is called for an object that is not of type <code>X</code>,
or of a type derived from <code>X</code>, the behavior is undefined.”
In other words,
if you are invoking a method on an object of type <code>X</code>,
then you are promising that it really is of type <code>X</code>,
or a class derived from it.
</p>
<p>
The code above violates this rule,
because it is invoking the <code>Is­2D</code> method
on a <code>Shape2D*</code>,
which therefore comes with the promise
“This really is a <code>Shape2D</code> object
(or something derived from it).”
But this is a promise the code cannot deliver on, because the
object returned by <code>Find­Shape</code> might be a simple
<code>Shape</code>.
</p>
<p>
The compiler ran with the (false) promise and said,
“Well, since you are guaranteeing that the object is at least
a <code>Shape2D</code>,
and since I have studied your code and determined that no
classes which further derive from <code>Shape2D</code> override
the <code>Is­2D</code> method,
I have therefore proved that the <i>final overrider</i> is
<code>Shape2D::Is­2D</code> and can therefore
inline that method.”
</p>
<p>
Result: The compiler inlines <code>Shape2D::Is­2D</code>,
which returns <code>true</code>, so the “if” test can be optimized out.
The compiler can assume that <code>Buy­Paint</code> is always
called with cookies that represent two-dimensional objects.
</p>
<p>
The fix is to do the annoying typing that the original authors
were trying to avoid:
</p>
<pre>
void BuyPaint(Cookie cookie)
{
    Shape *shape = FindShape(cookie);
    if (shape-&gt;Is2D()) {
      Shape2D *shape2d = static_cast&lt;Shape2D *&gt;(shape);
       .. do all sorts of stuff (with shape2d) ...
    }
}
</pre>
