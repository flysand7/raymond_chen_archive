wonders about those programs that flash their taskbar button
indefinitely</a>,
overriding the default flash count set by
<code>SysteParametersInfo(SPI_SETFOREGROUNDFLASHCOUNT)</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>FlashWindowEx</code> function
and its simpler precursor <code>FlashWindow</code>
let a program flash its window caption and taskbar button manually.
The window manager flashes the caption automatically
(and Explorer follows the caption by flashing the taskbar button)
if a program calls <code>SetForegroundWindow</code>
when it doesn’t have permission to take foreground,
and it is that automatic flashing that the
<code>SPI_SETFOREGROUNDFLASHCOUNT</code> setting controls.
</p>
<p>
For illustration purposes, I’ll demonstrate flashing the caption
manually.
This is generally speaking not recommended, but since you asked,
I’ll show you how.
And then promise you won’t do it.
</p>
<p>
Start with the scratch program and make this simple change:
</p>
<pre>
void
OnSize(HWND hwnd, UINT state, int cx, int cy)
{
  if (state == SIZE_MINIMIZED) {
    FLASHWINFO fwi = { sizeof(fwi), hwnd,
                       FLASHW_TIMERNOFG | FLASHW_ALL };
    FlashWindowEx(&amp;fwi);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Compile and run this program, then minimize it.
When you do, its taskbar button flashes indefinitely
until you click on it.
The program responds to being minimzed by calling the
<code>FlashWindowEx</code> function asking for everything possible
(currently the caption and taskbar button)
to be flashed until the window comes to the foreground.
</p>
<p>
Other members of the <code>FLASHWINFO</code> structure let
you customize the flashing behavior further,
such as controlling the flash frequency and the number of flashes.
and if you really want to take control,
you can use <code>FLASHW_ALL</code>
and <code>FLASHW_STOP</code> to turn your caption and taskbar
button on and off exactly the way you want it.
(Who knows, maybe you want to send a message in Morse code.)</p>
