<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A process shutdown puzzle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
In honor of National Puzzle Day,
I leave you today with a puzzle
based on an actual customer problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>Part One</b>: The customer explains the problem.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We have this DLL, and during its startup, it creates a thread
with the following thread procedure:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK ThreadFunction(void *)
{
  HANDLE HandleArray[2];
  HandleArray[0] = SetUpStuff();
  if (HandleArray[0]) {
    HandleArray[1] = ShutdownEvent;
    while (WaitForMultipleObjects(2, HandleArray,
                             FALSE, INFINITE) == WAIT_OBJECT_0) {
      ProcessStuff();
    }
    CleanUpStuff(HandleArray[0]);
  }
  SetEvent(ThreadCompleteEvent);
  FreeLibraryAndExitThread(ThisLibrary, 0);
}
</pre>
<p>
During process shutdown, the following function is called
as part of <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> handling:
</p>
<pre>
void StopWorkerThread()
{
  // tell the thread to stop
  SetEvent(ShutdownEvent);</pre></blockquote></p>
<p>  // wait for it to stop
  WaitForSingleObject(ThreadCompleteEvent, INFINITE);</p>
<p>  // Clean up
  CloseHandle(ShutdownEvent);
  ShutdownEvent = NULL;</p>
<p>  CloseHandle(ThreadCompleteEvent);
  ThreadCompleteEvent = NULL;
}

<p>
The above function is hanging at the call to
<code>WaitForSingleObject</code>.
If we break in, we see that the thread that is supposed
to be running the <code>ThreadFunction</code> is gone.
I verified that the thread was successfully created,
but by the time we get around to waiting for it, it’s already gone.
</p>
<p>
I checked, and nobody sets the <code>ThreadCompleteEvent</code>
except the <code>StopWorkerThread</code> function.
I stepped through <code>SetUpStuff</code>, and it succeeded.
However, a breakpoint on <code>CleanUpStuff</code> was never hit.
No exceptions were thrown either.
</p>
<p>
I am completely stumped as to how this thread disappeared.
</p>

<p>
You already know enough to explain how the thread disappeared.
</p>
<p>
<b>Part Two</b>: After providing your explanation, the customer
came up with this solution.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
Thank you for your explanation.
We’ve made the following changes to fix the problem.
Again, thank you for your help.
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK ThreadFunction(void *)
{
  HANDLE HandleArray[2];
  HandleArray[0] = SetUpStuff();
  if (HandleArray[0]) {
    HandleArray[1] = ShutdownEvent;
    while (WaitForMultipleObjects(2, HandleArray,
                             FALSE, INFINITE) == WAIT_OBJECT_0) {
      ProcessStuff();
    }
    CleanUpStuff(HandleArray[0]);
  }
  <font color="blue"><strike>// SetEvent(ThreadCompleteEvent);</strike></font>
  FreeLibraryAndExitThread(ThisLibrary, 0);
}</pre></blockquote></p>
<p>void StopWorkerThread()
{
  // tell the thread to stop
  SetEvent(ShutdownEvent);</p>
<p>  // wait for <font color="blue">the thread</font>
  WaitForSingleObject(<font color="blue">ThreadHandle</font>, INFINITE);</p>
<p>  // Clean up
  CloseHandle(ShutdownEvent);
  ShutdownEvent = NULL;
}


<p>
Criticize this proposed solution.
</p>
<p>
<b>Part Three</b>:
Even though the proposed solution is flawed,
explain why it doesn’t cause a problem in practice.
(I.e., explain why the customer is always lucky.)
</p></p>
