<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When will GetMessage return -1?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A source of great consternation is the mysterious <code>-1</code> return value from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644936(v=vs.85).aspx"> <code>Get­Message</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If there is an error, the return value is −1. For example, the function fails if <code>hWnd</code> is an invalid window handle or <code>lpMsg</code> is an invalid pointer.</p></blockquote>
<p>That paragraph has caused all sorts of havoc, because it throws into disarray the standard message pump:</p>
<pre>MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>But don’t worry, the standard message pump is safe. If your parameters are exactly</p>
<ul>
<li>a valid pointer to a valid <code>MSG</code> structure,</li>
<li>a null window handle,</li>
<li>no starting message range filter,</li>
<li>no ending message range filter,</li>
</ul>
<p>then <code>Get­Message</code> will not fail with <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>Originally, the <code>Get­Message</code> function did not have a failure mode. If you passed invalid parameters, then you invoked undefined behavior, and you probably crashed.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/10/9934911.aspx"> somebody said</a>, “Oh, no, the <code>Get­Message</code> function needs to detect invalid parameters and instead of crashing, it needs to fail gracefully with some sort of error code.” (This was before “Fail-Fast” came into fashion.)</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>Get­Message</code>‘s return value of <code>BOOL</code> was already specified not as a success/failure code, but rather a “Has a <code>WM_QUIT</code> message been received?” code. So return <code>FALSE</code> wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>The solution (if that’s what you want to call it) was to have <code>Get­Message</code> return the not-really-a-<code>BOOL</code>-but-we’ll-pretend-it-is value <code>-1</code> to signal an <i>invalid parameter</i> error.</p>
<p>And that’s what threw everybody into a tizzy, because now every message loop looks buggy.</p>
<p>But you can calm down. The standard message loop is fine. All the parameters are hard-coded (and therefore valid by inspection), save for the <code>&amp;msg</code> parameter, which is still valid by inspection. So that case is okay. It has to be, for compatibility.</p>
<p>The people who need to worry are people who pass a variable as the window handle filter (because that window handle may no longer be valid), or pass dynamically-allocated memory as the <code>lpMsg</code> (because the pointer may no longer be valid), or who pass a nontrivial message filter (because the filter parameters may be invalid).</p>
<p>In practice, the memory for the <code>lpMsg</code> is nearly always a stack variable (so the pointer is valid), and the message range filters are hard-coded (so valid by inspection). The one to watch out for is the window handle filter. But we saw earlier that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/09/369804.aspx"> a filtered <code>Get­Message</code> is a bad idea anyway</a>, because your program will not respond to messages that don’t meet the filter.</p>
