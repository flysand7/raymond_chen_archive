<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the difference between PathIsSystemFolder and Protected Operating System Files?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/19/8957958.aspx"> The way to detect weird directories that should be excluded from the user interface</a> is to check for the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN</code> and <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM</code> attributes being set simultaneously. This is the mechanism used <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/19/409620.aspx"> when you uncheck <i>Hide protected operating system files</i> in the Folder Options dialog</a>. (Programmatically, you detect whether the user wants to see protected operating system files by checking the <code>fShow­Super­Hidden</code> member of the <code>SHELL­STATE</code> structure.)
 Michael Dunn suggested <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/19/8957958.aspx#8959388"> using <code>Path­Is­System­Folder</code> to detect these special directories</a>, but that is not quite right.
 <code>Path­Is­System­Folder</code> is for marking a directory as “This directory has a nondefault UI behavior attached to it. Please consult the <code>desktop.ini</code> file for more information.” You do this when your directory is, say, the root of a namespace extension, or it has been subjected to folder customization. Windows uses it to indicate that the directory has a localized name, as well as other funky internal state.
 There are two ways to mark a folder as having nondefault UI. One is to set the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READ­ONLY</code> attribute, and the other is to set the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM</code> attribute.
 Either one works, and <code>Path­Is­System­Folder</code> checks for both, returning a nonzero value if either attribute is set.
 In its default configuration, Windows <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/30/55100.aspx"> uses the read-only flag to mark folders with nondefault UI</a>. However, some applications mistakenly believe that if a directory is marked read-only, then files within the directory cannot be modified. As a result, these applications refuse to let you save your documents onto the desktop, for example. To work around this, you can use the <code>Use­System­For­System­Folders</code> to tell Windows to use the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM</code> attribute instead. Of course, if you do that, you will run into problems with applications which mistakenly believe that if a directory is marked system, then the directory is inaccessible. So you get to pick your poison.
 Programmers who wish to mark a folder as having nondefault UI should use the <code>Path­Make­System­Folder</code> function to set the appropriate attribute. That function consults the system policy and sets the attribute that the policy indicates should be used to mark folders with nondefault UI.</p>
<p> Going back to the original question, then: The difference between <code>Path­Is­System­Folder</code> and checking for folders that are marked hidden+system is that they check different things and have different purposes. </p>
