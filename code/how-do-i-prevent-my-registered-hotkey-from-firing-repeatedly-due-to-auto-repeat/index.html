<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I prevent my registered hotkey from firing repeatedly due to auto-repeat?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You can register a global hotkey with the <code>Register­Hot­Key</code> function, but one problem many people have is that if the user presses and holds the hotkey sequence, the hotkey will be invoked as fast as auto-repeat will let it. For some types of hotkeys, this is not desirable. How do you prevent this? </p>
<p>Starting in Windows 7, you can pass the <code>MOD_</code><code>NO­REPEAT</code> flag to the <code>Register­Hot­Key</code> function to tell it not to generate <code>WM_</code><code>HOT­KEY</code> messages if the hotkey activation sequences was triggered by autorepeat. </p>
<p>The initial press of the hotkey will generate a <code>WM_</code><code>HOT­KEY</code> message, but the auto-repeats will not. </p>
