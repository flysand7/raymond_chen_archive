<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Use WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING to intercept window state changes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The <code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</code> message is sent early in the
window state changing process,
unlike
<code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED</code>,
which tells you about what already happened.
A crucial difference (aside from the timing)
is that you can influence the state change
by handling the <code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</code> message
and modifying the <code>WINDOWPOS</code> structure.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example that prevents the window from being resized.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL OnWindowPosChanging(HWND hwnd, WINDOWPOS *pwp)
{
    pwp-&gt;flags |= SWP_NOSIZE;
    /* Continue with default handling */
    return FORWARD_WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING(hwnd, pwp, DefWindowProc);
}
HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING, OnWindowPosChanging);
</pre>
<p>
Before the <code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</code> message was invented,
programs had to enforce window size constraints
inside their <code>WM_SIZE</code> and <code>WM_MOVE</code> handlers,
but since those messages are sent <i>after</i> the change is complete,
the result was flicker as the window changed to one size,
then the <code>WM_SIZE</code> handler resized it to a better size.
Intercepting the window size change in <code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</code>
allows you to enforce constraints before the sizing happens, thereby
avoiding flicker.
</p>
<p>
The <code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</code> and
<code>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED</code> pair of messages is just one example
of the more general <code>*CHANGING</code>/<code>*CHANGED</code> pattern.
(Other examples are <code>WM_STYLECHANGING</code>/<code>WM_STYLECHANGED</code>
and <code>LVN_ITEMCHANGING</code>/<code>LVN_ITEMCHANGED</code>.)
The <code>*CHANGING</code> half is sent before
the change takes place, and as a general rule,
you can change the parameters of the notification to enforce some
type of constraint.
After you return from the <code>*CHANGING</code> notification,
the actual change takes place, and then you receive a
<code>*CHANGED</code> to indicate that the change is complete.</p>
