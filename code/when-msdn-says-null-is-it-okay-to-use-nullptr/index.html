<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When MSDN says <code>NULL</code>, is it okay to use <code>nullptr</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In various places, MSDN will talk about the behavior corresponding to the case where a handle type has the value <code>NULL</code>. A customer wanted to know whether it was safe to use <code>nullptr</code> in such cases, or whether they have to use <code>NULL</code>. </p>
<p>Although the programming languages used by MSDN for documenting Windows are putatively C and C++, MSDN understands that a lot of people write code for Windows in other languages, and therefore it tries to avoid <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050628-07/?p=35183">relying on language subtleties</a>. </p>
<p>Esoteric definitions for the term <code>NULL</code> is one of those language subtleties. </p>
<p>Formally, the C and C++ languages permit the following definitions for the <code>NULL</code> macro: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th><code>NULL</code></th>
<th><code>0</code></th>
<th><code>(void*)0</code></th>
<th><code>nullptr</code></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>C</th>
<td>allowed</td>
<td>allowed</td>
<td>not allowed¹</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>C++</th>
<td>allowed</td>
<td>not allowed²</td>
<td>allowed</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If <code>NULL</code> is defined as <code>(void*)0</code> in C or as <code>nullptr</code> in C++, then it can be assigned only to a pointer type. And since MSDN cannot control how the C and C++ header files define <code>NULL</code>, it needs to work with any definition that is permitted by the corresponding standards. Which means that saying <code>NULL</code> implies that the underlying type is a pointer type. </p>
<p>Therefore, you are welcome to write <code>nullptr</code> instead of <code>NULL</code> if you’re writing C++ code. You’re also welcome to write anything else that produces a null pointer, such as </p>
<pre>
HMUMBLE h1 = HMUMBLE();
HMUMBLE h2 = HMUMBLE{};
HMUMBLE h3 = HMUMBLE(0);
HMUMBLE h4 = (HMUMBLE)0;
HMUMBLE h5 = 3 - 3;
</pre>
<p>But most people would probably prefer you to write <code>NULL</code> or <code>nullptr</code>. </p>
<p>As noted, MSDN understands that a significant portion of its readership is not fluent in the subtleties of C and C++. When it writes <code>NULL</code>, it means the obvious thing: A null pointer. You can translate that into the appropriate construction for the language you are using. For example, for C#, you can use <code>null</code>, or if you are operating in raw <code>IntPtr</code>s, you can use <code>IntPtr.Zero</code>. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: When MSDN says <code>NULL</code>, is it okay to use <code>0</code>? Yes, but you probably don’t want to. Using <code>0</code> as a null pointer constant is permitted by the C and C++ languages for backward compatbility reasons, but it’s not considered modern style. </p>
<p><b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>: I’m told that the Visual C++ folks occasionally entertain the possibility of changing the definition of <code>NULL</code> to <code>nullptr</code>, which is permitted by the standard. However, this ends up breaking a lot of code which assumed that <code>NULL</code> is an integral constant evaluating to zero. For example: </p>
<pre>
void foo(char* p)
{
  char c = NULL; // would not work if NULL were defined as nullptr
  *p = NULL;     // would not work if NULL were defined as nullptr
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>Although that code is technically already broken, it manages to work if <code>NULL</code> is defined as <code>0</code>, and updating the definition in the language header files would break existing (albeit poorly-written) code. </p>
<p>¹ C does not have the <code>nullptr</code> keyword. </p>
<p>² C++ does not allow <code>NULL</code> to be defined as <code>(void*)0</code> because C++ does not permit implicit conversion from <code>void*</code> to arbitrary <code>T*</code>. </p>
<pre>
int* p = (void*)0; // allowed in C but not C++
</pre>
