<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If only DLLs can get DllMain notifications, how can an EXE receive a notification when a thread is created (for example)?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
When a DLL is loaded, it receives a
<code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> notification,
and when it is unloaded (or when the process terminates),
it gets a
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification.
DLLs also receive
<code>DLL_THREAD_ATTACH</code> notifications
when a thread is created and
<code>DLL_THREAD_DETACH</code> notifications
when a thread exits.
But what if you are an EXE?
EXEs don’t have a <code>Dll­Main</code>,
so there is no way to receive these notifications.
</p>
<p>
The trick here is to hire a lackey.
</p>
<p>
Create a helper DLL, called, say, <code>LACKEY.DLL</code>.
Your EXE links to the lackey,
and the lackey’s job is to forward all
<code>Dll­Main</code> notifications back to your EXE.
The DLL would naturally have to have a way for your EXE
to provide the callback address,
so
you might have a function
<code>Register­Lackey­Callback</code>.
</p>
<pre>
typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *LACKEYNOTIFICATION)(DWORD dwReason);
LACKEYNOTIFICATION g_lackeyNotification;
void RegisterLackeyCallback(LACKEYNOTIFICATION lackeyNotification)
{
 g_lackeyNotification = lackeyNotification;
}
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
 if (g_lackeyNotification) g_lackeyNotification(dwReason);
 return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, it is rather extravagant to hire a lackey just for
this one task,
so you will probably just add lackey responsibilities to
some other DLL you’ve written.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if there’s a name for this design pattern,
so I’m just going to call it the <i>hired lackey</i> pattern.</p>
