<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Signs that the symbols in your stack trace are wrong</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One of the things programmers send to each other when they
are trying to collaborate on a debugging problem is stack traces.
Usually something along the lines of
“My program does X, then Y, then Z, and then it crashes.
Here is a stack trace.
Can you tell me what’s wrong?”
</p>
<p>
It helps if you at least glance at the stack trace before
you send it, because there are often signs that the stack
trace you’re about to send is completely useless because
the symbols are wrong.
Here’s an example:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We are testing our program and it gradually grinds to a halt.
When we connect a debugger, we find that all of our threads,
no matter what they are doing, eventually wind up
hung in <code>kernel32!EnumResourceLanguagesA</code>.
Can someone explain why that function is hanging,
and why it seems all roads lead to it?

This stack trace looks suspicious for a variety of reasons.
</p>
<p>
First of all,
look at that offset
<code>EnumResourceLanguagesA+<u>0xbea00</u></code>.
It’s unlikely that the
<code>EnumResourceLanguagesA</code>
function (or any other function)
is over 750KB in size, as this offset suggests.
</p>
<p>
Second, it’s unlikely that the <code>EnumResourceLanguagesA</code>
function (or any other function, aside from obvious cases
like tree walking) is recursive.
And it’s certainly unlikely that a huge function will also be
recursive.
</p>
<p>
Third, it seems unlikely that the <code>EnumResourceLanguagesA</code>
function would call,
<code>NETAPI32!I_NetGetDCList</code>.
What does enumerating resource languages have to do with getting
a DC list?
</p>
<p>
Fourth, look at those functions that are allegedly
callers of <code>EnumResourceLanguagesA</code>:
<code>bogosoft!CObjMarker::RequestBlockForFetch</code>,
<code>bsnetlib!CSubsystem::CancelMain</code>,
<code>bsnetlib!Tcp::ReadSync</code>.
Why would any of these functions want to enumerate resource
languages?
</p>
<p>
These symbols are obvious wrong.
The huge offsets are present because the debugger has access only
to exported functions,
and it’s merely showing you the name of the nearest symbol,
even though it has nothing to do with the actual function.
It’s just using the nearest signpost it can come up with.
It’s like if somebody gave you directions to the movie theater like this:
“Go to city hall downtown and then go north for 35 miles.”
This doesn’t mean that the movie theater is in the downtown district
or that the downtown district is 35 miles long.
It’s just that the person who’s giving you directions can’t come
up with a better landmark than city hall.
</p>
<p>
This is just another case of the principle that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/10/661389.aspx">
you have to know what’s right before you can see what’s wrong</a>.
If you have no experience with good stack traces,
you don’t know how to recognize a bad one.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and even though the functions in question are in
<code>kernel32</code>,
you can still get symbols for that DLL
with the help of the

Microsoft Symbol Server</a>.</p>
