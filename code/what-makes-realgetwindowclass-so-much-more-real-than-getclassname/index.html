<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What makes RealGetWindowClass so much more real than GetClassName?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
There’s
<code>Get­Class­Name</code>
and then there’s
<code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code>.
What makes
<code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code> more real?
</p>
<p>
Recall from last time that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/30/10110077.aspx">
the <code>Real...</code> functions were added to support
Windows accessibility</a>.
The goal with <code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code> is to help
accessibility tools identify what kind of window it is working with,
even if the application did a little disguising in the form of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633569.aspx#winproc_superclassing">
superclassing</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you ask
<code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code> for the class name of a window,
it digs through all the superclassing and returns the name of the
base class (if the base class is one of the standard window manager classes).
For example, if your application superclassed the <code>button</code>
class,
a call to <code>Get­Class­Name</code> would return
<code>Awesome­Button</code>,
but a call to
<code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code> would return <code>button</code>.
Returning the underlying window class allows accessibility tools
to know that the user is interacting with some type of button control
(albeit a customized one),
so that it can adjust the interaction to something appropriate
for buttons.
Without <code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code>,
the accessibility tool would just see <code>Awesome­Button</code>,
and it would probably shrug and say,
“I have no idea what a <code>Awesome­Button</code> is.”
</p>
<p>
(I guess you could have the accessibility tool do a
<code>strstr</code> for <code>button</code>,
but then it would be faked out by classes like
<code>Button­Bar</code> or applications which superclass
a button but call it something completely different like
<code>Awesome­Radio</code>.)
</p>
<p>
If you read the <code>winuser.h</code> header file,
you can see a comment next to the
<code>Real­Get­Window­Class</code>
function:
</p>
<pre>
/*
 * This gets the name of the window TYPE, not class.  This allows us to
 * recognize ThunderButton32 et al.
 */
</pre>
<p>
What is <code>Thunder­Button32</code>?
</p>
<p>
<b>Thunder</b> was
<a href="http://www.forestmoon.com/birthofvb/birthofvb.html">
the code name for Visual Basic 1.0</a>.
Visual Basic superclassed all the standard Windows controls
and called its superclassed version <code>Thunder­Whatever</code>.</p>
