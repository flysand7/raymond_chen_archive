<body style=max-width:80ch;margin:auto>
<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A shortcut to the Run dialog</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Here’s a little script that opens the Run dialog.
You can save it as “Run.js” and double-click it.
</p>
<pre>
(new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application")).FileRun();
</pre>
<p>
The advantage of this approach over various others people have come
up with is that this one is actually
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/objects/shell/filerun.asp">
documented</a>.
(And therefore is less likely to break in the next version of the
operating system.)</p>
