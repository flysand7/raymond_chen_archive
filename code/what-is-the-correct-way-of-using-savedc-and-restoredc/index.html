<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the correct way of using SaveDC and RestoreDC?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There are these two functions <code>SaveDC</code> and <code>RestoreDC</code>. How do they work? </p>
<p>Each device context (DC) maintains a stack of saved states. When you call <code>SaveDC</code>, the current state of the DC is saved and pushed onto the stack, and you get a positive integer representing that saved state. If you call <code>SaveDC</code> again, a new saved state is created and pushed onto the stack, and you get a new integer that represents the second state. Each call to <code>SaveDC</code> pushes the current state onto this internal stack. </p>
<p>There are two ways to call the <code>RestoreDC</code> function. One is to pass a negative number. This indicates how many states to pop off the stack, and the last state popped off the stack is applied to the DC. </p>
<p>The other (more common) way to call the <code>RestoreDC</code> function is to pass a specific state. In that case, the specific state is restored, and that state is popped off the stack. And since it’s a stack, this also means that any states that were pushed onto the stack after that point are also popped off. </p>
<p>And of course you cannot restore a state to a DC different from the DC you saved it from. (Because each DC has a separate stack of saved states.) </p>
<p>For concreteness, let’s say that we’ve saved the state three times: </p>
<pre>
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(NULL_BRUSH));
int state1 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH));
int state2 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(BLACK_BRUSH));
int state3 = SaveDC(hdc);
SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH));
</pre>
<p>State 1 has the null brush, state 2 has the white brush, state 3 has the black brush, and the current state (not saved) has the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050420-28/?p=35843">DC brush</a>. </p>
<p>Here’s what could happen next: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Negative argument</th>
<th>Equivalent positive argument</th>
<th>Result</th>
<th>Stack</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-1)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state3)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is black</td>
<td>state2 (top), state1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-2)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state2)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is white</td>
<td>state1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>RestoreDC(-3)</code></td>
<td><code>RestoreDC(state1)</code></td>
<td>Current brush is null</td>
<td>empty</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Note that the state that is applied gets popped off the stack, which means that each state can be restored at most once. </p>
