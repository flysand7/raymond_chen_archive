<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When you call <code>Open­Thread­Token</code> while impersonating, you have to say who is asking for the thread token</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that <code>Open­Thread­Token</code> was failing with the error <code>ACCESS_</code><code>DENIED</code> and wanted help understanding why. They shared a code fragment which operates on an account name <code>test</code> with no special privileges. </p>
<pre>
<i>// Code in italics is wrong

int main()
{
  HANDLE hToken = NULL;

  // This succeeds.
  LogonUser(L"test", L".", L"test@123",
    LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE, LOGON32_PROVIDER_DEFAULT,
    &amp;hToken);

  // This also succeeds.
  ImpersonateLoggedOnUser(hToken);

  // During this Sleep, <a href="https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/">Process Hacker</a> shows that the thread
  // is impersonating.
  Sleep(10'000);

  // This fails with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
  OpenThreadToken(GetCurrentThread(), TOKEN_QUERY,
    FALSE, &amp;hToken);

  return 0;
}</i>

<p>According to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379296(v=vs.85).aspx">the documentation for <code>Open­Thread­Token</code></a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p><i>OpenAsSelf</i> [in] </p>
<p><b>TRUE</b> if the access check is to be made against the process-level security context. </p>
<p><b>FALSE</b> if the access check is to be made against the current security context of the thread calling the <b>Open­Thread­Token</b> function. </p>
<p>The <i>OpenAsSelf</i> parameter allows the caller of this function to open the access token of a specified thread when the caller is impersonating a token at <b>Security­Identification</b> level. <u>Without this parameter, the calling thread cannot open the access token on the specified thread  because it is impossible to open executive-level objects by using the <b>Security­Identification</b> impersonation level</u>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, as I discussed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">some time ago</a>, </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>When a new kernel object is created, and you don’t provide an explicit security descriptor for the new object, then the object is given a default security descriptor. And that default security descriptor comes from the default DACL of the token that is in effect at the point of the call. </p>
<p>When you apply this rule to tokens, you find that, even though the behavior is consistent with other kernel objects, it also means that it is <u>very easy to create a token that doesn’t have access to itself</u>. When you impersonate with that token, bad things happen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The code fragment above passes <code>FALSE</code>, which means that the access check is made against the current security context, which is the impersonated test user, and that user doesn’t have access to the token. </p>
<p>Note that changing <code>FALSE</code> to <code>TRUE</code> is only the first step in what may be a long uphill struggle. One of my colleagues on the security team added that if you don’t have the <b>Se­Impersonate­Privilege</b> for your process, you will run into other problems as well. The customer didn’t explain the scenario where they think impersonation is a step in the solution, so it’s hard to elaborate on what else can go wrong, because we don’t know what they’re trying to do. </p>
