<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Execute a file as if it were a program, even though its extension is not EXE</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program executes a file as if it were a program,
even though its extension is not EXE.
The idea here is to prevent somebody from running your program
by accident, so you give it an extension like <code>.MOD</code>.
This is great for preventing somebody from running the program
by mistake, but how do you do it on purpose?

<pre>
#define STRICT
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shellapi.h&gt;
int WINAPI WinMain(
    HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
    LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
  SHELLEXECUTEINFO sei = { 0 };
  sei.cbSize = sizeof(sei);
  sei.nShow = SW_SHOWNORMAL;
  sei.lpFile = TEXT("C:\\full\\path\\to\\program.mod");
  sei.fMask = SEE_MASK_CLASSNAME;
  sei.lpVerb = TEXT("open");
  sei.lpClass = TEXT("exefile");
  ShellExecuteEx(&amp;sei);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

We’re merely
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/01/10033224.aspx">
using the <code>lpClass</code> member of the
<code>SHELL­EXECUTE­INFO</code> structure</a>
to force the file to be interpreted as the type we specify,
overriding the default type inference code.</p>
