<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I tell that a directory is really a recycle bin?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Here’s a question inspired by an actual customer question:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
I need a function that, given a path, tells me whether it is
a Recycle Bin folder.
I tried using functions like <code>SHGetSpecialFolderPath</code>
with <code>CSIDL_BITBUCKET</code>, but that doesn’t work because
the Recycle Bin is a virtual folder that is the union of the
Recycle Bins of all drives.
</blockquote>
<p>
The customer noted that they don’t want to hard-code the words
<code>RECYCLED</code> and <code>RECYCLER</code>,
which is a good decision because
the name of the directory
depends on many things.
I mentioned earlier that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/31/520225.aspx">
it depends on the file system</a>.
It also depends on whether the drive is accessed locally or remotely;
network-based Recycle Bin folders follow yet another naming scheme.
It may even depend on what operating system the user is running.
No, hard-coding the name of the Recycle Bin folders is not a good idea.
</p>
<p>
The <code>SHDESCRIPTIONID</code> structure tells you a little more
about a shell folder.
In addition to the “description ID”, it also gives you a <code>CLSID</code>,
and it is the <code>CLSID</code> that is relevant here.

<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#include &lt;tchar.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</pre></p>
<p>HRESULT
GetFolderDescriptionId(LPCWSTR pszPath, SHDESCRIPTIONID *pdid)
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPITEMIDLIST pidl;
  if (SUCCEEDED(hr = SHParseDisplayName(pszPath, NULL,
                                        &amp;pidl, 0, NULL))) {
    IShellFolder *psf;
    LPCITEMIDLIST pidlChild;
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr = SHBindToParent(pidl, IID_IShellFolder,
                                    (void**)&amp;psf, &amp;pidlChild))) {
      hr = SHGetDataFromIDList(psf, pidlChild,
                     SHGDFIL_DESCRIPTIONID, pdid, sizeof(*pdid));
      psf-&gt;Release();
    }
    CoTaskMemFree(pidl);
  }
  return hr;
}</p>
<p>int __cdecl wmain(int argc, WCHAR **argv)
{
  SHDESCRIPTIONID did;
  if (SUCCEEDED(GetFolderDescriptionId(argv[1], &amp;did)) &amp;&amp;
      did.clsid == CLSID_RecycleBin) {
    printf(“is a recycle bin\n”);
  } else {
    printf(“is not a recycle bin\n”);
  }
  return 0;
}

<p>
The <code>GetFolderDescriptionId</code> function
takes the path to a folder
and converts it to an <code>ITEMIDLIST</code>
just so it can call <code>SHGetDataFromIDList</code>
to obtain the <code>SHDESCRIPTIONID</code>.
All we care about in this case
is whether the <code>CLSID</code>
is the Recycle Bin or not.

C:\&gt; checkrecycle C:\Windows
is not a recycle bin
C:\&gt; checkrecycle C:\RECYCLER\S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-72713
is a recycle bin

Of course, now that I told you how to do it, I have to tell
you that this is not how to do it.
This is another example of a customer having a problem,
solving half of it, and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/23/558887.aspx">
asking for help with the other half</a>,
unaware that they are approaching the problem from the wrong
direction.
Next time, we’ll look at the customer’s <i>real</i> problem.
