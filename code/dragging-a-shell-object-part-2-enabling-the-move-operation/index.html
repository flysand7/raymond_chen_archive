<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dragging a shell object, part 2: Enabling the Move operation</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Let’s say that we did want to support Move in our
drag/drop program, for whatever reason.
Let’s do it with some scratch file instead
of <code>clock.avi</code>, though.  Create a file somewhere
that you don’t mind losing; let’s say it’s <code>C:\throwaway.txt</code>.
Change the function <code>OnLButtonDown</code> as follows:
</p>
<pre>
void OnLButtonDown(HWND hwnd, BOOL fDoubleClick,
                   int x, int y, UINT keyFlags)
{
  IDataObject *pdto;
  if (SUCCEEDED(GetUIObjectOfFile(hwnd,
                    <font color="blue">L”C:\\throwaway.txt”</font>,
                    IID_IDataObject, (void**)&amp;pdto))) {
    IDropSource *pds = new CDropSource();
    if (pds) {
      DWORD dwEffect;
      <font color="blue">if (DoDragDrop(pdto, pds,
                 DROPEFFECT_COPY | DROPEFFECT_LINK | DROPEFFECT_MOVE,
                 &amp;dwEffect) == DRAGDROP_S_DROP) {
        if (dwEffect &amp; DROPEFFECT_MOVE) {
          DeleteFile(TEXT(“C:\\throwaway.txt”));
        }
      }</font>
      pds-&gt;Release();
    }
    pdto-&gt;Release();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Oh wait, there are people out there who think I’m advocating hard-coded
paths, so let me change the program to operate on a path passed on the
command line.
This is code that is purely a distraction from the point of this
article, which is why I avoided it originally.
Personally I dislike it when somebody hands me a sample program
that is 90% unrelated to the technology the program is trying to demonstrate.
I have to go
digging through the code hunting for the 10% of stuff that matters.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">#include &lt;shellapi.h&gt;</font></pre></p>
<p>LPWSTR *g_argv;
LPCWSTR g_pszTarget;</p>
<p>void OnLButtonDown(HWND hwnd, BOOL fDoubleClick,
                   int x, int y, UINT keyFlags)
{
  IDataObject *pdto;
  if (SUCCEEDED(GetUIObjectOfFile(hwnd,
                    <font color="blue">g_pszTarget</font>,
                    IID_IDataObject, (void**)&amp;pdto))) {
  …
          DeleteFile<font color="blue">W(g_pszTarget</font>);
  …
}</p>
<p>BOOL
InitApp(void)
{
  <font color="blue">int argc;
  g_argv = CommandLineToArgvW(GetCommandLineW(), &amp;argc);
  if (!g_argv || argc != 2) return FALSE;
  g_pszTarget = g_argv[1];
  if (PathIsRelative(g_pszTarget)) return FALSE;</font>
  …
}

<p>
Woo-hoo, eight distracting lines of code that have nothing to do
with the subject of dragging shell objects around.  I hope you’re
happy.
</p>
<p>
Where was I?  Oh right, explaining the first batch of blue code
that by now has scrolled off your screen thanks to the intervening
meaningless drivel.
</p>
<p>
Now that we allow move, we need to check whether the resulting effect
was <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code>, which tells us,
“The drop target wanted to perform a move operation, but it only
got as far as copying the object; please finish the move operation
by deleting the original.”
</p>
<p>
Notice that <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> does <strong>not</strong>
mean, “The drop target performed a move.”
Rather, it tells you that the drop target wants you to delete
the original.
If the drop target was able to delete the original (or move it
directly), then you will not get
<code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> back.
</p>
<p>
(One case where <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> doesn’t even mean
that a Move operation occurred at all is if the user dragged
the object to an “Incinerator” icon, the purpose of which is
to destroy whatever is dropped onto it.  In this case the
Incinerator would return <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> without
even making a copy. Result: The object is deleted.
A better name for <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> would have been
<code>DROPEFFECT_DELETEORIGINAL</code>.)
</p>
<p>
If the data object represents a file, then the shell is pretty
good at figuring out how to move the file to the destination
instead of copying it and asking you to delete the original.
You will typically get <code>DROPEFFECT_MOVE</code> back only
if the data object represents a non-file, since in that case
the shell doesn’t know how to delete the original.
</p>
<p>
But what if you want to know whether the operation was a move,
regardless of whether the operation was optimized by the drop
target?
We’ll look at that next time.
</p>
<p>
(By the way, if you execute a Move of the throwaway file,
don’t forget to move it back so you can run the scratch
program again!)
