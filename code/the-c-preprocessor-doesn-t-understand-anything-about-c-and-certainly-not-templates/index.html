<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The C++ preprocessor doesn’t understand anything about C++, and certainly not templates</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The C and C++ preprocessors are like the Windows command prompt batch language: They implement a very simple language that people still use for some reason, usually by pushing it way beyond its original design boundaries.</p>
<p>The preprocessors don’t really understand the C or C++ language. It does, fortunately, use the same arithmetic operators that the C and C++ language uses, but its understanding of them is limited to integers.</p>
<p>The treatment of commas in preprocessor arguments is very simple: Commas separate macro arguments. The only way to protect a comma is to enclose it in matched parentheses.</p>
<pre>#define M(cond, action) if (cond) action // horrible macro

M(function(2, 3), return) // okay
</pre>
<p>Note that the less-than and greater-than signs do not protect commas. This can create confusion if you want to pass a template instantiation as a macro parameter.</p>
<pre>M(std::is_same_v&lt;T, U&gt;, return); // doesn't compile
</pre>
<p>The preprocessor isn’t smart enough to realize that what you passed was intended to be a template instantiation. After all, maybe you wanted this:</p>
<pre>M(value &lt; 0 || height &gt; 1000, return out_of_range);
</pre>
<p>In this case, the less-than and greater-than signs are intended to be the comparison operators. But from the preprocessor’s point of view, the angle brackets in</p>
<pre>    std::is_same_v&lt; T, U &gt;
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>    value &lt; 0 || height &gt; 1000
</pre>
<p>are basically the same thing. It has no way of knowing that the first case of matched angle brackets is a template instantiation, whereas the second is just a pair of comparison operators. Not even the compiler knows, because we are still preprocessing. Compilation hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>The solution is to insert seemingly-spurious parentheses around the macro argument.</p>
<pre>M((std::is_same_v&lt;T, U&gt;), return);
</pre>
