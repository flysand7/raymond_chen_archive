<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I conditionally compile based on a preprocessor macro value, while ensuring that the macro is correctly spelled?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Continuing on the extremely sporadic topic of <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180628-00/?p=99115">stupid C preprocessor tricks</a>. </p>
<p>It is common to have preprocessor macros that control compile-time behavior. C++11 has <code>std::enable_if</code> to conditionally remove functions and template specializations from consideration, and C++17 adds <code>if constexpr</code> to allow statements to removed conditionally. Removing variables is a bit trickier, though. You can probably manage it by wrapping the variable inside a class that itself uses <code>std::enable_if</code>, but that’s even more clunky than <code>std::enable_if</code> already is. </p>
<p>Anyway, for whatever reason, you might want to use the preprocessor’s <code>#if</code> directive to perform your tests. Maybe you are preprocessing something for a purpose other than compilation by a C or C++ compiler. </p>
<p>But you’re also worried that somebody might misspell your symbol. </p>
<pre>
// The FEATURE_BLAH macro is defined either as 0 or 1

#if FEATURE_BLUH
... do stuff with feature Blah ...
#endif
</pre>
<p>Oops, they misspelled <code>FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH</code>, but the preprocessor doesn’t know that, so it happily says, “Nope, it’s not defined, skip the body of the <code>#if</code>.” </p>
<p>How do you catch this typo? </p>
<p>You can use your adversary’s power against him. </p>
<p>Since undefined symbols are treated as having the value zero, you can use an expression that blows up if the value is zero. </p>
<pre>
// The FEATURE_BLAH macro is defined either as 1 (off) or 2 (on)

#define GET_NONZERO_VALUE(x) (0/(x) + (x))

#if GET_NONZERO_VALUE(FEATURE_BLAH) == 2
... do stuff with feature Blah ...
#endif
</pre>
<p>The <code>GET_<code></code>NONZERO_<code></code>VALUE</code> macro first tries to divide by its parameter. If the parameter is not defined or is defined with the value zero, then that results in a division by zero and you get a compiler error. If the parameter is defined with a nonzero value, then the result of <code>0/(x)</code> is zero, and adding that to <code>x</code> yields <code>x</code>. </p>
<p>The last wrinkle is using the <code>defined</code> preprocessor pseudo-function to distinguish between an undefined macro and a defined macro whose value is zero. </p>
<pre>
// The FEATURE_BLAH macro is defined to 0 or 1
// The FEATURE_BLAH_OPTION macro is some value

#define GET_FEATURE_VALUE(x) (0/defined(FEATURE_##x) + (FEATURE_##x))

#if GET_FEATURE_VALUE(BLAH)
#if GET_FEATURE_VALUE(BLAH_OPTION) == 1
... do stuff with feature Blah and option 1...
#elif GET_FEATURE_VALUE(BLAH_OPTION) == 2
... do stuff with feature Blah and option 2...
#else
#error Unknown option for FEATURE_BLAH_OPTION.
#endif
#endif
</pre>
<p>If <code>FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH</code> is not defined, then the <code>defined(FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH)</code> will evaluate to zero, and then you get a divide by zero error in the preprocessor. If it is defined, then <code>defined(FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH)</code> evaluates to 1, and the expression <code>0/1 + FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH</code> reduces to just <code>FEATURE_<code></code>BLAH</code>. </p>
<p>This is an abuse of the preprocessor, but it may come in handy in a pinch. </p>
