<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Programming means that sometimes you have to snap two blocks together</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Part of the challenge of programming (and for some people, the reason why programming is fun in the first place) is looking at the building blocks provided to you and deciding how to assemble them to build something new. After all, if everything you wanted a program to do already existed ready-made, it wouldn’t be called <i>programming</i> any more. It would be called <i>shopping</i>.</p>

<p> I replied, “<a href="http://www.lego.com/">The LEGO Group</a> does not make a piece for every possible object. Sometimes you just have to take two LEGO blocks and click them together. Here are some interesting blocks: <code>GetCursorPos</code>, <code>WindowFromPoint</code>.”</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Thanks for your reply. But <code>WindowFromPoint</code> gives me the window of the object at the location of the cursor. But I’m looking for the top level window containing the cursor. </p></blockquote>
<p> Fine, then use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632676.aspx"> a different block</a>.
 I wonder how it is these people manage to write programs at all. I get the impression they write code by asking a million tiny questions and cutting and pasting together all the replies.</p>
<p> No wait, pasting together the replies counts as snapping blocks together. Maybe they just ask for completed programs. </p>
