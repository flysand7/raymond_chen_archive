<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does PathIsUNC say that paths that begin with \\?\ are not UNCs?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>An application vendor opened a bug with the product team saying that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773712(v=vs.85).aspx">the <code>Path­Is­UNC</code> function</a> was returning incorrect values in Windows Vista. Specifically, the <code>Path­Is­UNC</code> function was returning <code>FALSE</code> for strings that begin with <code>\\?\</code>, whereas Windows XP returned <code>TRUE</code>. </p>
<p>The answer is, “Yes, the <code>Path­Is­UNC</code> function returns <code>FALSE</code> for strings that begin with <code>\\?\</code>. Because they aren’t UNCs.” </p>
<p>There was a bug in the Windows XP version of the <code>Path­Is­UNC</code> function where it reported that anything that began with two backslashes was a UNC, even if it wasn’t. In particular, paths that begin with <code>\\?\</code> are not UNCs, unless they happen to begin with <code>\\?\UNC\</code>. The bug was fixed in Windows Vista so it returned <code>TRUE</code> only if the <code>\\?\</code> is followed by <code>UNC\</code>. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the application compatibility team had a ready answer for this: The <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722305(v=ws.10).aspx">Emulate­Old­Path­Is­UNC</a> compatibility shim returns the <code>Path­Is­UNC</code> function to its old behavior that is bug-for-bug compatible with Windows XP. </p>
