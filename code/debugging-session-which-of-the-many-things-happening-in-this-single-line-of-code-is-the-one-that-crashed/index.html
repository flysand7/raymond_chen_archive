<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Debugging session: Which of the many things happening in this single line of code is the one that crashed?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A crash report came in, and the offending line of code was the following: </p>
<pre>
void CDeloreanSettings::UpdateFluxModulation(bool sendNotification)
{
    ComPtr&lt;IFluxModulator&gt; spModulator;
    // Crash on the next line
    if (SUCCEEDED(m_spFluxCapacitor-&gt;GetFluxModulator(&amp;spModulator)))
    {
        ...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Someone made the initial diagnosis that </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>The call is to <code>Release­And­Get­Address­Of()</code> on a <code>ComPtr</code> object which is declared right above (which should be initialized to <code>nullptr</code>). Am I missing something? </p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at the disassembly. First, with no annotations. See if you can figure it out yourself. </p>

; ReleaseAndGetAddressOf was inlined. Here's the Release part:

; prepare m_spFluxCapacitor-&gt;...

</pre>
<p>The compiler inlined <code>Release­And­Get­Address­Of</code>, and it interleaved various unrelated operations. In the second block of code, you can see it interleave the construction of the <code>Com­Ptr</code> with the call to <code>Internal­Release</code>. In the third block, you can see it peform the control flow guard test before performing the <code>Get­Addresss­Of</code>. </p>
<p>The conclusion, therefore, is not that the crash occurred in the <code>Release­And­Get­Address­Of</code> The <code>Release­And­Get­Address­Of</code> just finished releasing and is waiting for its turn to do the <code>Get­Addresss­Of</code>. Rather, the crash occurred because <code>m_spFlux­Capacitor</code> is null, and we crashes trying to read the vtable from a null pointer. </p>
<p>Further investigation of the issue revealed that <code>Update­Flux­Modulation</code> is called from an event handler that was registered to be called whenever the modulation changed. Inspection of memory showed that the event registration token was zero, indicating that the event has already been unregistered. The issue is that there was a modulation change in flight when the event handler was unregistered, so the <code>CDelorean­Settings</code> received its change notification after it had unregistered. The fix is to have the handler check whether it still has a <code>m_spFlux­Capacitor</code>, and if not, then ignore the notification, on the assumption that it was a stray notification that was late to arrive. </p>
