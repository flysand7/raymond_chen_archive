<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does RegOpenKey sometimes (but not always) fail if I use two backslashes instead of one?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported that on Windows XP, they observed that
their program would very rarely get the error
<code>ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT</code> when they passed
two backslashes instead of one to the
<code>Reg­Open­Key­Ex</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
RegOpenKeyEx(hk, L"Blah<font color="red">\\\\</font>Oops", ...);
</pre>
<p>
After removing C++ escapes, the resulting string passed to
<code>Reg­Open­Key­Ex</code> is
</p>
<pre>
Blah<font color="red">\\</font>Oops
</pre>
<p>
The failure was very sporadic and not reproducible under
controlled conditions.
</p>
<p>
Well, first of all, doubled backslashes are not legal in
registry key paths in the first place,
so the first recommendation is <i>stop doubling the backslashes</i>.
Once you fix that, the problem will go away.
</p>
<p>
But the next question is why the error was detected sometimes
but not always.
</p>
<p>
When an application tries to open a registry key, the registry
code first consults a cache of recently-opened keys,
since registry accesses exhibit very high locality of reference.
If a match is found in the cache, then the cached result is used.
Otherwise, it’s a cache miss,
and the registry tree is searched in the old-fashioned way.
The registry tree search rejects the double-backslash since it
interprets the path
<code>Blah\\Oops</code> as
“Look for a subkey called <code>"Blah"</code>,
then a subkey called <code>""</code>,
then a subkey called <code>"Oops"</code>.”
The “subkey called <code>""</code>” step fails
because key cannot have an empty string as their name.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the code that checks the cache
has a different search algorithm which
happens to have the effect of
collapsing consecutive
backslashes, so the path
<code>Blah\\Oops</code> is interpreted as
“Look for a subkey called <code>"Blah"</code>,
then a subkey called <code>"Oops"</code>.”
(Note: “has the effect of”. There is no explicit
“collapse backslashes” step; it just turns out that the
way the path is parsed, consecutive backslashes end up
being treated as if they were single backslashes.)
</p>
<p>
In the customer’s case, therefore, the key in question is
in the cache most of the time,
which is why the doubled backslash is silently corrected to a
single backslash.
But every so often, the key is not in the cache,
and the old-fashioned search is performed.
And the old-fashioned search rejects the double-backslash
as an invalid path.
</p>
<p>
The discrepancy in the two parsing algorithms
was resolved in Windows Vista,
so you’ll see this issue only on Windows XP and earlier.
</p>
<p>
But this historical tidbit does highlight one of the hidden
gotchas of optimization:
If your optimized version
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/08/31/10345196.aspx">
differs from the unoptimized version</a>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/29/10217910.aspx">
in cases that are theoretically anyway illegal</a>,
you may find yourself chasing elusive bugs
when somebody accidentally stumbles into those cases
and managed to get away with it… until now.</p>
