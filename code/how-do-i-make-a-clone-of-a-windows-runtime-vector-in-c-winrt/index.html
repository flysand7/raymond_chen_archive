<p>Suppose you have a Windows Runtime vector, either an <code>IVector&lt;T&gt;</code> or an <code>IVector­View&lt;T&gt;</code>, and you want to clone it so that you can operate on the clone without affecting the original. For example, maybe you have an <code>IVector­View&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is read-only, and you want to clone it so you can make changes.</p>
<p>The naïve way would be to copy the vector:</p>
<pre>// Code in italics is wrong.
IVector&lt;Thing&gt; original = GetTheThings();
<i>IVector&lt;Thing&gt; clone = IVector&lt;Thing&gt;{ original };</i>
</pre>
<p>This doesn’t work because <code>IVector&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>IVector­View&lt;T&gt;</code> are interfaces, and copying an interface merely copies a reference to the same underlying object.</p>
<p>To get a brand new object, you need to create a brand new object.</p>
<pre>IVector&lt;Thing&gt; original = GetTheThings();
std::vector&lt;Thing&gt; temp{ original.Size() };
original.GetMany(0, temp);
IVector&lt;Thing&gt; clone = single_threaded_vector(std::move(temp));
</pre>
<p>First, we create a temporary vector into which we will copy the contents of the original vector.</p>
<p>Next, we use the <code>Get­Many</code> method to read the entire contents of the original <code>IVector</code> into our temporary vector. Note that if the vector’s size can change asynchronously, then there’s a race condition if the size changes between the time we create the temporary vector and the time we fill it with goodies. Fixing that is left as en exercise.</p>
<p>Finally, we create a brand new <code>IVector</code> from our temporary vector.</p>
