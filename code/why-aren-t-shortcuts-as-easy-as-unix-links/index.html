<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why aren't shortcuts as easy as unix links?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter dingo asks, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#439796">Why are shortcuts so hard to manipulate?</a> Why can’t they be as easy as unix links?”
 Well, if you want something like unix links, then you can just create a hard link. Creating them is about the same difficulty (<code>CreateHardLink</code> vs <code>link</code>) and manipulating them is the same since you don’t actually manipulate a hard link. You just use it like a regular file (since a regular file <i>is</i> a hard link).
 If you want something like unix symbolic links, then you can create an NTFS junction, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/27/332704.aspx"> such as this one that mounts a drive into a directory</a>. (I’m told that Windows Vista expands the repertoire of symbolic links as well.)</p>
<p> But neither of these features is available on FAT (or CD-ROMs or Novell Netware or email), which meant that Windows 95 couldn’t use them. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/09/WindowsConfidential/"> Last year I discussed in some detail why shortcuts are files</a>. Maybe that’s what your question is really about. </p>
