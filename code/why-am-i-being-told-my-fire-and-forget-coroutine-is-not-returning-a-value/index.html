<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why am I being told my fire_and_forget coroutine is not returning a value?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You’re writing a C++/WinRT coroutine that nominally returns a <code>fire_<wbr/>and_<wbr/>forget</code>, meaning that the coroutine runs without notifying anybody when it is finished.</p>
<pre>fire_and_forget DoSomething()
{ 
    DoFirstThing();
    DoSecondThing();
}
</pre>
<p>And when you compile this, you get</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">error C4716: 'DoSomething': must return a value
</pre>
<p>A <code>fire_and_forget</code> coroutine doesn’t have a return value, since there is nobody awaiting it. So what’s going on here?</p>
<p>What’s going on is that the body of your <code>fire_and_forget</code> coroutine doesn’t contain any <code>co_await</code> or <code>co_return</code> statements. A function must contain at least one <code>co_await</code> or <code>co_return</code> statement in order to be considered a coroutine. Since the function did neither of those things, the C++ language treats it not as a coroutine but a regular function.</p>
<p>A regular function that needs to return a <code>fire_<wbr/>and_<wbr/>forget</code> object, and you didn’t do that.</p>
<p>You have a few options for fixing this.</p>
<p>One option is to add a <code>co_return;</code> statement at the end. Normally, falling off the end of a coroutine is equivalent to performing a <code>co_return;</code>, but in this case, you need to say <code>co_return</code> explicitly in order to make sure you have a coroutine at all!</p>
<p>Another option is to change your function to return <code>void</code>. After all, it doesn’t contain any asynchronous operations, so the whole thing ran synchronously anyway. It never needed to be a coroutine in the first place.</p>
