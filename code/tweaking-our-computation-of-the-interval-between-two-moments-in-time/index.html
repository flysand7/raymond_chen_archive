<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Tweaking our computation of the interval between two moments in time</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We can take our
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/14/408106.aspx">
computation of the interval between two moments in time</a>
and combine it with the trick we developed for
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/13/407835.aspx">
using the powers of mathematics to simplify multi-level comparisons</a>
to reduce the amount of work we impose upon the time/date engine.
</p>
<pre>
static void PrintAge(DateTime bday, DateTime asof)
{
 // Accumulate years without going over.
 int years = asof.Year - bday.Year;
<font color="blue"> if (asof.Month*32 + asof.Day &lt; bday.Month*32 + bday.Day) years--;
 DateTime t = bday.AddYears(years);</font>
 // Accumulate months without going over.
 int months = asof.Month - bday.Month;
 if (asof.Day &lt; bday.Day) months--;
 months = (months + 12) % 12;
 t = t.AddMonths(months);
 // Days are constant-length, woo-hoo!
 int days = (asof - t).Days;
 SC.WriteLine("{0} years, {1} months, {2} days",
              years, months, days);
}
</pre>
<p>
Observe that we avoided a call to the <code>AddYears</code> method
(which is presumably rather complicated because years are variable-length)
by replacing it with a multi-level comparison
to determine whether the ending month/day falls later in the year than
the starting month/day.  Since no month has 32 days, a multiplier of
32 is enough to avoid an overflow of the day into the month field
of the comparison key.</p>
