<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Zeroing out my memory does cause them to page in faster after all</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Not too long ago, I answered the question “If I zero out my memory pages, does that make them page in faster?” with “<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">No</a>.” </p>
<p>Turns out that I was working from outdated information. </p>
<p>My former colleague Adrian Oney (who, among other things, has shared with us the story of the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/#comment-198323">USB Cart of Death</a>) confirms the information in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn613877.aspx">the white paper shared by commenter John Doe</a>, namely that starting in Windows Vista, the memory manager does check whether a page that is about to paged out consists entirely of zeroes. If so, then the memory manager turns the page into a demand-zero page rather than a page stored in the pagefile (that happens to contain nothing but zeroes). </p>
<p>Adrian <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/#comment-1264885">said</a> that he wrote the original prototype which confirmed that the extra check was worth it. “Some of this was due to apps dirtying their zero-init pages with inits to zero. Some of it was due to user mode zeroing pages for security reasons. But it was common enough to make it worthwhile.” </p>
<p>I suspect that the increasing use of virtualization may contribute to this virtuous cycle as well. If the app is running in a virtual machine, then it’s a big win to avoid having to perform virtualized I/O. </p>
