<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the system convert TEMP to a short file name?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you set environment variables with the System control panel, the <code>TEMP</code> and <code>TMP</code> variables are silently converted to their short file name equivalents (if possible). Why is that?</p>
<p> For compatibility, of course. </p>
<p> It is very common for <a href="http://www.fpschultze.de/b6.htm">batch files</a> to <a href="http://www.robvanderwoude.com/userinput.html"> assume that</a> the paths referred to by the <code>%TEMP%</code> and <code>%TMP%</code> environment variables <a href="http://www.madirish.net/tech.php?article=124&amp;section=10"> do not contain any embedded spaces</a>. (Other programs may also make this assumption, but batch files are the most common place where you run into this problem.) </p>
<p> I say “if possible” because <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/all/deployguide/en-us/28231.asp"> you can disable short name generation</a>, in which case there is no short name equivalent, and the path remains in its original long form. </p>
<p> If you are crazy enough to set this value and point your <code>TEMP</code>/<code>TMP</code> variables at a directory whose name contains spaces and doesn’t have a short name, then you get to see what sorts of things stop working properly.  Don’t say I didn’t warn you. </p>
