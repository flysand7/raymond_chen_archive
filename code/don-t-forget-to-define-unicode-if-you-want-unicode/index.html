<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don't forget to #define UNICODE if you want Unicode</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I answered  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/23/118893.aspx#144621">  this comment</a> directly, but it deserves reiteration with wider  visibility.
  If you don’t #define UNICODE, you get ANSI by default.
  If you want to see characters beyond the boring 7-bit ASCII,  make sure you are using a font that can display those characters.
  I am assuming a level of competence where issues like this  go without saying, so that I can dig into the more advanced topics  without having to explain all the basics, but I have to accept that  people of all levels of programming experience read my stuff.</p>
<p>  But the second part raises an advanced question:  How do you find a font that  can display the characters you want? What if the characters can come  from a source outside your control?  We’ll look at this tomorrow.  </p>
