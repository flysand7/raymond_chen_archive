<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If FlushInstructionCache doesn’t do anything, why do you have to call it, revisited</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You are supposed to call the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function when you generate or modify code at runtime, so that when the CPU tries to execute the newly-generated or newly-modified modified code, it will read the instructions you wrote, rather than any instructions that may be hanging around in the instruction cache.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we saw that on Windows 95, the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function didn’t do anything aside from returning. That’s because <a href="/history/if-flushinstructioncache-doesn-t-do-anything-why-do-you-have-to-call-it"> the mere act of calling a function was sufficient to flush the instruction cache</a>.</p>
<p>On Windows NT, however, the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function does actual work, since it needs to notify all the other processors of the need to flush their instruction caches, too.</p>
<p>But if you look at Windows 10, you may find that the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function looks like the Windows 95 version: It doesn’t do anything.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<p>Whether the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function “does anything” depends on which processor you’re using. Some processors have an integrated data and instruction cache, in which case the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function doesn’t need to do anything. Others such as ARM still have separate instruction and data caches, and in those cases, flushing does real work. Whether the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function “does anything” depends on the processor architecture it was compiled for.</p>
<p>As a programmer, you should just call the <code>Flush­Instruction­Cache</code> function and let the operating system figure out whether flushing will actually need to “do anything”.</p>
