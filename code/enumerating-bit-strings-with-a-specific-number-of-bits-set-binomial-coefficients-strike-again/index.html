<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Enumerating bit strings with a specific number of bits set (binomial coefficients strike again)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program prints all bit strings of length <var>n</var>
subject to the requirement that the string have exactly <var>k</var>
1-bits.
For example, all bit strings of length 4 with 2 bits set are
0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, and 1100.
Let’s write
BitString(<var>n</var>, <var>k</var>) to mean all the bit strings
of length <var>n</var> with exactly <var>k</var> bits set.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at the last bit of a typical member of
BitString(<var>n</var>, <var>k</var>).
If it is a zero, then removing it leaves a string one bit shorter
but with the same number of bits set.
Conversely every BitString(<var>n</var> − 1, <var>k</var>) string
can be extended to a BitString(<var>n</var>, <var>k</var>) string
by adding a zero to the end.
</p>
<p>
If the last bit is a one, then
removing it leaves a bit string of
length <var>n</var> − 1 with exactly <var>k</var> − 1 bits set,
and conversely every bit string of length <var>n</var> − 1 with
exactly <var>k</var> − 1 bits set can be extended to a bit string of
length <var>n</var> with exactly <var>k</var> bits set by adding a one to the end.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, our algorithm goes like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle base cases.
<li>Otherwise,
<ul>
<li>Recursively call
    BitString(<var>n</var> − 1,
    <var>k</var>) and add a 0 to the end.
<li>Recursively call
    BitString(<var>n</var> − 1,
    <var>k</var> − 1) and add
    a 1 to the end.
</li></li></ul>
</li></li></ul>
<p>
This algorithm may look awfully familiar.
The overall recursive structure is the same as
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/04/14/10516909.aspx">
enumerating subsets with binomial coefficients</a>;
we just decorate the results differently.
</p>
<p>
That’s because this problem is the same as the problem of
enumerating subsets.
You can think of the set bits as selecting which elements
get put into the subset.
</p>
<p>
It’s not surprising, therefore, that the resulting code
is identical except for how we report the results.
(Instead of generating arrays, we generate strings.)
</p>
<pre>
function repeatString(s, n) {
 return new Array(n+1).join(s);
}
function BitString(n, k, f) {
 if (k == 0) { f(repeatString("0", n)); return; }
 if (n == 0) { return; }
 BitString(n-1, k, function(s) { f(s + "0"); });
 BitString(n-1, k-1, function(s) { f(s + "1"); });
}
</pre>
<p>
If <code>k</code> is zero, then that means we are looking
for strings of length <code>n</code>
that contain no bits set at all.
There is exactly one of those, namely the string consisting
of <code>n</code> zeroes.
</p>
<p>
If <code>k</code> is nonzero but <code>n</code> is zero,
then that means we want strings of length zero with some bits set.
That's not possible, so we return without generating anything.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we handle the recursive case by generating the shorter
strings and tacking on the appropriate digits.
</p>
<p>
Since this is the same algorithm as subset generation,
we should be able to write one in terms of the other:
</p>
<pre>
function BitString(n, k, f) {
 Subsets(n, k, function(s) {
  var str = "";
  for (var i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
   str += s.indexOf(i) &gt;= 0 ? "1" : "0";
  }
  f(str);
 });
}
</pre>
