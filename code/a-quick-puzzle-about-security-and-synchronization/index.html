<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A quick puzzle about security and synchronization</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
This quick puzzle floated past one of our internal discussion groups.
</p>
<pre>
// in process A
hEventA = CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE, TRUE, TEXT("MyNamedEvent"));
// in process B
hEventB = OpenEvent(EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, FALSE, TEXT("MyNamedEvent"));
WaitForSingleObject(hEventB, INFINITE);
</pre>
<p>
In Process B, the <code>OpenEvent</code> succeeds, but the
<code>WaitForSingleObject</code> returns immediately instead of
waiting.  Explain.
</p>
<p>
[Correction: I confused the matter by passing <code>TRUE</code> as
the third parameter, thereby creating an event that is initially
signalled.  Change it to <code>FALSE</code> so that the event
is created non-signalled, in which case the
<code>WaitForSingleObject</code> would be expected to wait.]</p>
