<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I make a dialog box right-to-left at runtime?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
A customer had a program that decided at runtime
what language to use for its user interface.
The customer was having trouble getting the program’s
dialog boxes to show up with right-to-left layout
when necessary.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We are setting the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT­RTL</code>
extended style in the dialog box’s
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT­DIALOG</code> message handler,
but
what we’re seeing is
that although the style applies successfully,
and the dialog itself renders RTL,
its child elements don’t.
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
The actual screen shot provided by the customer
involved Arabic text, but I used English text so you
can see which parts are running left-to-right and
which parts are right-to-left.
Also, because I don’t know Arabic.
</p>
<p>
The title bar is running right-to-left, as desired,
but the contents of the dialog are still left-to-right.
What’s going on?
</p>
<p>
As I’ve noted before,
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100611-00/?p=13743">
the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT­RTL</code>
extended style
is inherited by child windows</a>
(unless blocked by the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>NO­INHERIT­LAYOUT</code>
extended style).
What I didn’t call out is that this inheritance occurs at the
point the child window is created.
The child window takes a snapshot of its parent window’s
layout;
future changes to the parent window’s layout have no effect.
</p>
<p>
The next piece of the puzzle is realizing that the
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT­DIALOG</code> message
is sent after the child windows have been created.
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050331-00/?p=36003">
I called this out explicitly in an earlier discussion of dialog boxes</a>,
but you already know this,
because your
<code>WM_</code><code>INIT­DIALOG</code> message handler
calls
<code>Get­Dlg­Item</code> to obtain handles to dialog
child windows in order to initialize and configure them.
</p>
<p>
So you need to get the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT­RTL</code>
onto the window before child windows are created.
One way of doing this is to edit the dialog template
and add (or remove) the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>LAYOUT­RTL</code>
extended style
from the
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040623-00/?p=38753">
<code>dwExStyle</code> member of the 32-bit extended header</a>
before you call
<code>Create­Dialog­Indirect</code> or one of its relatives.
