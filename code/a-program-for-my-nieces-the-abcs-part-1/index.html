<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A program for my nieces: The ABCs, part 1</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
I’m going to spend the next few weeks developing a Little Program
in several parts.
This is a program I wrote for my nieces,
who always wanted to play with my laptop
(instead of playing with <i>me</i>).
</p>
<p>
Initially, I fired up Notepad and maximized it,
and cranked the font size,
but that became cumbersome, because I had to reset
the font size and Word Wrap setting when they were done.
On top of that, my eldest niece complained that some
of the the letters were “wrong”:
The shape of the capital J in the font that I use
does not match the shape of the capital J that my niece
was taught.
(The top serif didn’t match.)
</p>
<p>
Having to change the font and then reset it was enough
to make me decide to write my own program for my nieces
to play with.
I started with
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
the scratch program</a>
and made these changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">HFONT g_hfEdit;
#define MARGIN 20</font>
void
OnSize(HWND hwnd, UINT state, int cx, int cy)
{
  if (g_hwndChild) {
    MoveWindow(g_hwndChild,
               <font color="blue">MARGIN</font>, <font color="blue">MARGIN</font>,
               cx <font color="blue">- 2 * MARGIN</font>,
               cy <font color="blue">- 2 * MARGIN</font>, TRUE);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>MARGIN</code> puts a little space around the edit control
so it doesn’t jam up against the edges of the screen.
</p>
<pre>
void
On<font color="blue">Nc</font>Destroy(HWND hwnd)
{
    <font color="blue">if (g_hfEdit) DeleteObject(g_hfEdit);</font>
    PostQuitMessage(0);
}
    // <font color="red"><strike>HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_DESTROY, OnDestroy);</strike></font>
    <font color="blue">HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NCDESTROY, OnNcDestroy);</font>
</pre>
<p>
The cleanup of the font is done in the
<code>WM_NC­DESTROY</code> handler
because that runs
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/26/443384.aspx">
after the child windows have been destroyed</a>.
That way, we don’t destroy a font while the edit
control is still using it.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font color="blue">g_hfEdit = CreateFont(-72, 0, 0, 0, FW_NORMAL,
                        FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, DEFAULT_CHARSET,
                        OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
                        CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
                        DEFAULT_QUALITY,
                        DEFAULT_PITCH,
                        TEXT("Miriam"));
  if (!g_hfEdit) return FALSE;
  g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(
      TEXT("edit"),                   /* Class Name */
      NULL,                           /* Title */
      WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE |
      ES_UPPERCASE | ES_MULTILINE,    /* Style */
      0, 0, 0, 0,                     /* Position and size */
      hwnd,                           /* Parent */
      NULL,                           /* No menu */
      g_hinst,                        /* Instance */
      0);                             /* No special parameters */
  if (!g_hwndChild) return FALSE;
  SetWindowFont(g_hwndChild, g_hfEdit, TRUE);</font>
  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
When our main window is created,
we create our helper edit control.
It is a multi-line edit control
without any scroll bars
that forces its contents to uppercase,
since they haven’t learned lowercase letters yet.
</p>
<p>
My program doesn’t do any painting, so I deleted the
<code>WM_PAINT</code>
and
<code>WM_PRINT­CLIENT</code> handlers.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
it needs to transfer focus to the edit control,
so that switching to the application puts you in typing mode
immediately:
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">void OnSetFocus(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndOldFocus)
{
  if (g_hwndChild) {
    SetFocus(g_hwndChild);
  }
}
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_SETFOCUS, OnSetFocus);</font>
</pre>
<p>
Finally, I create the window as a fullscreen popup,
so that all my nieces get is a clean screen with no
window chrome.
(I was using the new Microsoft design language before it was cool.)
</p>
<pre>
    hwnd = CreateWindow(
        TEXT("Scratch"),                /* Class Name */
        <font color="blue">TEXT("ABC"),                    /* Title */
        <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/05/414910.aspx">WS_POPUP</a>,                       /* Style */
        0, 0,                           /* Position */
        GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN),
        GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN),</font>  /* Size */
        NULL,                           /* Parent */
        NULL,                           /* No menu */
        hinst,                          /* Instance */
        0);                             /* No special parameters */
</pre>
<p>
And there we have it.
A simple program with an edit control
that my nieces can use for typing.
</p>
<p>
They call this program
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/25/10053862.aspx">
<i>ABC</i></a>.
Now when I go over to their house,
they ask,
“Can I play ABC?”
</p>
<p>
This program served well for a first pass,
but my nieces naturally discovered problems with it.
We’ll look at them in future weeks.
</p>
<p>
Remember, since this is a Little Program,
I’m skipping a lot of error checking,
and I’m assuming that the system has only one monitor
(because it runs on my laptop).</p>
