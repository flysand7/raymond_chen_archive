<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why double-null-terminated strings instead of an array of pointers to strings?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I mentioned this in passing in my description of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/08/9904646.aspx"> the format of double-null-terminated strings</a>, but I think it deserves calling out.
 Double-null-terminated strings may be difficult to create and modify, but they are very easy to serialize: You just write out the bytes as a blob. This property is very convenient when you have to copy around the list of strings: Transferring the strings is a simple matter of transferring the memory block as-is. No conversion is necessary. This makes it easy to do things like wrap the memory inside another container that supports only flat blobs of memory.
 As it turns out, a flat blob of memory is convenient in many ways. You can copy it around with memcpy. (This is important when capturing values across security boundaries.) You can save it to a file or into the registry as-is. It marshals very easily. It becomes possible to store it in an <code>IData­Object</code>. It can be freed with a single call. And in the cases where you can’t allocate any memory at all (<i>e.g.</i>, you’re filling a buffer provided by the caller), it’s one of the few options available. This is also why <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/aa374807.aspx"> self-relative security descriptors</a> are so popular in Windows: Unlike absolute security descriptors, self-relative security descriptors can be passed around as binary blobs, which makes them easy to marshal, especially if you need to pass one from kernel mode to user mode.
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/08/9904646.aspx#9905474"> A single memory block with an array of integers containing offsets would also work</a>, but as the commenter noted, it’s even more cumbersome than double-null-terminated strings.</p>
<p> Mind you, if you don’t need to marshal the list of strings (because it never crosses a security boundary and never needs to be serialized), then an array of string pointers works just fine. If you look around Win32, you’ll find that most cases where double-null terminated strings exist are for the most part either inherited from 16-bit Windows or are one of the cases where marshalling is necessary. </p>
