<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to set focus in a dialog box</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Setting focus in a dialog box is more than just calling
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardinput/keyboardinputreference/keyboardinputfunctions/setfocus.asp">
SetFocus</a>.
</p>
<p>A dialog box maintains the concept of a “default button”
(which is always a pushbutton).
The default button is typically drawn with a distinctive look
(a heavy outline or a different color) and indicates what action
the dialog box will take when you hit Enter.
Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as the control
that has the focus.
</p>
<p>
For example, open the Run dialog from the Start menu.
Observe that the OK button is the default button;
it has a different look from the other buttons.
But focus is on the edit control.
Your typing goes to the edit control, until you hit Enter; the
Enter activates the default button, which is OK.
</p>
<p>
As you tab through the dialog, observe what happens to the default
button.  When the dialog box moves focus
to a pushbutton, that pushbutton becomes
the new default button.
But when the dialog box moves focus
to something that isn’t a pushbutton at all,
the OK button resumes its position as the default button.
</p>
<p>
The dialog manager remebers which control was the default button
when the dialog was initially created, and when it moves focus
to something that isn’t a button, it restores that original button
as the default button.
</p>
<p>
You can ask a dialog box what the default button is by sending
it
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/DialogBoxReference/DialogBoxMessages/DM_GETDEFID.asp">
the DM_GETDEFID message</a>;
similarly, you can change it with
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/DialogBoxReference/DialogBoxMessages/DM_SETDEFID.asp">
the DM_SETDEFID message</a>.
</p>
<p>
(Notice that the return value of the DM_GETDEFID message packs the
control ID in the low word and flags in the high word.
Another place where expanding dialog control IDs to 32-bit values
doesn’t buy you anything.)
</p>
<p>
As the remarks to the DM_SETDEFID function note, messing directly
with the default ID carelessly can lead to odd cases like a dialog box
with two default buttons.
Fortunately, you rarely need to change the default ID for a dialog.
</p>
<p>
A bigger problem is using SetFocus to shove focus around a dialog.
If you do this, you are going directly to the window manager,
bypassing the dialog manager.  This means that you can create
“impossible” situations like having focus on a pushbutton without
that button being the default!
</p>
<p>
To avoid this problem, don’t use SetFocus to change focus on a dialog.
Instead, use
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/DialogBoxReference/DialogBoxMessages/WM_NEXTDLGCTL.asp">
the WM_NEXTDLGCTL message</a>.
</p>
<pre>
void SetDialogFocus(HWND hdlg, HWND hwndControl)
{
 SendMessage(hdlg, WM_NEXTDLGCTL, (WPARAM)hwndControl, TRUE);
}
</pre>
<p>
As the remarks for the WM_NEXTDLGCTL message observe,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/DialogBoxReference/DialogBoxFunctions/DefDlgProc.asp">
the DefDlgProc function</a> handles the WM_NEXTDLGCTL message
by updating all the internal dialog manager bookkeeping,
deciding which button should be default, all that good stuff.
</p>
<p>
Now you can update dialog boxes like the professionals,
avoiding oddities like having no default button, or worse,
multiple default buttons!</p>
