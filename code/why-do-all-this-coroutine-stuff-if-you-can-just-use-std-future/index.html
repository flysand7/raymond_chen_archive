<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do all this coroutine stuff if you can just use <code>std::future</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues reacted to <a href="/code/a-map-through-the-three-major-coroutine-series"> my series on creating custom coroutines</a> by asking, “Why did you bother with this <code>simple_task</code> custom coroutine? Why not just use <code>std::future</code> objects produced by <code>std::async</code>? You can <code>co_await</code> a <code>std::future</code>.”</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, the ability to <code>co_await</code> a <code>std::future</code> is not a feature of the standard (as of this writing). It’s something that the Microsoft STL provides as a courtesy. And that courtesy has <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200916-00/?p=104227"> not always been smooth sailing</a>.</p>
<p>For another thing, <code>std::async</code> lets you pick how the lambda runs, but your only options are to run it on a separate thread, or to run the lambda only when the value is awaited. The lambda itself can’t do any <code>co_await</code>ing because it is not a coroutine. It’s just a plain synchronous lambda.</p>
<p>But the real kicker is that the Microsoft STL implementation of <code>std::future</code> is written in… PPL, The very library we are trying to get rid of by switching to coroutines in the first place.</p>
<p>That last bit was the clincher as far as my colleague was concerned. He sent me the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/fzmn27/always_has_been/"> astronaut with a gun meme</a>, but instead of asking, “Wait, it’s all Ohio?”, the first astronaut asks, “std::future is just PPL?” The reply from the astronaut with the gun remains “Always has been.”</p>
