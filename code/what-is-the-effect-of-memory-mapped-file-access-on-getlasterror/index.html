<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the effect of memory-mapped file access on GetLastError()?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer was using memory-mapped files and was looking for
information as to whether access to the memory-mapped data
modifies the value returned by
<code>Get­Last­Error</code>.
A member of the kernel team replied,
“No, memory-mapped I/O does not ever change the value returned by
<code>Get­Last­Error</code>.”
</p>
<p>
That answer is simultaneously correct and wrong,
a case of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/12/10163578.aspx">
looking at the world through kernel-colored glasses</a>.
</p>
<p>
While it’s true that the kernel does not ever change the value
returned by
<code>Get­Last­Error</code>,
it’s also the case that
<i>you</i> might change it.
</p>
<p>
If you set up an exception handler, then your
exception handler might perform operations that affect
the last-error code, and those changes will be visible
after the exception handler returns.
(This applies to all exception handlers and filters,
not just ones related to memory-mapped files.)
</p>
<p>
If you intend to return
<code>EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION</code>
because you handled the exception,
then you probably should make sure to leave the last-error
code the way you found it.
Otherwise, the code that you interrupted and then resumed will have had its
last-error code changed asynchronously.
You just

sabotaged it from above</a>.

<i>// Code in italics is wrong
LONG ExceptionFilter(LPEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers)
{
 if (IsAnExceptionICanRepair(ExceptionPointers)) {
   RepairException(ExceptionPointers);
   // fixed up error; continuing
   return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
 }
 if (IsAnExceptionICanHandle(ExceptionPointers)) {
  // We cannot repair it, but we can handle it.
  return EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER;
 }
 // Not our exception. Keep looking.
 return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
If the <code>Is­An­Exception­I­Can­Repair</code> function
or
<code>Repair­Exception</code> function
does anything that affects the last-error code,
then when the exception filter is executed for a repairable
exception, the last-error code is magically changed without the
mainline code’s knowledge.
All the mainline code did was execute stuff normally, and somehow
during a memory access or a floating point operation or some other
seemingly-harmless action, the last-error code spontaneously changed!
</p>
<p>
If you are going to continue execution at the point the exception was
raised, then you need to “put things back the way you found them”
(except of course for the part where you repair the exception itself).

<b>Exercise</b>:
Why isn’t it important to restore the last error code if
you return <code>EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER</code>?
