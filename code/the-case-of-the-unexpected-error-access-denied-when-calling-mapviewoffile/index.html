<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the unexpected ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED when calling MapViewOfFile</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was trying to figure out how to use shared memory, but even their simplest program couldn’t work. The customer shared their code and asked for help. </p>
<p>The first process creates a named file mapping object backed by the page file. The second process opens the file mapping object by name, and then maps a view of that file mapping object. But the attempt to map the view always fails with <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code>. The file mapping object was created by the first process as read/write, and it was opened by the second process as read/write. The two processes are running in the same session as the same user. And yet, the second process can’t get access. What’s wrong? </p>
<p>To simplify presentation, error checking has been deleted. Instead, we will describe what happened with comments. </p>

<p>The customer added that the second process successfully opened the file mapping object, so presumably the handle does have read/write access. Otherwise, the <code>Open­File­Mapping</code> would have failed with <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code> right away, rather than waiting for the <code>Map­View­Of­File</code>. </p>
<p>Study these programs and see if you can find the problem. </p>
<p>(Time passes.) </p>
<p>The problem is that the first parameter to <code>Open­File­Mapping</code> is not supposed to be a <code>PAGE_*</code> value. It’s supposed to be a <code>FILE_MAP_*</code> value. This is easily overlooked because you are tempted to just do a copy/paste of the <code>Create­File­Mapping</code> call’s parameters, and just delete the parameters related specifically to creation, like file size and security descriptor. </p>
<p>However, it is a common¹ pattern that <code>Create</code> functions return a handle with full access and do not have an explicit access mask parameter, whereas <code>Open</code> functions accept an access mask parameter that controls what level of access the returned handle has. </p>
<p>The numeric value of <code>PAGE_READ­WRITE</code> is 4, which happens to match the numeric value of <code>FILE_MAP_READ</code>. Therefore, the second program successfully opened the file mapping for read, but when it tried to map it for read and write, it got <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code> because it’s trying to obtain a mapping for writing, even though the mapping was opened only for read. </p>
<p>This is one of the nasty pitfalls of using plain old integers for flags. There’s no type safety: Integers look the same. </p>
<p>¹ Note that the pattern is common but not not universal. The most notable exception is <code>Create­File</code>, which takes an explicit access mask. But if you think about it some more, <code>Create­File</code> is an open-like function, because if the file already exists, <code>Create­File</code> opens a handle to it, and it uses the requested access mask to evaluate whether your attempt to open that handle will succeed. </p>
