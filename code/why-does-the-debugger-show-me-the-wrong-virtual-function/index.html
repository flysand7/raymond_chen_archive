<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the debugger show me the wrong virtual function?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Pointers to virtual functions all look basically the same
and therefore,
<a href="/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/22/400373.aspx">
as we learned last time</a>,
all end up merged
into a single function.
Here’s a contrived example:
</p>
<pre>
class Class1
{
public:
 virtual int f1() { return 0; }
 virtual int f2() { return 1; }
};
class Class2
{
public:
 virtual int g1() { return 2; }
 virtual int g2() { return 3; }
};
int (Class1::*pfn1)() = Class1::f2;
int (Class2::*pfn2)() = Class2::g2;
</pre>
<p>
If you take a look at <code>pfn1</code> and <code>pfn2</code>
you’ll see that the point to the same function:
</p>
<pre>
0:000&gt; dd pfn1 l1
01002000  010010c8
0:000&gt; dd pfn2 l1
01002004  010010c8
0:000&gt; u 10010c8 l2
010010c8 8b01     mov     eax,[ecx]           ; first vtable
010010ca ff6004   jmp     dword ptr [eax+0x4] ; second function
</pre>
<p>
That’s because the virtual functions <code>Class1::f2</code> and
<code>Class2::g2</code> are both stored in the same location
relative to the respective object pointer:
They are the second entry in the first vtable.
Therefore, the code to call those functions is identical
and consequently has been merged by the linker.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the function pointers are not direct pointers to
the concrete implementations of <code>Class1::f2</code> and
<code>Class2::g2</code> because the function pointer might
be applied to a derived class which override the virtual
function:
</p>
<pre>
class Class3 : public Class1
{
public:
 virtual int f2() { return 9; }
};
Class3 c3;
(c3.*pfn1)(); // calls Class3::f2
</pre>
<p>
Applying the function pointer invokes the function on the derived class,
which is the whole point of declaring the function <code>Class1::f2</code>
as virtual in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Note that the C++ language explicitly states that the result of comparing
non-null pointers to virtual member functions is “unspecified”,
which is language-standards speak for “the result not only depends on
the implementation, but the implementation isn’t even required to
document how it arrives at the result.”</p>
