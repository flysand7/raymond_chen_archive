<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the point of the various …WhenCallbackReturns functions?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The thread pool provides a number of functions named <code>...When­Callback­Returns</code>. What’s the point of all these functions? Why can’t you just do the operation yourself immediately before returning?

<p> Basically, the same thing as <code>Free­Library­When­Callback­Returns</code>. It’s a way to release a resource after execution has left the function and the callback is marked as complete. In the case of a synchronization resource, that resource may be what’s keeping somebody from unloading your DLL, or it might protect a race condition between the callback function and a function that tries to cancel the callback. </p>
