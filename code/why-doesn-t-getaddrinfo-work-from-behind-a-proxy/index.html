<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn’t GetAddrInfo work from behind a proxy?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was having a problem with the <code>Get­Addr­Info</code> function when running inside a corporate proxy environment. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>We are trying to get the IP address of, say, www.microsoft.com by using the <code>Get­Addr­Info</code> function. This works fine if the computer is not behind a proxy, but if it is run in a corporate proxy environment, the call fails with <code>WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND</code>. </p></blockquote>
<p>The <code>Get­Addr­Info</code> function operates at a level below proxies. When you have a Web proxy, the computer never actually talks to www.microsoft.com directly. Instead, you connect to the proxy and tell the proxy, “Please contact www.microsoft.com for me, thanks.” That’s why it’s called a “proxy”. </p>
<p>You never see the IP address of www.microsoft.com; the only IP address you see is that of the proxy. Besides, since you are inside a corporate proxy environment, even if you had the IP address for www.microsoft.com, it is if no use to you since you cannot connect to it. </p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.isaserver.org/">products</a> that try to smooth over this boundary, so that programs think that they are connected directly to the Internet when in fact they are talking through the proxy. </p>
