<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/24/379635.aspx"> Earlier we saw the importance of setting the right owner window for modal UI</a>. It is also important, when manipulating a window, to respect its modality.  For example, consider the program we ended up with last time, the one which calls the <code>MessageBox</code> function to display a modal dialog. If we wanted to get that program to exit and sent a <code>WM_CLOSE</code> message to the main window instead of its modal popup, the main window would likely exit and leave the message box stranded, resulting in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/23/378866.aspx"> the same stack trace without support we saw in part 4</a>. </p>
<p> Respect the modality of a window. If it is disabled, don’t try to get it to do things; it’s disabled because it doesn’t want to do anything right now. You can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Windows/WindowReference/WindowFunctions/GetLastActivePopup.asp"> go hunting for its modal pop-up</a> and talk to that pop-up. (Unless, of course, that pop-up is itself disabled, in which case you get to keep on hunting.) </p>
