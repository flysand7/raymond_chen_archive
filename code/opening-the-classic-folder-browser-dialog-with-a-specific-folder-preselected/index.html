<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Opening the classic folder browser dialog with a specific folder preselected</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today’s Little Program shows how to set the initial selection in the <code>SHBrowse­For­Folder</code> dialog. </p>
<p>The design of the <code>SHBrowse­For­Folder</code> function had a defect: The <code>BROWSEINFO</code> structure doesn’t have a <code>cbSize</code> member at the start. This means that the structure cannot ever change because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/12/56061.aspx">the function would have no way of knowing whether you are calling with the old structure or the new one</a>. If it weren’t for this defect, setting the initial selection would have been easy: Add a <code>pidlInitialSelection</code> member to the structure and have people fill it in. </p>
<p>Alas, any new functionality in the <code>SHBrowse­For­Folder</code> function therefore requires that the new functionality be expressed within the constraints of the existing structure. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a callback that takes a message number. </p>
<p>The workaround, therefore, is to express any new functionalty in the form of new callback messages. </p>
<p>And that’s how the ability to set the initial selection in the folder browser dialog came about. A new message <code>BFFM_INITIALIZED</code> was created, and in handling that message, the callback can specify what it wants the selection to be. </p>

  SHGetPathFromIDList(pidl, szDisplayName);

 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>We initialize COM and then call the <code>SHBrowse­For­Folder</code> function with information that includes a callback. The callback responds to the <code>BFFM_INITIALIZED</code> message by changing the selection. </p>
<p>It’s not hard, but it’s a bit cumbersome. </p>
<p>Sorry. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The presence of the callback means that the function cannot <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/08/11/10548975.aspx#10549125">shunt the work to a new thread when called from an MTA thread</a> because you are now stuck with the problem of which thread the callback should run on. </p>
<ul>
<li>The callback may want to access resources     that belong to the original thread,     so that argues for the callback being run on the original thraed. 
<li>The callback may also want to access resources inside the dialog box,     say in order to customize it.     That argues for the callback being run on the new thread. </li></li></ul>
<p>You can’t have it both ways, so you’re stuck. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t really matter, because you <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/24/8420242.aspx">shouldn’t be performing UI from a multi-threaded apartment anyway</a>. There’s not much point in making it easier for people to do the wrong thing. </p>
