<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does SHGetKnownFolderPath return E_FAIL for a known folder?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported having problems with the
<code>SH­Get­Known­Folder­Path</code> function.
I’ve left in the red herrings.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
On Windows 7, I’m trying to retrieve the Internet folder
with the following code:
</p>
<pre>
if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY, hToken, &amp;pszPath);
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
The call always fails with <code>E_FAIL</code>.
What am I doing wrong?
I tried passing <code>NULL</code> as the token, but that didn’t help.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason the call fails has nothing to do with Windows 7
or the token.
The call fails because <code>FOLDERID_Internet­Folder</code> is
a virtual folder—there is no path in the first place!
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
The reason is that the folder you are requesting is a virtual
folder (KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL).
Virtual folders don’t exist in the file system, so they don’t have a path.
<code>SH­Get­Known­Folder­Item</code> should work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The customer appears to have misinterpreted this response
in a way I wasn’t expecting
(but which sadly
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/25/79842.aspx">
I’ve seen before</a>):
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I added the <code>KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL</code> flag, but I still
get the same error back.
</p>
<pre>
if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY | KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL,
                              hToken, &amp;pszPath);
 ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Um, no, that makes no sense at all.
<code>KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL</code>
is a <code>KF_CATEGORY</code>
value, but the second parameter to
<code>SH­GetKnown­Folder­Path</code>
is a <code>KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG</code>.
You can’t just combine unrelated values like that.
It’s like
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/03/147584.aspx">
adding 3 grams to 12 meters</a>.
</p>
<p>
And second, the <code>KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL</code> enumeration isn’t
something that you pass in to “override” anything.
The point is that <code>FOLDERID_Internet­Folder</code> is a virtual
folder: It has no path, so if you try to ask for its path, you’ll
just get an error back because the thing you’re looking for
simply doesn’t exist.
</p>

I never did figure out what this customer was trying to do.
Maybe they figured, since they can’t
<a href="http://notalwaysright.com/byte-off-more-than-you-can-chew/2372">
download the Internet</a>,
they could at least try to do a
<code>Find­First­File</code> on it.</p>
