<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't the TAB key work on controls I've marked as WS_TABSTOP?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer had a programming problem regarding tab stops:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I create a parent window (child of main frame) as below
</p>
<pre>
// Create the popup window that holds the toolbar.
if (!CreateEx(
        <b>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</b> | WS_EX_LAYERED,
        _T("ToolbarPopupWindow"),
        _T(""),
        WS_POPUP | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        pParentWnd-&gt;GetSafeHwnd(),
        NULL))
</pre>
<p>
This window hosts 2 toolbar windows.
Each toolbar window
has the <code>WS_TABSTOP</code> style set using
<code>SetWindowLong</code>.
</p>
<pre>
// Set tab stop for accessibility
DWORD dwStyles = ::GetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE);
::SetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE, dwStyles | WS_TABSTOP);
</pre>
<p>
MSDN states
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</b>
Allows the user to navigate among the child windows of the window
by using the TAB key.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But I am not able to use TAB to navigate to second toolbar.
I tried handling <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> and return
<code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code>. But this message is not sent to parent.
</p>
<p>
I can try subclassing the toolbar to handle TAB key, but if
I do that, then what’s the point of the <code>WS_TABSTOP</code>
and <code>WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</code> styles?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You already know how to solve this customer’s problem.
The quoted documentation comes
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/61fe4bte.aspx">
from the MFC documentation on extended window styles</a>.
You may find that
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632680.aspx">
the documentation in the Platform SDK to be a bit better</a>.
Which is not unexpected,
since extended window styles are a Platform SDK
feature; MFC is merely surfacing the underlying Win32 functionality
in its own framework.
</p>
<p>
Final clue:
Look at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/21/55384.aspx">
this old blog entry</a>,
but come to it with a different point of view.
</p>
<p>
I used my psychic powers to solve this one.
A close reading of the description of the problem reveals
that the window in question is not part of a dialog box,
which means that the standard dialog message loop is not active.
Which means that a crucial step is missing.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
Did you remember to
call <code>IsDialogMessage</code> in your message loop?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The customer confirmed that this was the missing step.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
You are right, my window is not a dialog box.
Handling <code>IsDialogMessage</code> solved the issue.
</p></blockquote>
