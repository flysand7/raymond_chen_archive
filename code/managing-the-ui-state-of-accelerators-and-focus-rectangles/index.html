<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Managing the UI state of accelerators and focus rectangles</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Starting with Windows 2000,
keyboard indicators such as underlined accelerators and
focus rectangles (collectively known as “keyboard cues”)
are hidden by default, and are revealed only when you start
using the keyboard.
You can control this behavior from the Desktop Control Panel,
under Appearance, Effects, “Hide underlined letters for keyboard
navigation until I press the Alt key”.
</p>
<p>
Note that this setting actually controls both underlined letters
and focus rectangles, even though the text describes only one
of the effects.  Underlines are hidden until you press the Alt key,
and focus rectangles are hidden until you either press the Alt key
or press the Tab key.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how it works.
</p>
<p>
There are three UI state mesages:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_changeuistate.asp">
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code></a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_queryuistate.asp">
<code>WM_QUERYUISTATE</code></a>
and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_updateuistate.asp">
<code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code></a>.
The third one is, in my opinion, a misnomer.
It really should be called something like <code>WM_UISTATECHANGED</code>
since it is a notification that something has happened, not
a message that you send to cause something to happen.
</p>
<p>
When a dialog box or menu is displayed via a mouse click,
keyboard cues are hidden; if the dialog box or menu was displayed
via a keypress, then keyboard cues are visible.
This decision is made by sending a
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message to the root window with the
<code>UIS_INITIALIZE</code> flag.
This is done automatically by the dialog manager, but if you’re
doing your own custom windows, you’ll have to send it yourself.
</p>
<p>
The <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message bubbles up to the
top-level window, which changes the window UI state accordingly,
then broadcasts a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message to all its child windows
to notify them that the state has changed.
(Of course, if the <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message has no effect—for
example, hiding something that is already hidden—then the
<code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message is optimized out since the entire operation
is a no-op.)
</p>
<p>
When a window that draws keyboard cues
receives a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message,
it typically invalidates itself so that the cues can be redrawn/erased,
depending on the new state.
</p>
<p>
At drawing time, a window that draws keyboard cues can use the
<code>WM_QUERYUISTATE</code> message to determine which keyboard cues are
visible and which are hidden, and draw its content accordingly.
If focus rectangles are hidden, then the window should skip the call
to the <code>DrawFocusRect</code> function.
If keyboard underlines are hidden, then the window suppresses
underlines in its text drawing.  If the window uses
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/fontext_0odw.asp">
the <code>DrawText</code> function</a>,
it can pass the <code>DT_HIDEPREFIX</code> flag
to suppress the underlines.
If you are responding to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/comboboxes/comboboxreference/comboboxmessages/wm_drawitem.asp">
the <code>WM_DRAWITEM</code></a>
message, then you should check for the
<code>ODS_NOACCEL</code> and <code>ODS_NOFOCUSRECT</code> flags
to determine
whether
you should draw an underline accelerator or a focus rectangle.
</p>
<p>
Finally, during execution you may discover that the user has used
the keyboard to perform navigation within your control.
For example, the listview control may have noticed that the user has used
the arrow keys to change the selected item.
When this happens, the control sends itself a <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> specifying
which keyboard cues should be revealed.
As noted above, the <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message eventually causes all the
windows in the window tree to receive a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message
if their states need to change.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/dialogboxes/dialogboxreference/dialogboxfunctions/isdialogmessage.asp">
The <code>IsDialogMessage</code> function</a>
sends
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> messages as appropriate, so dialog boxes
and anybody else who uses <code>IsDialogMessage</code> gets
keyboard-cues tracking for free.</p>
