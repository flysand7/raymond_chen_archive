<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The implementation of anonymous methods in C# and its consequences (part 2)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Last time we took a look at how anonymous methods are implemented.
Today we’ll look at a puzzle that can be solved with what we’ve learned.
Consider the following program fragment:
</p>
<pre>
using System;
class MyClass {
 delegate void DelegateA();
 delegate void DelegateB();
 static DelegateB ConvertDelegate(DelegateA d)
 {
  return (DelegateB)
   Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(DelegateB), d.Method);
 }
 static public void Main()
 {
  int i = 0;
  ConvertDelegate(delegate { Console.WriteLine(0); });
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>ConvertDelegate</code> method merely converts
a <code>DelegateA</code> to a <code>DelegateB</code>
by creating a <code>DelegateB</code> with the same underlying
method.
Since the two delegate types use the same signature,
this conversion goes off without a hitch.
</p>
<p>
But now let’s make a small change to that <code>Main</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
 static public void Main()
 {
  int i = 0;
  // one character change - 0 becomes i
  ConvertDelegate(delegate { Console.WriteLine(<font color="blue">i</font>); });
 }
</pre>
<p>
Now the program crashes with a
<code>System.ArgumentException</code> at the point where
we try to create the <code>DelegateB</code>.
What’s going on?
</p>
<p>
First,
observe that the overload of <code>Delegate.CreateDelegate</code>
that was used is one that can only be used to create delegates
from static methods.
Next, note that in <code>Test1</code>,
the anonymous method references neither its own members
nor any local variables from its lexically-enclosing method.
Therefore, the resulting anonymous method is
a “static anonymous method of the easy type”.
Since the anonymous method is a static member,
the use of the “static members only” overload of
<code>Delegate.CreateDelegate</code> succeeds.
</p>
<p>
However, in <code>Test2</code>, the anonymous method dereferences the
<code>i</code> variable from its lexically-enclosing method.
This forces the anonymous method to be a “anonymous method of the hard type”,
and those anonymous methods use an anonymous instance member function
of an anonymous helper class.
As a result,
<code>d.Method</code> is an instance method, and the chosen overload of
<code>Delegate.CreateDelegate</code> throws an invalid parameter
exception since it works only with static methods.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to use a different overload of
<code>Delegate.CreateDelegate</code>,
one that work with either static or instance member functions.
</p>
<pre>
 DelegateB ConvertDelegate(DelegateA d)
 {
  return (DelegateB)
   Delegate.CreateDelegate(typeof(DelegateB), <font color="blue">d.Target,</font> d.Method);
 }
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Delegate.CreateDelegate(Type, Object, MethodInfo)</code>
overload creates a delegate for a static method if the
<code>Object</code> parameter is <code>null</code> or
a delegate for an instance method if the <code>Object</code>
parameter is non-<code>null</code>.
Hardly by coincidence, that is exactly what <code>d.Target</code> produces.
If the original delegate is for a static method, then
<code>d.Target</code> is <code>null</code>; otherwise, it is
the object for which the instance method is to be invoked on.
</p>
<p>
This fix, therefore, makes the <code>ConvertDelegate</code>
function handle conversion of delegates for either static or
instance methods.
Which is a good thing, because it may now be called upon to
convert delegates for instance methods as well as static ones.
</p>
<p>
Okay, this time we were lucky that the hidden gotcha of anonymous
methods resulted in an exception.
Next time, we’ll see a gotcha that merely results in incorrect
behavior that will probably take you forever to track down.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b>: This behavior
<a>
changed in Visual Studio 2015</a>
with
the switch to the Roslyn compiler.
For performance reasons,
anonymous methods are now always instance methods, even if they
capture nothing.</p>
