<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I request that my out-of-process COM server run unelevated?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>By default, if an elevated process creates an out-of-process COM server, that COM server also runs elevated. The <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/larryosterman/2005/10/18/activate-as-activator-activates-as-activator/"><i>Activate as Activator</i> policy</a> runs the COM server with the same identity as the caller. When applied to an elevated caller, it means that client gets an elevated server running with the same identity.  </p>
<p>To force the out-of-process COM server to run unelevated, set the <b>RunAs</b> value under the <b>AppID</b> key as follows:  </p>
<pre>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\AppID\{guid}]
  RunAs="Interactive User"
</pre>
<p>This causes the server to activate as the currently logged-in user for the session, even if the activator is running elevated.  </p>
<p>Be aware that the currently logged-in user may, nevertheless, be elevated if UAC is disabled, so this is not a guaranteed way to get a non-elevated server. Still, if UAC is disabled, then there is no such thing as an unelevated administrator, so the thing you’re asking for doesn’t exist in the first place. </p>
