<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the order of evaluation in C#?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The C and C++ languages leave the order of evaluation generally
unspecified aside from specific locations called <i>sequence points</i>.
Side effects of operations performed prior to the sequence point
are guaranteed visible to operations performed after it.¹
For example, the C comma operator introduces a sequence point.
When you write <code>f(),
g()</code>, the language guarantees
that any changes to program state made by the function <code>f</code>
can be seen by the function <code>g</code>;
<code>f</code> executes before <code>g</code>.
On the other hand, the multiplication operator does not introduce
a sequence point.
If you write <code>f() * g()</code>
there is no guarantee which side will be evaluated first.
</p>
<p>
(Note that order of evaluation is not the same as associativity and
operator precedence.
Given the expression <code>f() + g() * h()</code>,
operator precedence says that it should be evaluated
as if it were written <code>f() + (g() * h())</code>,
but that doesn’t say what order the three functions will be evaluated.
It merely describes how the results of the three functions will be
combined.)
</p>
<p>
In the C# language, the order of evaluation is spelled out more
explicitly.
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa691322">
The order of evaluation for operators is left to right</a>.
if you write <code>f() + g()</code> in C#,
the language guarantees that
<code>f()</code> will be evaluated first.
The example in the linked-to page is even clearer.
The expression <code>F(i) + G(i++) * H(i)</code> is
evaluated as if it were written like this:
</p>
<pre>
temp1 = F(i);
temp2 = i++;
temp3 = G(temp2);
temp4 = H(i);
return temp1 + temp3 * temp4;
</pre>
<p>
The side effects of each part of the expression take effect in left-to-right
order.
Even
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa691335">
the order of evaluation of function arguments is strictly left-to-right</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa691105">
the compiler has permission to evaluate the operands in
a different order if it can prove that the alternate order of evaluation
has the same effect as the original one</a>
(in the absence of asynchronous exceptions).
</p>
<p>
Why does C# take a much more restrictive view of the order of evaluation?
I don’t know, but I can guess.²</p>
<p><p>
My guess is that the language designers wanted to reduce the
frequency of a category
of subtle bugs (in this case, order-of-evaluation dependency).
There are many other examples of this in the language design.
Consider:
</p>
<pre>
class A {
 void f()
 {
  int i = 1;
  if (true) {
   int i = 2; // error - redeclaration
  }
 }
 int x;
 void g()
 {
  x = 3; // error - using variable before declared
  int x = 2;
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
The language designers specified that
the scope of a local variable in C# extends to the
<i>entire</i> block in which it is declared.
As a first consequence of this,
the second declaration of <code>i</code>
in the function <code>f()</code>
is illegal since its scope overlaps with the scope of the first
declaration.
This removes a class of bugs that can be traced to one local variable
masking another with the same name.
</p>
<p>
In the function <code>g()</code> the assignment <code>x = 3;</code>
is illegal because the <code>x</code> refers not to the member variable
but to the local variable declared below it.
Notice that the scope of the local variable begins with the entire block,
and <i>not</i> with the point of declaration as it would have been in C++.

¹This is a simplified definition of <i>sequence point</i>.

²I have not historically included the sentence
“I don’t know but I can guess” because this is a blog,
not formal documentation.
Everything is my opinion, recollection, or interpretation.
But it seems that people take what I say to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/10/4315707.aspx#4334811">
establish the official Microsoft position on things</a>,
so now I have to go back and add explicit disclaimers.</p>
