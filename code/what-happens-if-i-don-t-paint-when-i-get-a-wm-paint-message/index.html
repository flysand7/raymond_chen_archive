<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happens if I don't paint when I get a WM_PAINT message?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Suppose your window procedure doesn’t paint when it gets a
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message.
What happens?
</p>
<p>
It depends on how you don’t paint.
</p>
<p>
If you have an explicit handler for the
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message
that does nothing but return without painting,
then the window manager will turn around and
put a new
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message in your queue.
“And try harder this time.”
Remember that the rules for the
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message are that the window manager will
generate a
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message
for any window that has a dirty region.
If you fail to remove the dirty region in your
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message handler,
well, then the rules state that you get another
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message.
(The most common way of clearing the dirty region is to call
<code>Begin­Paint</code>,
but there are other less common ways,
like
<code>Validate­Rect</code> or
<code>Redraw­Window</code> with the <code>RDW_VALIDATE</code> flag.)
</p>
<p>
The other case is that you
simply don’t have a <code>WM_PAINT</code> handler
and let the message fall through to
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code>.
In that case,
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code>
will do a blank paint for you.
In other words,
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code> contains
the logical equivalent of
</p>
<pre>
case WM_PAINT:
 {
  PAINTSTRUCT ps;
  if (BeginPaint(hwnd, &amp;ps))
   EndPaint(hwnd, &amp;ps);
 }
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>
In the case where you pass the
<code>WM_PAINT</code> to
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code>,
the dirty region is cleared because
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code>
will call
<code>Begin­Paint</code> for you.
</p>
<p>
There are some quirks in the handling of the
<code>WM_PAINT</code> message by the
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code> function
to handle various application compatibility cases,
but the above is the basic idea.
</p>
<p>
To avoid tripping over the weird application compatibility
cases, decide up front how you want to deal with
<code>WM_PAINT</code> messages delivered to your window
procedure.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle them completely
    by calling
    <code>Begin­Paint</code> and
    <code>End­Paint</code>,
    then returning 0.
    (Do not pass the message to
    <code>Def­Window­Proc</code>.)
<li>Pass them all to
    <code>Def­Window­Proc</code>,
    and let it do the
    <code>Begin­Paint</code> and
    <code>End­Paint</code>.
</li></li></ul>
<p>
Don’t try playing fancy games like
“Oh, I’m going to call
<code>Begin­Paint</code> and
<code>End­Paint</code>,
but sometimes I’m <i>also</i> going to pass the message to
<code>Def­Window­Proc</code> afterwards.”
Just pick one plan and stick to it.
It’s a lot simpler for everybody that way.</p>
