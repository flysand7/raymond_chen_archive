<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Psychic debugging: Why doesn't my program show up when I call ShellExecute?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
This question came in from a customer (paraphrased):
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
If I run my program from the command prompt, it works great,
but if I run it from my launcher via <code>ShellExecuteEx</code>,
it never appears.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
See how good your psychic powers are at solving this problem
before I give you the second question that gives away the answer.
</p>
<p>
Any luck?
</p>
<p>
Here’s a second question from a different source (but which
coincidentally came in the same day).
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I’m trying to use <code>ShellExecute</code> to open a document.
The function succeeds (returns a value greater than 32),
but I don’t get anything on the screen.
</p>
<pre>
if (ShellExecute(Handle, NULL, FileName, NULL,
    NULL, NULL) &lt;= (HINSTANCE)32) ...
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The problem the second person is having lies in the last parameter
to the <code>ShellExecute</code> function.
It’s <code>nShowCmd</code>, which is supposed to be an
<code>SW_*</code> value, but which this person is passing as
<code>NULL</code>.
It so happens, that the value zero corresponds to
<code>SW_HIDE</code>, which explains why the program doesn’t
appear: You told it to run hidden!
</p>
<p>
Now go back to the first problem.
Do you see what the person most likely did wrong?
The code probably went like this:
</p>
<pre>
SHELLEXECUTEINFO sei = { sizeof(sei) };
sei.hwnd = hwnd;
sei.lpVerb = TEXT("open");
sei.lpFile = pszFile;
ShellExecuteEx(&amp;sei);
</pre>
<p>
Since the <code>sei.nShow</code> member was not explicitly
set,  the value was implicitly set to zero by the incomplete
initializer.
And as we noted above, zero means <code>SW_HIDE</code>.
</p>
<p>
It turns out my psychic debugging was correct.
That was indeed the source of the first person’s problem.
Now you can use your psychic powers, too.</p>
