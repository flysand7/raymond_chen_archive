<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The dialog manager, part 4: The dialog loop</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The dialog loop is actually quite simple. At its core,
it’s just</p>
<pre>
while (&lt;dialog still active&gt; &amp;&amp;
       GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, 0)) {
 if (!IsDialogMessage(hdlg, &amp;msg)) {
  TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
  DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
If you want something fancier in your dialog loop,
you can take the loop above and tinker with it.
</p>
<p>
But let’s start from the beginning.
The work happens in DialogBoxIndirectParam.
(<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/29/403298.aspx">You should already know by now how to convert all
the other DialogBoxXxx functions into DialogBoxIndirectParam</a>.)
</p>
<pre>
INT_PTR WINAPI DialogBoxIndirectParam(
    HINSTANCE hinst,
    LPCDLGTEMPLATE lpTemplate, HWND hwndParent,
    DLGPROC lpDlgProc, LPARAM lParam)
{
 /*
  * App hack!  Some people pass GetDesktopWindow()
  * as the owner instead of NULL.  Fix them so the
  * desktop doesn't get disabled!
  */
 if (hwndParent == GetDesktopWindow())
  hwndParent = NULL;
</pre>
<p>
That’s right, we start with an app hack.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/24/79212.aspx">
The problem of passing GetDesktopWindow() instead of NULL
was discussed
in an earlier entry</a>.
So many people make this mistake that we had to put this app hack
into the core OS.  It would be pointless to make a shim for it
since that would mean that thousands of apps would need to be shimmed.
</p>
<p>
Since only top-level windows can be owners, we have to
take the putative <code>hwndParent</code>
(which might be a child window) and walk up the window hierarchy
until we find a top-level window.</p>
<pre>
 if (hwndParent)
  hwndParent = GetAncestor(hwndParent, GA_ROOT);
</pre>
<p>
With that second app hack out of the way, we create the dialog.
</p>
<pre>
 HWND hdlg = CreateDialogIndirectParam(hinst,
               lpTemplate, hwndParent, lpDlgProc,
               lParam);
</pre>
<p>
Note: As before, I am going to ignore error checking and
various dialog box esoterica because it would just be
distracting from the main point of this entry.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/18/376080.aspx">
Modal windows disable their parent</a>, so do it here.
</p>
<pre>
 BOOL fWasEnabled = EnableWindow(hwndParent, FALSE);
</pre>
<p>
We then fall into the dialog modal loop:
</p>
<pre>
 MSG msg;
 while (&lt;dialog still active&gt; &amp;&amp;
        GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
  if (!IsDialogMessage(hdlg, &amp;msg)) {
   TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
   DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
  }
 }
</pre>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/22/378018.aspx">
Per the convention on quit messages</a>, we re-post any
quit message we may have received so the next outer
modal loop can see it.
</p>
<pre>
 if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) {
  PostQuitMessage((int)msg.wParam);
 }
</pre>
<p>
(Astute readers may have noticed an uninitialized
variable bug: If EndDialog was called during
WM_INITDIALOG handling, then msg.message is never set.
I decided to ignore this fringe case for expository purposes.)
</p>
<p>
Now that the dialog is complete, we clean up.
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/27/81155.aspx">
Remember to enable the owner before destroying the
owned dialog</a>.
</p>
<pre>
if (fWasEnabled)
 EnableWindow(hwndParent, TRUE);
DestroyWindow(hdlg);
</pre>
<p>
And that’s all. Return the result.
</p>
<pre>
 return &lt;value passed to EndDialog&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>
Congratulations, you are now an expert on dialog boxes.
Tomorrow we’ll look at how you can put this new expertise
to good use.
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Find a way to sneak through the two layers of
<code>hwndParent</code> parameter “repair” and end up with
a dialog box whose owner is the desktop window.
Explain the dire consequences of this scenario.</p>
