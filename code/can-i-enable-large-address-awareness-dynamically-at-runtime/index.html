<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can I enable Large Address Awareness dynamically at runtime?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/largeaddressaware-handle-large-addresses">The <code>/LARGE­ADDRESS­AWARE</code> flag</a> is recorded <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150518-00/?p=45581">in the header of the executable</a>. A customer wanted to know if there was a way to select at runtime whether a process is large address aware. They were willing to accept an override in <code>Image File Execution Options</code>, if that’s what it took. The customer wanted to do this as part of a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238502.aspx">feature-flight</a>, but they were concerned that third-party add-ins may behave unexpectedly when run in a large-address-aware process, and they would like a way to disable large address awareness on the fly. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to change the setting at runtime, nor is there an override in <code>Image File Execution Options</code>. The value in the header of the executable is what the system uses to determine whether to give the process access to address space above the 2<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">GB</a> boundary. </p>
<p>But wait, all is not lost. </p>
<p>What the customer could do is ship <i>two</i> versions of the program, byte-for-byte identical except that one of them has the <code>/LARGE</code><code>ADDRESS</code><code>AWARE</code> flag set, and the other has it clear.¹ They could then have their feature-flight system update the Start menu shortcut to point to the one that they want to test. </p>
<p>Another approach is to register the large-address-aware version in the Start menu, and have it check the feature-flight flag when it is launched. If the flag says to disable large-address-awareness, then the program launches the not-large-address-aware version with the same command line. </p>
<p>Yes, it’s a bit clunky, but at least it’s do-able. </p>
<p>¹ To reduce disk space, they could move the bulk of their code into a DLL and have the EXE be a stub that loads the DLL and then calls the <code>Run­The­Program</code> function in the dll. </p>
