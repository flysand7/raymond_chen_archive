<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The __fortran calling convention isn't the calling convention used by FORTRAN</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Although the Microsoft C compiler supports a calling convention called
<code>__fortran</code>,
that’s just what the calling convention is called;
its relationship with the FORTRAN programming language is only coincidental.
The <code>__fortran</code> keyword is now just an old-fashioned
synonym for <code>__stdcall</code>.
</p>
<p>
Various FORTRAN compilers use different calling conventions;
the one I describe here applies to the now-defunct
Microsoft Fortran PowerStation.
</p>
<p>
Fortran Powerstation pushes parameters on the stack right-to-left,
with callee-cleanup.
(So far, this matches
<code>__fortran</code> aka <code>__stdcall</code>.)
Function names are
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa278674(VS.60).aspx">
converted to all-uppercase, with an underscore
at the beginning and <code>@n</code> appended</a>,
where <code>n</code> is the number of bytes of parameters.
(This still matches <code>__stdcall</code> aside from the uppercase
conversion.)
</p>
<p>
As for how the parameters are passed, well, that’s where things
get weird.
FORTRAN natively
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa294334(VS.60).aspx">
passes all parameters by reference</a>.
This is the source of a famous classic FORTRAN bug known as
<i>constants aren’t</i>.
</p>
<pre>
      PROGRAM MYSTERY
      CALL MAGIC(1)
      PRINT *, 'According to the computer, 3 + 1 is ', ADDUP(3, 1)
      END
      FUNCTION ADDUP(I, J)
      ADDUP = I + J
      END
C     What does this subroutine actually do?
      SUBROUTINE MAGIC(I)
      I = 9
      RETURN
      END
</pre>
<p>
(It’s been a long time since I’ve written a FORTRAN program,
so I may have gotten some of the details wrong,
but any errors shouldn’t detract from the fundamental issue.)
</p>
<p>
When you run this program, it says
</p>
<pre>
According to the computer, 3 + 1 is 12
</pre>
<p>
How did that happen?
We called a function that adds two numbers together,
and instead of getting 4, we get 12?
</p>
<p>
The reason is the subroutine <code>MAGIC</code>:
We passed it the constant <code>1</code>,
and since all FORTRAN parameters are passed by reference,
the assignment <code>I = 9</code>
<i>modifies the constant 1</i>.
In C:
</p>
<pre>
int One = 1;
int Three = 3;
int Nine = 9;
void Magic(int *i) { *i = Nine; }
int AddUp(int *i, int *j) { return *i + *j; }
void main()
{
 Magic(&amp;One);
 printf("According to the computer, 3 + 1 is %d\n",
        AddUp(&amp;Three, &amp;One));
}
</pre>
<p>
Since <code>Magic</code> modified the constant <code>One</code>,
any further use of the constant 1 ends up using the value 9!
(According to the FORTRAN standard,
modifying a constant results in undefined behavior.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to calling conventions.
Other significant differences between C and FORTRAN:
In FORTRAN,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa293547(VS.60).aspx">
array indices begin at 1, not 0,
and arrays are stored in column-major order</a>
rather than row-major as in C.
</p>
<p>
<code>COMPLEX</code> variables in FORTRAN
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa296568(VS.60).aspx">
are stored as two floating point numbers</a>
(corresponding to the real and imaginary components).
</p>
<p>
Functions which return <code>COMPLEX</code> or
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa236488(VS.60).aspx">
<code>CHARACTER*(*)</code></a>
are internally rewritten as subroutines where the location to store the
return value is passed as a hidden first parameter.
(This is analogous to how C returns large structures.)
</p>
<p>
The final commonly-encountered
weirdness of FORTRAN is that <code>CHARACTER*n</code> data types
(which are used to hold strings) are
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa236488(VS.60).aspx">
passed as <i>two</i> parameters</a>:
The address of the character buffer,
followed by the size of the buffer (n).
Note that FORTRAN <code>CHARACTER*n</code> variables are
fixed-length;
if you assign a string shorter than the buffer,
it is padded with spaces.
There is no null terminator.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I sort of got carried away with the FORTRAN calling convention.
It’s definitely more complicated than just sticking
<code>__fortran</code> in front of your function.
But at least the <code>__fortran</code> keyword takes care of the
part that can’t be expressed in C.
The rest you can manage on your own.</p>
