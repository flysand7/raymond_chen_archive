<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can call MsgWaitForMultipleObjects with zero handles</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
There is no <code>WaitMessageTimeout</code> function,
but you can create your own with the assistance of
the <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> function.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL WaitMessageTimeout(DWORD dwTimeout)
{
 return MsgWaitForMultipleObjects(
    0, NULL, FALSE, dwTimeout, QS_ALLINPUT)
      == WAIT_TIMEOUT;
}
</pre>
<p>
To wait for a message with timeout, we use
the <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code>
in a vacuous sense:
You pass it a list of objects you want to wait for,
as well as a timeout and a set of queue states,
asking that the function return when any of the
objects is signalled or when a message is ready.
By passing no objects, the only thing left to wait
for is an incoming message.
</p>
<p>
Next time, we’ll see how this basic idea can be used
to build a slightly more complex function.

[1/26: Fix call to MsgWaitForMultipleObjects; had it confused
with MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx.
That’s what happens when you write entries on an airplane.]</p>
