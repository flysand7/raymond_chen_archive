<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It’s okay to be contrary, but you need to be consistently contrary: Going against the ambient character set</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In Windows, you declare your character set preference implicitly by defining or not defining the symbol <code>UNICODE</code> <a href="/code/if-you-re-going-to-configure-a-header-file-you-have-to-do-it-before-you-include-the-header-file" title="If you're going to configure a header file, you have to do it before you include the header file"> before including the <code>windows.h</code> header file</a>. (Related: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040212-00/?p=40643" title="TEXT vs. _TEXT vs. _T, and UNICODE vs. _UNICODE"> TEXT vs. _TEXT vs. _T, and UNICODE vs. _UNICODE</a>.) This determines whether undecorated function names redirect to the ANSI version or the Unicode version, but it doesn’t make the opposite-version inaccessible. You just have to call them by their explicit names. And it’s important that you be consistent about it. If you miss a spot, the characters get all messed up.</p>
<pre>// UNICODE not defined
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

void UpdateTitle(HWND hwnd, PCWSTR title)
{
    <span style="color: blue;">SetWindowTextW</span>(hwnd, title);
}
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we did not define the symbol <code>UNICODE</code>, so the ambient character set is ANSI. Since we want to call the Unicode version of <code>Set­Window­Text</code>, we must use its explicit Unicode name <code>Set­Window­TextW</code>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, these errors are detected at compile time due to type mismatches. For example, if we forgot to put the trailing <code>W</code> on the function name, we would get the error</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">error C2664: 'BOOL SetWindowTextA(HWND,const char *)': cannot convert argument 2 from 'const wchar_t *' to 'const char *'
note: Types pointed to are unrelated; conversion requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast
</pre>
<p>And that’s your clue that you forgot to W-ize the <code>Set­Window­Text</code> call. You should have called the W version explicitly: <code>Set­Window­TextW</code>.</p>
<p>However, there’s a category of functions that elude this compile-time detection: The functions that have separate ANSI and Unicode versions but take only character-set-independent parameters. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20181101-00/?p=100105" title="If the prototypes of DispatchMessageA and DispatchMessageW are identical, why have both?"> Common examples</a> are <code>Dispatch­Message</code>, <code>Translate­Message</code>, <code>Translate­Accelerator</code>, <code>Create­Accelerator­Table</code>, and most notably, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190110-00/?p=100675" title="Why am I getting mojibake when I try to create a window?"> <code>Def­Window­Proc</code></a>.</p>
<p>For some reason, when I get called in to investigate this sort of problem, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20191030-00/?p=103036"> it’s usually the <code>Def­Window­Proc</code></a> that is the source of the problem.</p>
<p>But I don’t think it’s because people get the others right and miss the <code>Def­Window­Proc</code>. I think it’s because the mistakes in the other functions are much less noticeable. The mistakes are still there, and maybe you’ll get a bug report from a user in Japan when they run into it, but that’s not something that is going to be noticed in English-based testing as much as a string that is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180207-00/?p=97985" title="Why does misinterpreting UTF16-LE Unicode text as ANSI tend to show up as just one character?"> truncated down to its first letter</a>.</p>
