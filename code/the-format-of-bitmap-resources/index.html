<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The format of bitmap resources</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Another in a sporadic series on the format of Win32 resources.
 Here’s a question from a customer:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I’m noticing some strange behavior: When I call <code>LoadResource</code> then <code>LockResource</code> on an embedded bitmap, the data being returned by <code>LockResource</code> is not a properly formatted bitmap. The data is missing the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>, but the rest of the file is there. <code>SizeOfResource</code> also states that the bitmap resource is 14 bytes smaller than it actually is. 14 bytes happens to be equal to <code>sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER)</code>.   However, if I load the bitmap directly using <code>LoadBitmap</code>, everything works fine. If I look at the resource using Visual Studio, the Bitmap displays correctly and the binary data correctly includes the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>. </p>
<p> Anyone have any ideas as to why <code>LoadResource</code> is not correctly returning the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Amusingly, a change to the word order changes the question to its own answer: <code>LoadResource</code> is <i>correctly</i> <i>not</i> returning the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>.
 In other words, <code>LoadResource</code> is not stripping off the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>: <code>rc.exe</code> is.
 The format of bitmap resources are pretty simple. They are just a bitmap file with the <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code> stripped off. Because it’s just the <i>file header</i>, the thing tacked onto the front when saved as a file. It’s not part of the bitmap itself. For example, if you are using a <code>BITMAPINFOHEADER</code>-formatted bitmap, then the resource format is a <code>BITMAPINFOHEADER</code> followed by the pixels.
 I can’t explain why Visual Studio is showing you a <code>BITMAPFILEHEADER</code> that doesn’t exist. They’re probably trying to reduce confusion for people who don’t know the format of bitmap resources and wonder why the binary data doesn’t match their <code>.bmp</code> file. Of course, in so doing, they end up creating confusion for people who do know the format of bitmap resources, or—as happened here—people who don’t know the format of bitmap resources and think that the <code>LoadResource</code> function is messing with their bitmaps.</p>
<p> (For the record, the <code>LoadResource</code> function doesn’t mess with bitmaps, icons, menus, or whatever. It just returns the raw binary data of a Win32 resource. It doesn’t know the internal format of those resources any more than the file system knows the internal format of a Quicken data file or a shortcut file.) </p>
