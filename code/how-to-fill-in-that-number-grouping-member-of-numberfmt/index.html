<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to fill in that number grouping member of NUMBERFMT</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you look at the <code>NUMBERFMT</code> structure, the way groups are expressed by the <code>Grouping</code> member do not match the value returned by <code>LOCALE_SGROUPING</code>:</p>

<p> <code>LOCALE_SGROUPING</code> expresses grouping as a series of semicolon-separated numbers, each expressing the number of digits in each group (least-significant group first). A trailing zero indicates that the last grouping should be repeated indefinitely. For example, “3;2;0” means “Group the three least significant digits, then in twos until you run out of digits.” If there is no trailing “;0”, then there are no commas past that point. For example, “3” means “Group the three least significant digits, then stop.”
 The <code>Grouping</code> member expresses the grouping rules  differently. Each significant digit represents a group, with the most significant digit representing the least-significant group, with the units digit repeated indefinitely. For example, “32” means “make a group of three digits, then group by twos thereafter.” To suppress the repetition, multiply by ten.
 In other words, the two systems are basically the same, with the <code>Grouping</code> consisting of the <code>LOCALE_SGROUPING</code> string with the semicolons removed. Except that the meaning of the trailing zero is reversed, so if <code>LOCALE_SGROUPING</code> has a trailing zero, you have to remove it to get the <code>Grouping</code>, and if it lacks a trailing zero, then you have to add one to the <code>Grouping</code>.
 It’s kind of strange that the two systems differ, considering that they both came from the same NLS team! It’s probably a case of parallel evolution, wherein the locale-string folks and the number-formatting folks came up with their respective systems independently.
 Writing code to implement this conversion from <code>LOCALE_SGROUPING</code> to <code>Grouping</code> shouldn’t be hard once you understand the algorithm, so I’ll leave that as an exercise.</p>
<p> Fortunately, in real life you rarely have need to perform this conversion, for you can just pass the desired locale as the first parameter to the <code>GetNumberFormat</code> (or even better, <code>LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT</code>), pass a <code>NULL</code> pointer as the <code>lpNumberFormat</code>, and let NLS do all the work. </p>
