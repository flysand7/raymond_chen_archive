<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to perform more complicated search and replace-style renaming in a batch file</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, we looked at <a href="/history/how-did-copying-and-renaming-with-wildcards-work-in-ms-dos" title="How did copying and renaming with wildcards work in MS-DOS?"> how copying and renaming with wildcards worked in MS-DOS</a>, and how it doesn’t work well if you are trying to perform search-and-replace operations where the strings have different lengths.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a list of files, say <tt>fred001.txt</tt> through <tt>fred999.txt</tt> and you want to rename them to <tt>wilma001.txt</tt> through <tt>wilma999.txt</tt>, the obvious command</p>
<pre>ren fred*.txt wilma*.txt
</pre>
<p>will not produce the desired results because the <tt>a</tt> in <tt>wilma</tt> overwrites the first character that was matched by the wildcard in the source pattern, since <tt>fred</tt> is only four characters long.</p>
<p>You can still get what you want; you just won’t be able to use the wildcard algorithm to do it.</p>
<pre>setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
for %%i in (fred*.txt) do set "_=%%i" &amp; ren "%%i" "!_:fred=wilma!"
</pre>
<p>We write a little batch file to perform the bulk rename operation.</p>
<p>The main loop is driven by the <code>FOR</code> command, which we ask to enumerate all the files that match the pattern <tt>fred*.txt</tt>. For each such file, we set the variable <tt>_</tt> to the file name. I like to use <tt>_</tt> as a scratch variable name in batch files because it’s unlikely to collide with a name that means something to any particular program.¹</p>
<p>We then perform a non-wildcard <code>ren</code> command. The source file name is the file name which the <code>FOR</code> command gave us. The destination file name is the result of a search-replace operation with the <tt>_</tt> variable, where we ask to search for <tt>fred</tt> and change it to <tt>wilma</tt>.</p>
<p>This is a two-liner instead of a one-liner because we need to enable delayed expansion so that we can delay the search-replace operation until after the <tt>_</tt> variable is set.</p>
<p>If I need to do some sort of fancy renaming, I don’t do any of this. I’ll do a <code>dir /b</code> and dump the list of file names into a file. Then I’ll edit that file and use the editor’s fancy search-replace features to convert it into a list of <code>REN</code> commands. I’ll look over the results to verify that they are doing what I want, and possibly perform some editing to deal with special cases like “Don’t rename <tt>fred314.txt</tt>; that one stays unchanged.” Once I’m satisfied, I save the results as a batch file and run it.</p>
<p>If the editing is particularly complicated, I’ll write a one-off program to generate the batch file. I prefer generating a batch file to having the one-off program perform the renames directly, because that lets me preview the operation. You don’t want to mess it up.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The reimagined <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys"> Windows PowerToys</a> includes an interactive bulk renaming tool called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/wiki/PowerRename-Overview"> PowerRename</a>.</p>
<p>¹ Sometimes people new to batch programming will have need for a temporary variable to hold a path, and they call it <tt>PATH</tt>. This tends to result in a lot of head-scratching, since they are unwittingly modifying the executable search path.</p>
