<p> Answer to <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/d680eeef-00e5-4c2b-b8fe-ec8f6c88c2d8"> previous exercise</a>: The <code>m_fRecursing</code> flag does not need to be per-instance. It only needs to be valid long enough that the recursive call that comes immediately afterwards can be detected. However, a global variable would not work because two threads might be inside the recursive <code>DefDlgProc</code> call simultaneously. But a thread-local variable would work. (If you prefer to code in plain C or don’t want to use classes, you may find this alternative easier to work with.)</p>
