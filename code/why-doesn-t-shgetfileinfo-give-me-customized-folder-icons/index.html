<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn’t SHGetFileInfo give me customized folder icons?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that they were unable to obtain cutomized folder icons. Whenever they asked for the icon for a folder, they always got a plain folder icon, Even if they asked for folders like My Documents, which  come with their own custom icons. The customer says that they are using the code from <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/2532/obtaining-and-managing-file-and-folder-icons-using">this Web site</a>: </p>
<pre>
public static System.Drawing.Icon GetFileIcon(string name, IconSize size, 
                                              bool linkOverlay)
{
    Shell32.SHFILEINFO shfi = new Shell32.SHFILEINFO();
    uint flags = Shell32.SHGFI_ICON | Shell32.SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES;
    
    if (true == linkOverlay) flags += Shell32.SHGFI_LINKOVERLAY;


    /* Check the size specified for return. */
    if (IconSize.Small == size)
    {
        flags += Shell32.SHGFI_SMALLICON ; // include the small icon flag
    } 
    else 
    {
        flags += Shell32.SHGFI_LARGEICON ;  // include the large icon flag
    }
    
    Shell32.SHGetFileInfo( name, 
        Shell32.FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 
        ref shfi, 
        (uint) System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf(shfi), 
        flags );


    // Copy (clone) the returned icon to a new object, thus allowing us 
    // to call DestroyIcon immediately
    System.Drawing.Icon icon = (System.Drawing.Icon)
                         System.Drawing.Icon.FromHandle(shfi.hIcon).Clone();
    User32.DestroyIcon( shfi.hIcon ); // Cleanup
    return icon;
}

<p>As I noted some time ago, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040601-00/?p=39073">the <code>SHGFI_USE­FILE­ATTRIBUTES</code> flag means</a> “Pretend that the file/directory exists, and that its file attributes are what I passed as the dwFileAttributes parameter. Do this regardless of whether it actually exists or not.” </p>
<p>Since you’re passing the flag, and you say “Trust me, it’s a directory,” the shell says, “Okay, then here’s the icon for a standard directory. I can’t give you anything better than that because you told me not to access the disk.” </p>
<p>If you want to get the icon for a live file or directory, then remove the <code>SHGFI_USE­FILE­ATTRIBUTES</code> flag. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Yes, somebody posted a comment on that Web site asking how to get the function to work for special folders, and somebody else posted the same answer (namely, remove the <code>SHGFI_USE­FILE­ATTRIBUTES</code> flag). But that question/answer was posted long after our customer asked the question. </p>
