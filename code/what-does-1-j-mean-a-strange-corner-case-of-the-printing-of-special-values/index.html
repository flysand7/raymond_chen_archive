<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does 1#J mean? A strange corner case of the printing of special values</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
As a puzzle, commenter nobugz
asks,
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/21/10395734.aspx#10397012">What kind of infinity is <code>1.#J</code></a>?”
</p>
<pre>
double z = 0;
printf(“%.2f”, 1/z);
</pre>
<p>
Now, the division by zero results in IEEE positive infinity,
would would normally be printed as
<code>1#INF</code>.
But the catch here is that the print format says
“Display at most two places after the decimal point.”
But where is the decimal point in infinity?
</p>
<p>
The Visual C runtime library arbitrarily decided that
all of the exceptional values have one digit before
the decimal (namely, the <code>“1”</code>).
Actually, it turns out that this puzzle might be an
answer to Random832’s question,
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/21/10395734.aspx#10396209">What’s
the 1 for</a>?”
Maybe the 1 is there so that there is a digit at all.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so now you have one digit before the decimal
(the <code>“1”</code>),
and now you need to show at most two places after the decimal.
But <code>“#INF”</code> is too long to fit into two characters.
The C runtime then says,
“Well, then I’d better round it off to two places, then.”
</p>
<p>
The first character is <code>“#”</code>.
The second character is <code>“I”</code>.
Now we need to round it.
That’s done by inspecting the third character,
which is <code>“N”</code>.
We all learned in grade school that you round up if the next
digit is 5 or greater.
And it so happens that the code point for
<code>“N”</code> is numerically higher than the code point for
<code>“5”</code>,
so the value is rounded up by incrementing the previous digit.
Incrementing <code>“I”</code> gives you
<code>“J”</code>.
</p>
<p>
That’s why printing IEEE positive infinity to two places
gives you the strange-looking <code>“1#J”</code>.
The <code>J</code> is an <code>I</code> that got rounded up.
</p>
<p>
I doubt this behavior was intended;
it’s just a consequence of taking a rounding algorithm intended
for digits and applying it to non-digits.
</p>
<p>
Of course, in phonetics, rounding an <i>i</i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel">
produces a <i>ü</i></a>.
Imagine the nerdiness of rounding
<code>“1#INF”</code> to two places and producing
<code>“1#Ü”</code>.
That would have been awesome.
