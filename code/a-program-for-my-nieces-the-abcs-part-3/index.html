<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A program for my nieces: The ABCs, part 3</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One problem I discovered when my nieces ran my initial
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/08/10432277.aspx">
ABC program</a>
was that they had a habit of holding down a key,
thereby triggering autorepeat.
I had instructed them not to mash the keyboard but rather
to press only one key at a time,
and while they were good at adhering to the “one key at a time”
rule,
they also interpreted it as
“type really slowly”
and ended up autorepeating a lot.
</p>
<p>
So let’s disable keyboard autorepeat.
</p>
<p>
Of course, one way to do this would be to change the system
keyboard autorepeat setting,
but that would be
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx">
using global state to manage a local problem</a>.
Instead, we just filter the autorepeats out of our edit control:
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubclassProc(
    HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,
    UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData)
{
  switch (uMsg) {
  case WM_NCDESTROY:
    RemoveWindowSubclass(hwnd, EditSubclassProc, uIdSubclass);
    break;
  case WM_CHAR:
    if ((lParam &amp; 0x40000000) &amp;&amp; wParam != VK_BACK) return 0;
    break;
  }
    return DefSubclassProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}</font>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  ...
  <font color="blue">SetWindowSubclass(g_hwndChild, EditSubclassProc, 0, 0);</font>
  SetWindowFont(g_hwndChild, g_hfEdit, TRUE);
  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Bit 30 in the <code>lParam</code> of a
<code>WM_CHAR</code> message
says whether the key was already down.
If we see that bit set,
then we know that the message was an autorepeat
and we throw the message away.
(But I let the backspace key through because that lets me
erase a lot of text quickly.)
</p>
<p>
It’s important that the subclass procedure be removed before
the window is destroyed.
One way of doing this is to remove the subclass procedure
in the parent window’s
<code>WM_DESTROY</code> handler,
but since I don’t have one,
and I’m too lazy to make one,
I go for the alternate method of doing just-in-time deregistration
by removing the subclass procedure in the subclass procedure itself.
</p>
<p>
This version of the
program managed to keep my nieces happy for quite some time.
We’ll tinker with it some more next week.</p>
