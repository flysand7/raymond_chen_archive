<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does the CLR really call CoInitializeEx on the first call to unmanaged code, even if you don't deal with COM at all and are just calling native code via p/invoke?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Some time ago,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/08/11/10548975.aspx">
I called out</a>
this part of the documentation
regarding
managed and unmanaged threading:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
On the first call to unmanaged code,
the runtime calls <b>Co­Initialize­Ex</b>
to initialize the COM apartment as either an MTA or an STA apartment.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5s8ee185%28v=vs.71%29.aspx">
You can control the type of apartment created</a>
by setting the
System.Threading.ApartmentState property on the thread to <b>MTA</b>,
<b>STA</b>, or <b>Unknown</b>.
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Commenter T asks,
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/08/11/10548975.aspx#10549183">Does it do this even if you don’t deal with COM at all
and call native code through a P/Invoke</a>?”
</p>
<p>
Well, the documentation says it does, and we can confirm with an experiment:
</p>
<pre>
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
class Program
{
 public static void Main()
 {
  var thread = new System.Threading.Thread(
    () =&gt; {
   System.Console.WriteLine("about to p/invoke");
   GetTickCount();
  });
  thread.Start();
  thread.Join();
 }
 [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
 extern static uint GetTickCount();
}
</pre>
<p>
Run this program with a breakpoint on
<code>Co­InitializeEx</code>.
</p>
<p>
First breakpoint is hit with this stack:
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
This call is initializing the main thread of the process.
The flags passed to this first call to
<code>Co­Initialize­Ex</code> are 0,
which means that the default threading model of
<code>COINIT_MULTI­THREADED</code> is used.
</p>
<p>
The next time the breakpoint hits is with this stack:
</p>
<pre>

<p>
From the name <code>Finalizer­Thread­Start</code>,
this is clearly the finalizer thread.¹

<p>
Okay, this looks like it’s
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/12/10466467.aspx">
kicking off</a> a new thread.
I inferred this from the presence on the stack
of the function which is deviously named
<code>Kick­Off­Thread</code>.
</p>
<p>
And the flags passed to this call to
<code>Co­Initialize­Ex</code> are 0,
which once again means that it defaults to MTA.
</p>
<p>
There, we have confirmed experimentally that, at least in this case,
the implementation matches the documentation.
</p>
<p>
That the implementation behaves this way is not surprising.
After all, the CLR does not have insight into the
<code>Get­Tick­Count</code> function.
It does not know <i>a priori</i> whether that function will
create any COM objects.
After all, we could have been p/invoking to
<code>SHGet­Desktop­Folder</code>, which does use COM.
Given that the CLR cannot tell whether a native function is going
to use COM or not, it has to initialize COM just in case.
</p>
<p>
¹
Or somebody who is trying to mislead us into thinking that it is
the finalizer thread.
I tend to discount this theory because
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/01/31/10495737.aspx">
as a general rule, code is not intentionally written to be
impossible to understand</a>.</p>
