<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does the window manager adjust ptMaxSize and ptMaxPosition for multiple monitors?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There is a note down in the documentation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632605(v=vs.85).aspx">the <code>MIN­MAX­INFO</code> structure</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>For systems with multiple monitors, the <b>ptMaxSize</b> and <b>ptMaxPosition</b> members describe the maximized size and position of the window on the primary monitor, even if the window ultimately maximizes onto a secondary monitor. In that case, the window manager adjusts these values to compensate for differences between the primary monitor and the monitor that displays the window. </p></blockquote>
<p>People ask about the nature of this “compensation” and how they should deal with it. </p>
<p>When the window manager sends the <code>WM_GET­MIN­MAX­INFO</code> message to a top-level window, the <code>MIN­MAX­INFO</code> structure comes preinitialized with the following information: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Member</th>
<th>Initialized To</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxSize</b></td>
<td>The dimensions of the primary monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxPosition</b></td>
<td>The upper left corner of the window if it were     maximized on the primary monitor.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMinTrackSize</b></td>
<td>The minimum size the user can resize the window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxTrackSize</b></td>
<td>The maximum size the user can resize the window         (the union of all monitors, basically).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Two of these values are monitor-relative and are therefore subject to adjustment. </p>
<p><b>ptMax­Position</b> is easy. The point is moved to a corresponding relative position on the window’s actual monitor. </p>
<p><b>ptMax­Size</b> is trickier. If the specified size is greater than or equal to the size of the primary monitor, then the <b>ptMax­Size</b> is adjusted to include the difference in size between the primary monitor and the actual monitor. In other words, if <b>ptMax­Size</b> is 20 pixels larger than the primary monitor, then it will be adjusted to being 20 pixels larger than the actual monitor. But if <b>ptMax­Size</b> does not completely cover the monitor, then its value is used as-is. </p>
<p>That is what the documentation is referring to when it says “In that case.” The case is “if the window ultimately maximizes onto a secondary monitor.” </p>
<p>There is a bit of a gotcha here: If your window is larger than the screen in one direction but not another. For example, you may have a narrow maximum width but a tall maximum height. (Think console windows.) In that case, you will need to use <code>Monitor­From­Window</code> to get the parameters for the actual monitor so you can set your maximum height appropriately. </p>
<p>We’ll dig a little deeper into this gotcha next time. </p>
