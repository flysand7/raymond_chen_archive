<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The extern "C" specifier disables C++ mangling, but that doesn't mean it disables mangling</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3y1sfaz2.aspx"> MSDN documentation on dllexport</a> contains the following enigmatic paragraph, or at least did at the time I wrote this article:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>dllexport</b> of a C++ function will expose the function with C++ name mangling. If C++ name mangling is not desired, either use a .def file (EXPORTS keyword) or declare the function as extern “C”. </p></blockquote>
<p> I’ve seen this sentence misinterpreted as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>dllexport</b> of a C++ function will expose the function with C++ name mangling. <u>To disable name mangling</u> either use a .def file (EXPORTS keyword) or declare the function as extern “C”. </p></blockquote>
<p> This is an understandable misinterpretation, but it is still a misinterpretation.</p>
<p> The root cause of the misinterpretation is that the author of this documentation was wearing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/12/10163578.aspx"> C++-colored glasses</a>. In the author’s mind, there are only two interesting cases: </p>
<ol>
<li>C++ name mangling, where all the cool people are, and </li>
<li>everything else, for all the lamers. </li>
</ol>
<p> Here is a precise formulation of the paragraph: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>dllexport</b> of a C++ function will expose the function with C++ name mangling. If C++ name mangling is not desired, either use a .def file (EXPORTS keyword), <u>which will expose the name without mangling</u>, or declare the function as extern “C”, <u>which will expose the name with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/08/48616.aspx"> C mangling</a></u>. </p></blockquote>
<p> Here’s a version of the paragraph that tries to take away the C++-colored glasses. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>dllexport</b> exposes the function as it is decorated by the compiler. For example, if the function is a C++ function, it will be exposed with C++ name mangling. If the function is a C function, or has been declared as <code>extern "C"</code>, it will be exposed with C name mangling. To expose the function under its unmangled name (or to expose it via an alternate name), use use a .def file (EXPORTS keyword). </p></blockquote>
<p> <b>Behind the scenes</b>: To forestall nitpickers, I had to go back to my copy of the C++ standard to make sure I filled in the blank in “The <code>extern "C"</code> _________” correctly. Officially, <code>extern "C"</code> is a <i>storage class specifier</i>. </p>
