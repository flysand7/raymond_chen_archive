<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can’t I rotate the display with ChangeDisplaySettingsEx?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you have one of those cool swively LCD displays (or if you decided to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/rotate-or-pivot-lcd-monitor/"> build your own</a>), you naturally want to tell your video card to display rotated output, so you can take advantage of the portrait orientation. And naturally you would think that calling the <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code> and using the <code>dmDisplayOrientation</code> field of the <code>DEVMODE</code> structure would do the trick.</p>
<p> And then you would find that it doesn’t work. </p>
<p> Yet the annoying utility program (which gets shoveled onto your computer when you install the driver) can rotate the video output. How come they can do it, but <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code> can’t? </p>
<p> Because the video card vendor decided to do it in a nonstandard way so that you’re forced to use their annoying utility program. </p>
<p> I’m told that one of the requirements of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480220.aspx"> Windows Vista Display Driver Model</a> is that video drivers which support rotation must do so via the standard rotation interface. No “secret backdoor hidden rotation functionality” allowed. So at least things are getting better. </p>
<p> Of course, this doesn’t help if you have a video card that doesn’t have WDDM drivers. To the rescue come the clever people at EnTech, who developed the <a href="http://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm"> iRotate</a> utility which knows the secret backdoor way to convince these annoying video cards to do their rotation. </p>
