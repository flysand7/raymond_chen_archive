<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Enumerating all the ways of making change</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program enumerates all the ways of making
change for a particular amount given a set of available denominations.
</p>
<p>
The algorithm is straightforward.
To make change for a specific amount from a set of available
denominations,
you can take one denomination and decide
how many of those you want to use.
Then use the remaining denominations to make change for the remainder.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the available coins have values [1, 5, 10, 25]
and you want to make change for 60 cents, you first decide how many
25-cent pieces you want to use.
If you use none, then you need to make change for 60 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
If you use one, then you need to make change for 35 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
And if you use two, then you need to make change for 10 cents
using just [1, 5, 10].
</p>
<p>
(We use the largest coin first to reduce the number of dead ends,
like asking “Please make change for 83 cents using only 10-cent coins.”)
</p>
<pre>
function MakeChange(coins, total, f) {
 if (total == 0) { f([]); return; }
 if (coins.length == 0) return;
 var coin = coins[coins.length - 1];
 var remaining = coins.slice(0, -1);
 var used = [];
 for (var target = total; target &gt;= 0; target -= coin) {
  MakeChange(remaining, target, function(s) {
   f(used.concat(s));
  });
  used.push(coin);
 }
}
MakeChange([1, 5, 10, 25], 60, console.log.bind(console));
</pre>
<p>
First, we take care of some base cases.
To make change for zero cents, we simply use zero coins.
And it’s not possible to make
change for a nonzero amount with no coins.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, we take the highest denomination coin
and try using zero of them, then one of them, and so on,
until we exceed the total amount necessary.
</p>
<p>
There are related problems, such as determining whether
a particular amount of change can even be made, given a
collection of denominations
and calculating
<a href="http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Coin_Change">
the number of ways change can be made</a>
rather than enumerating them.
But I like enumeration problems.</p>
