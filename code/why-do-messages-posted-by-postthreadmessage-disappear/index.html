<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do messages posted by PostThreadMessage disappear?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The only thread message you can meaningfully post to a thread displaying UI is <code>WM_NULL</code>, and even then, it’s only because you want to wake up the message loop for some reason.
 A common problem I see is people who use <code>PostThreadMessage</code> to talk to a thread that is displaying UI and then wonder why the message never arrives.
 Oh, the message arrived all right. It arrived and then was thrown away.
 This is actually a repeat of an earlier entry with the title <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/26/412116.aspx"> <i>Thread messages are eaten by modal loops</i></a>, but I’m repeating it with a better subject line to help search engines.
 But since I’m here, I may as well augment the existing article.
 Obvious places where you have modal loops on a UI thread are functions that are explicitly modal like <code>DialogBox</code> or <code>MessageBox</code> or <code>TrackPopupMenuEx(TPM_RETURNCMD)</code> or <code>DoDragDrop</code>. But there are less obvious modal loops, like the modal loop that runs <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/20/535440.aspx"> when you click on the caption bar and hold the button</a> or the modal loop that runs when COM is waiting for a cross-thread call to complete.
 And since you don’t control those modal loops, when they call <code>DispatchMessage</code>, your thread message will simply be thrown away.</p>
<p> If you need to communicate reliably with a thread that also displays UI, then create a hidden window and send or post messages to that window. </p>
