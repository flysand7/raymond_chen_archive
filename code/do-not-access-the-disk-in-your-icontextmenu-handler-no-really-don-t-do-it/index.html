<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Do not access the disk in your IContextMenu handler, no really, don't do it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We saw some time ago that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/21/8525411.aspx">
the number one cause of crashes in Explorer is malware</a>.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that the number one cause of hangs in Explorer
is disk access from context menu handlers
(a special case of the more general principle,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/15/9549682.aspx">
you can’t open the file until the user tells you to open it</a>).
</p>
<p>
That’s why I was amused by Memet’s claim that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/05/9903476.aspx#9904591">
“would hit the disk” is not acceptable for me</a>.
The feedback I see from customers, either directly
from
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/05/28/9645162.aspx">
large multinational corporations with 500ms ping times</a>
or indirectly
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/04/10045651.aspx">
from individual users who collectively click <i>Send Report</i>
millions of times a day</a>,
is that “would hit the disk” ruins a lot of people’s days.
It may not be acceptable to you, but millions of other people
would beg to disagree.
</p>
<p>
The Windows team tries very hard to identify unwanted disk accesses
in Explorer and get rid of them.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/11/350628.aspx#350903">
We don’t get them all</a>, but at least we try.
But if the unwanted disk access is coming from a third-party add-on,
there isn’t much that can be done aside from saying,
“Don’t do that” and hoping the vendor listens.
</p>
<p>
Every so often, a vendor will come back and ask for advice on avoiding
disk access in their context menu handler.
There’s a lot of information packed into that data object that
contains information gathered from when the disk was accessed originally.
You can just retrieve that cached data instead of going off and
hitting the disk again to recalculate it.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to use a boring console application and the clipboard
rather than building a full
<code>IContext­Menu</code>,
since the purpose here is to show how to get data from a data object
without hitting the disk and not to delve into the details of
<code>IContext­Menu</code> implementation.
</p>

#define UNICODE

}

Okay, let’s say that we want to check that all the items
on the clipboard are files and not directories.
The <code>HDROP</code> way of doing this would be to get
the path to each of the items in the data object,
then call <code>Get­File­Attributes</code> on each one to see
if any of them has the
<code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY</code> flag set.
But this hits the disk, which makes baby context menu host sad.
Fortunately, the <code>IShell­Item­Array</code> interface provides
an easy way to check whether any or all the items in a data object
have a particular attribute.
</p>
<pre>
void ProcessDataObject(IDataObject *pdto)
{
 IShellItemArray *psia;
 HRESULT hr;
 hr = SHCreateShellItemArrayFromDataObject(pdto,
                                          IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psia));
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  SFGAOF sfgaoResult;
  hr = psia-&gt;GetAttributes(SIATTRIBFLAGS_OR, SFGAO_FOLDER,
                                                 &amp;sfgaoResult);
  if (hr == S_OK) {
   _tprintf(TEXT("Contains a folder\n"));
  } else if (hr == S_FALSE) {
   _tprintf(TEXT("Contains no folders\n"));
  }
  psia-&gt;Release();
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
In this case, we want to see if any item
(<code>SI­ATTRIB­FLAGS_OR</code>)
in the data object has
the <code>SFGAO_FOLDER</code> attribute.
The <code>IShell­Item­Array::Get­Attributes</code>
method returns
<code>S_OK</code> if all of the attributes you requested
are present in the result.
Since we asked for only one attribute, and since we asked for
the result to be the logical <i>or</i> of the individual attributes,
this means that it returns <code>S_OK</code> if any item is a folder.
</p>
<p>
Okay, fine, but what if the thing you want to know is not expressible
as a <code>SFGAO</code> flag?
Well, you can dig into each of the individual items.
For example, suppose we want to see the size of each item.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;strsafe.h&gt;
void ProcessDroppedObject(IDataObject *pdto)
{
 IShellItemArray *psia;
 HRESULT hr;
 hr = SHCreateShellItemArrayFromDataObject(pdto,
                                          IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psia));
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  <font color="blue">IEnumShellItems *pesi;
  hr = psia-&gt;EnumItems(&amp;pesi);
  if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
   IShellItem *psi;
   while (pesi-&gt;Next(1, &amp;psi, NULL) == S_OK) {
    IShellItem2 *psi2;
    hr = psi-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psi2));
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
     ULONGLONG ullSize;
     hr = psi2-&gt;GetUInt64(PKEY_Size, &amp;ullSize);
     if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
      _tprintf(TEXT("Item size is %I64u\n"), ullSize);
     }
     psi2-&gt;Release();
    }
    psi-&gt;Release();
   }
  }</font>
  psia-&gt;Release();
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
I went for <code>IEnum­Shell­Items</code> here,
even though a <code>for</code> loop
with <code>IShell­Item­Array::Get­Count</code> and
<code>IShell­Item­Array::Get­Item­At</code>
would have worked, too.
</p>
<p>
File system items in data objects cache a bunch of useful pieces
of information, such as the last-modified time, file creation time,
last-access time,
the file size,
the file attributes, and the file name (both long and short).
Of course, all of these properties are subject to file system support.
the shell just takes what’s in the <code>WIN32_FIND_DATA</code>;
if the values are incorrect
(for example, if last-access time tracking is disabled),
then the shell is going to cache the incorrect value.
But don’t say, “Well, if the cache is no good, then I won’t use it;
I’ll just go hit the disk”, because if you hit the disk,
the file system is going to give you the same incorrect value anyway!
</p>
<p>
If you just want to order the combo platter, you can ask for
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb760709.aspx">
<code>PKEY_Find­Data</code></a>, and out will come a
<code>WIN32_FIND_DATA</code>.
This might be the easiest way to convert your old-style context menu
that hits the disk into a new-style context menu that doesn’t hit the
disk:
Take your calls to
<code>Get­File­Attributes</code> and
<code>Find­First­File</code>
and convert them into calls into the property system,
asking for <code>PKEY_File­Attributes</code> or
<code>PKEY_Find­Data</code>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that’s the convenient modern way to get information that has
been cached in the data object provided by the shell.
What if you’re an old-school programmer?
Then you get to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with
the <code>CFSTR_SHELL­ID­LIST</code>
clipboard format.
(And if your target is Windows XP or earlier,
you have to do it this way since the
<code>IShell­Item­Array</code> interface
was not introduced until Windows Vista.)
In fact, the <code>CFSTR_SHELL­ID­LIST</code>
clipboard format will get your hands so dirty,
I’m writing a helper class to manage it.
</p>
<p>
First, go back and familiarize yourself with
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773212.aspx">
the <code>CIDA</code> structure</a>.
</p>
<pre>
// these should look familiar
#define HIDA_GetPIDLFolder(pida) (LPCITEMIDLIST)(((LPBYTE)pida)+(pida)-&gt;aoffset[0])
#define HIDA_GetPIDLItem(pida, i) (LPCITEMIDLIST)(((LPBYTE)pida)+(pida)-&gt;aoffset[i+1])
void ProcessDataObject(IDataObject *pdto)
{
 FORMATETC fmte = {
    (CLIPFORMAT)RegisterClipboardFormat(CFSTR_SHELLIDLIST),
    NULL, DVASPECT_CONTENT, -1, TYMED_HGLOBAL };
 STGMEDIUM stm = { 0 }; // defend against buggy data object
 HRESULT hr = pdto-&gt;GetData(&amp;fmte, &amp;stm);
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr) &amp;&amp; stm.hGlobal != NULL) {
  LPIDA pida = (LPIDA)GlobalLock(stm.hGlobal);
  if (pida != NULL) { // defend against buggy data object
   IShellFolder *psfRoot;
   hr = SHBindToObject(NULL, HIDA_GetPIDLFolder(pida), NULL,
                       IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psfRoot));
   if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
    for (UINT i = 0; i &lt; pida-&gt;cidl; i++) {
     IShellFolder2 *psf2;
     PCUITEMID_CHILD pidl;
     hr = SHBindToFolderIDListParent(psfRoot,
                HIDA_GetPIDLItem(pida, i),
                IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psf2), &amp;pidl);
     if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
      VARIANT vt;
      if (SUCCEEDED(psf2-&gt;GetDetailsEx(pidl, &amp;PKEY_Size, &amp;vt))) {
       if (SUCCEEDED(VariantChangeType(&amp;vt, &amp;vt, 0, VT_UI8))) {
         _tprintf(TEXT("Item size is %I64u\n"), vt.ullVal);
       }
       VariantClear(&amp;vt);
      }
      psf2-&gt;Release();
     }
    }
    psfRoot-&gt;Release();
   }
   GlobalUnlock(stm.hGlobal);
  }
  ReleaseStgMedium(&amp;stm);
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
I warned you it was going to be ugly.
</p>
<p>
First, we retrieve the <code>CFSTR_SHELL­ID­LIST</code> clipboard
format from the data object.
This format takes the form of an <code>HGLOBAL</code>,
which needs to be <code>Global­Lock</code>‘d
like all <code>HGLOBAL</code>s
returned by <code>IData­Object::Get­Data</code>.
You may notice two defensive measures here.
First, there is a defense against data objects which return
success when they actually failed.
To detect this case, we zero out the <code>STG­MEDIUM</code> and
make sure they returned something non-<code>NULL</code> in it.
The second defensive measure is against data objects which
put an invalid <code>HGLOBAL</code> in the <code>STG­MEDIUM</code>.
One of the nice things about doing things the
<code>IShell­Item­Array</code> way is that the shell default
implementation of <code>IShell­Item­Array</code> has all these
defensive measures built-in so you don’t have to write them yourself.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, once we get the <code>CIDA</code>,
we bind to the folder portion, walk through the items,
and get the size of each item in order to print it.
Same story, different words.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>: Why did we need a separate defensive measure
for data objects which returned success but left garbage in the
<code>STG­MEDIUM</code>?
Why doesn’t the <code>Global­Lock</code> test cover that case, too?</p>
