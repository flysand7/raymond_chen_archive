<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do some structures end with an array of size 1?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Some Windows structures are variable-sized,
beginning with a fixed header, followed by
a variable-sized array.  When these structures
are declared,
they often declare an array of size 1 where the
variable-sized array should be.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct _TOKEN_GROUPS {
    DWORD GroupCount;
    SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES Groups[ANYSIZE_ARRAY];
} TOKEN_GROUPS, *PTOKEN_GROUPS;
</pre>
<p>
If you look in the header files, you’ll see that ANYSIZE_ARRAY is
#define’d to 1, so this declares a structure with a trailing array
of size one.
</p>
<p>
With this declaration, you would allocate memory for one such
variable-sized TOKEN_GROUPS structure like this:
</p>
<pre>
PTOKEN_GROUPS TokenGroups =
   malloc(FIELD_OFFSET(TOKEN_GROUPS, Groups[NumberOfGroups]));
</pre>
and you would initialize the structure like this:
<pre>
TokenGroups-&gt;GroupCount = NumberOfGroups;
for (DWORD Index = 0; Index = NumberOfGroups; Index++) {
  TokenGroups-&gt;Groups[Index] = …;
}
</pre>
<p>
Many people think it should have been declared like this:
</p>
<pre>
<i>typedef struct _TOKEN_GROUPS {
    DWORD GroupCount;
} TOKEN_GROUPS, *PTOKEN_GROUPS;</i>
</pre>
<p>
(In this article, code that is wrong or hypothetical
will be italicized.)
</p>
<p>
The code that does the allocation would then go like this:
</p>
<pre>
<i>PTOKEN_GROUPS TokenGroups =
   malloc(sizeof(TOKEN_GROUPS) +
          NumberOfGroups * sizeof(SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES));</i>
</pre>
<p>
This alternative has two disadvantages, one cosmetic and one fatal.
</p>
<p>
First, the cosmetic disadvantage:
It makes it harder to access the variable-sized data.
Initializing the <i>TOKEN_GROUPS</i> just allocated would go like this:
</p>
<pre>
<i>TokenGroups-&gt;GroupCount = NumberOfGroups;
for (DWORD Index = 0; Index = NumberOfGroups; Index++) {
  ((SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES *)(TokenGroups + 1))[Index] = …;
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
The real disadvantage is fatal.
The above code <strong>crashes</strong> on 64-bit Windows.
The SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES structure looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct _SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES {
    PSID Sid;
    DWORD Attributes;
    } SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES, * PSID_AND_ATTRIBUTES;
</pre>
<p>
Observe that the first member of this structure is a pointer,
PSID.  The SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES structure requires pointer alignment,
which on 64-bit Windows is 8-byte alignment.
On the other hand, the proposed <i>TOKEN_GROUPS</i> structure
consists of just a DWORD and therefore requires only 4-byte alignment.
<i>sizeof(TOKEN_GROUPS)</i> is four.
</p>
<p>
I hope you see where this is going.
</p>
<p>
Under the proposed structure definition,
the array of SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES
structures will <strong>not</strong> be placed on an 8-byte
boundary but only on a 4-byte boundary.
The necessary padding between the GroupCount and the first
SID_AND_ATTRIBUTES is missing.
The attempt to access the elements of the array will crash with a
STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT exception.
</p>
<p>
Okay, you may say, then why not use a zero-length array instead
of a 1-length array?
</p>
<p>
Because time travel has yet to be perfected.
</p>
<p>
Zero-length arrays did not become legal Standard C until 1999.
Since Windows was around long before then, it could not take
advantage of that functionality in the C language.
