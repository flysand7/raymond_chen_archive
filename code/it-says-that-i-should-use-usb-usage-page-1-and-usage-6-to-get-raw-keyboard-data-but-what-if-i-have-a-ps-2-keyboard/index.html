<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It says that I should use USB usage page 1 and usage 6 to get raw keyboard data, but what if I have a PS/2 keyboard?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I wrote about raw input and noted that if you want to receive raw keyboard input, you set the usage page to 1 and the usage to 6, noting that these numbers come from the USB HID specification. Commenter onodera asks, “<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/#comment-1255025">Does this work for PS/2 input devices as well</a>?” </p>
<p>Let’s try it. I happen to have a laptop within easy reach, so I plugged in an external USB wireless keyboard, then went to Device Manager. It says </p>

<p>Then I ran <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">the sample raw keyboard input program from the same article</a> and pressed the space bar a few times on the external USB wireless keyboard, then the space bar a few times on the built-in PS/2 keyboard: </p>

0001003D, msg=0101, vk=0020, scanCode=39, release

<p>The entries from device <code>04E00817</code> are from the external USB wireless keyboard. The entries from device <code>0001003D</code> are from the built-in PS/2 keyboard. </p>
<p>So there you go: It works even for PS/2 keyboards. </p>
<p>The fact that the input is described in terms of HID usage pages and HID usages is just a convenient way of expressing what kind of input you want, because it generalizes in the obvious way to to HID devices. Non-HID devices are mapped to the corresponding HID usages. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Raw input also captures synthesized input. Here’s the result after performing a <code>Send­Input</code> to simulate pressing the space bar: </p>
<pre>
00000000, msg=0100, vk=0020, scanCode=39, press
00000000, msg=0101, vk=0020, scanCode=39, release
</pre>
<p>Notice that this was a completely synthetic keypress, but it showed up anyway, despite not having come from a USB device (or indeed any device at all). Note also that the device handle is null. </p>
