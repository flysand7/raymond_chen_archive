<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An introduction to COM connection points</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/10/10424662.aspx">
Last time</a>,
we saw how to enumerate all the Internet Explorer and
Explorer Windows and see what they are viewing.
But that program printed static information.
It didn’t track the changes to the windows if the user
clicked to another Web page or navigated to a different folder.
</p>
<p>
In order to hook that up, we
need to understand the connection point model and the
way events are expressed in dispatch interfaces.
First, let’s look at the connection point model.
These topics confused me when I first met them
(in part because I didn’t do a good job of mentally
separating them into two topics and instead treated it
as one big topic),
so I’m going to spend a few days
trying to explain how it works,
and then later this week, we’ll actually hook things up.
(And actually hooking it up is a lot easier than explaining it.)
</p>
<p>
Today, the connection point model.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have a widget which can have multiple clients.
The clients can communicate with the widget by invoking methods
on the widget, like
<code>IWidget::Set­Color</code>.
but how does the widget communicate with its clients?
Well, since this is COM, the first thing you need is an interface,
say,
<code>IWidget­Client</code>.
The idea is that each client implements
<code>IWidget­Client</code>,
and when the widget needs to, say, notify each client that
the color changed,
it can invoke
<code>IWidget­Client::On­Color­Changed</code>
on each one.
Each client can register with the widget for notifications.
</p>
<p>
The COM interface for standardizing the registration mechanism
is <code>IConnection­Point</code>.
A <i>connection point</i>
acts as a middle-man between
the widget and all its clients:
Whenever the widget needs to notify all its clients,
it tells the connection point to do it.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="To the left is the widget. An arrow goes from the widget to the connection point in the center. Three arrows go from the connection point to clients A, B, and C on the right.">
<tr>

    Client A</td>

<tr style="height: 1ex">

<td align="center" style="border: solid black .75pt;padding: 3pt">
    Client B</td>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>→</td>
<td align="center" style="border: solid black .75pt;padding: 3pt">
    Client C</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
A client registers with a connection point by calling
<code>IConnection­Point::Advise</code>,
and it unregisters by calling
<code>IConnection­Point::Unadvise</code>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that’s great,
but how do clients find the connection point so they can register with it?
</p>
<p>
The widget exposes an interface known as
<code>IConnection­Point­Container</code>
which provides access to an object’s connection points.
The client can call the
<code>IConnection­Point­Container::Find­Connection­Point</code> method
to get access to a specific connection point.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how the pieces fit together:
</p>
<pre>
// error checking elided for expository purposes</pre></tr></table></p>
<p>void IUnknown_FindConnectionPoint(IUnknown *punk,
                                  REFIID riid,
                                  IConnectionPoint **ppcp)
{
 // get the IConnectionPointContainer interface
 CComQIPtr&lt;IConnectionPointContainer&gt; spcpc(punk);</p>
<p> // Locate the connection point
 spcpc-&gt;FindConnectionPoint(riid,  ppcp);
}</p>
<p>class CClient : public IWidgetClient
{
…
 IWidget *m_pWidget;
 DWORD m_dwCookie;
};</p>
<p>CClient::RegisterWidgetClient()
{
 // Find the IWidgetClient connection point
 CComPtr&lt;IConnectionPoint&gt; spcp;
 IUnknown_FindConnectionPoint(m_pWidget,
                              IID_IWidgetClient, &amp;spcp);</p>
<p> // register with it
 spcp-&gt;Advise(this, &amp;m_dwCookie);
}</p>
<p>CClient::UnregisterWidgetClient()
{
 // Find the IWidgetClient connection point
 CComPtr&lt;IConnectionPoint&gt; spcp;
 IUnknown_FindConnectionPoint(m_pWidget,
                              IID_IWidgetClient, &amp;spcp);</p>
<p> // unregister from it
 spcp-&gt;Unadvise(m_dwCookie);
}

<p>
After registering as a widget client,
the <code>CClient</code> object will receive
method calls on its <code>IWidget­Client</code>
until it unregisters.
</p>
<p>
Now the widget and clients have two-way communication.
If the clients want to initiate the communuication,
it can call a method on <code>IWidget</code>.
If the widget wants to initiate the communication,
it can call a method on <code>IWidget­Client</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that we’ve created a giant circular reference.
The widget has a reference to its connection point
(so it can tell it to fire a notification to all its clients),
and the connection point has a reference to the widget
client
(so it can forward the notification along),
and the widget client has a reference to the widget
in its <code>m_pWidget</code> member.
In order to break this cycle,
you have to remember to explicitly call
<code>Unregister­Widget­Client</code>
when you are no longer interested in receiving
widget notifications.
</p>
<p>
Note that even though the arrows in the diagram above
flow from left to right (from widget to clients),
that doesn’t mean that the
information flow is strictly left-to-right.
You can pass information in the other direction
via return values or output parameters.
</p>
<p>
For example, there might be a method on
the <code>IWidget­Client</code> interface
called <code>Get­Color</code>:
</p>
<pre>
interface IWidgetClient : IUnknown
{
 …
 HRESULT GetColor([out] COLORREF *pclr);
 …
};
</pre>
<p>
Since there can be multiple clients, the widget
needs to have some sort of rule for deciding which
client gets to choose the color.
It might decide to ask each client in turn for a color,
until one of them returns <code>S_OK</code>,
and that client’s color is used and no further clients
are notified.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe there’s a method called
<code>On­Save</code>:
</p>
<pre>
interface IWidgetClient : IUnknown
{
 …
 HRESULT OnSave([in] IPropertyStorage *pps);
 …
};
</pre>
<p>
The convention here might be that all clients
will be notified of the Save operation and they
can write any additional information to the
<code>IProperty­Storage</code> while handing
the notification.
</p>
<p>
Those are just examples.
Feel free to make up your own.
The point is that just because the arrows go from the
widget to the clients doesn’t mean that information
can’t flow back the other way.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time, you have the simple case where
a widget will expose a single connection point.
In that case, the generality of the
<code>IConnection­Point­Container</code>
may seem unnecessary.
But it allows you to add new connection points later.
For example, you might have multiple client interfaces
for different types of clients.
You could have
<code>IWidget­Color­Client</code>
for clients that are interested only in color changes,
and
<code>IWidget­Network­Client</code>
for clients that are interested only in monitoring the
widget’s network activity.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe you didn’t plan on having multiple connection points
originally,
but in the second version of your product,
you want to add additional methods to
<code>IWidget­Client</code>,
so you need to create
<code>IWidget­Client2</code>,
which means that you also need a new connection point for it.
</p>
<p>
Next time, a look at the special case where
the client interface is a dispatch interface.
