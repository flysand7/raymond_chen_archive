<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you try to declare a variadic function with an incompatible calling convention, the compiler secretly converts it to cdecl</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Consider the following function on an x86 system:
</p>
<pre>
void __stdcall something(char *, ...);
</pre>
<p>
The function declares itself as <code>__stdcall</code>,
which is a callee-clean convention.
But a variadic function cannot be callee-clean since the callee
does not know how many parameters were passed,
so it doesn’t know how many it should clean.
</p>
<p>
The Microsoft Visual Studio C/C++ compiler resolves this conflict
by silently converting the calling convention to <code>__cdecl</code>,
which is the only supported variadic calling convention
for functions that do not take a hidden <code>this</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>
Why does this conversion take place silently rather than generating
a warning or error?
</p>
<p>
My guess is that it’s to make the compiler options
<code>/Gr</code> (set default calling convention to <code>__fastcall</code>)
and
<code>/Gz</code> (set default calling convention to <code>__stdcall</code>)
less annoying.
</p>
<p>
Automatic conversion of variadic functions to <code>__cdecl</code>
means that you can just add the <code>/Gr</code> or <code>/Gz</code>
command line switch to your compiler options, and everything will
still compile and run (just with the new calling convention).
</p>
<p>
Another way of looking at this is not by thinking of the compiler
as converting variadic <code>__stdcall</code> to <code>__cdecl</code>
but rather by simply saying
“for variadic functions, <code>__stdcall</code> is caller-clean.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
How can you determine which interpretation is what the compiler actually does?
In other words, is it the case that the compiler converts
<code>__stdcall</code> to <code>__cdecl</code> for variadic functions,
or is it the case that the calling convention for variadic
<code>__stdcall</code> functions is caller-clean?</p>
