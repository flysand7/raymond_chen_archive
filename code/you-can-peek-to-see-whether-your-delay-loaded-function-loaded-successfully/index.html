<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can peek to see whether your delay-loaded function loaded successfully</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt403328(v=vs.85).aspx">The <code>Query­Optional­Delay­Loaded­API</code> function</a> lets you ask whether a function marked as delay-loaded was in fact found. Here’s a tiny demonstration: </p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;commdlg.h&gt;
#include &lt;libloaderapi2.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

EXTERN_C IMAGE_DOS_HEADER <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">__ImageBase</a>;
#define HMODULE_THISCOMPONENT reinterpret_cast&lt;HMODULE&gt;(&amp;__ImageBase)

int __cdecl main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    if (QueryOptionalDelayLoadedAPI(HMODULE_THISCOMPONENT,
          "comdlg32.dll", "GetOpenFileNameW", 0))
    {
        printf("GetOpenFileNameW can be called!\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This gives you function-by-function granularity on checking whether a delay-loaded function was successfully loaded, which is an improvement over <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8yfshtha.aspx">being told whether all the imports for a DLL were loaded</a>. </p>
<p>Note also that the original problem with the Win16 model for weak linking wasn’t that <a href="https://twitter.com/rosyna/status/710650988034568192">developers built but never ran their programs</a>. Developers built their programs, and they ran fine on all the systems they tested because the function was present on all the systems they tested. <i>It never occurred to them that the function might not exist in the first place</i>. I mean, suppose you wrote a 16-bit program that called <code>Get­Open­File­Name</code>. It runs great on all your systems! But oh no, you get a report from a customer that it crashes on their system. The reason: <code>COMMDLG.DLL</code> was not a mandatory OS component. Users had the option of installing Windows without it, at which point all the programs that called <code>Get­Open­File­Name</code> would start crashing. </p>
<p>Win32’s response to this was “If you want weak linking, <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/I/If-you-want-X--you-know-where-to-find-it-.html">you know where to find it</a>.” Namely, <code>Get­Proc­Address</code>. The fact that you called a function to get an address will hopefully remind you to check whether the function actually succeeded. </p>
<p>The introduction of the <code>Query­Optional­Delay­Loaded­API</code> function is to allow Store apps (which are not allowed by policy to call <code>Load­Library</code>) to detect whether their delay-loaded function actually got loaded. The fact that the requested functions are in the delay-loaded function table means that a static analysis can still find all the functions that the program could potentially call. </p>
