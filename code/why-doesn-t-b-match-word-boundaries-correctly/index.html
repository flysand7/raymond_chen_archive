<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't b match word boundaries correctly?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A colleague of mine was having trouble getting the <code>\b</code> metacharacter in a regular expression to work. Of course, when somebody asks a question like that, you first have to establish what their definition of “work” is. Fortunately, he provided some examples:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("foo", @"\b" + @"foo" + @"\b")</code></td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("%1" , @"\b" + @"%1"  + @"\b")</code></td>
<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("%1" , @"\b" + @"\%1" + @"\b")</code></td>
<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("%1" , @"\b" + @"\%1" + @"\b")</code></td>
<td>false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("%1" , @"..")</code></td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Regex.IsMatch("%1" , @"%1")</code></td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> “The last two entries are just sanity checks to make sure I didn’t make some stupid mistake like passing the parameters in the wrong order. I want to search for a string that contains <tt>%1</tt> with word boundaries on either side, something I would normally use <tt>\b</tt> for. Is there something special about the % character? Notice that the match succeeds when I look for the word <tt>foo</tt>.”
 Everything is working as it should. Recall that the <tt>\b</tt> metacharacter matches when there is a <tt>\w</tt> on one side and a <tt>\W</tt> on the other, where the beginning and end of the string are treated as if they were <tt>\W</tt>.
 The string <tt>%1</tt> therefore breaks down as</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td align="right">virtual <tt>\W</tt></td>
<td> beginning of string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right"><tt>\W</tt></td>
<td> % is not an alphanumeric or _</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right"><tt>\w</tt></td>
<td> 1 is a digit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">virtual <tt>\W</tt></td>
<td> end of string</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> The only points where <tt>\b</tt> would match are immediately before and after the 1, since those are the transition points between <tt>\w</tt> and <tt>\W</tt> and vice versa. In particular, the location immediately before the percent sign does not match since it is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/09/23/9898231.aspx"> surrounded</a> by <tt>\W</tt> on both sides.</p>
<p> My colleague responded, “D’oh! I keep forgetting that % won’t act like a <tt>\w</tt> just because I want it to.” </p>
