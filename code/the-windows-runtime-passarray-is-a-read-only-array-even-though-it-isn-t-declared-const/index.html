<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Windows Runtime PassArray is a read-only array, even though it isn’t declared <code>const</code></h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As I noted some time ago, <a href="/code/the-various-patterns-for-passing-c-style-arrays-across-the-windows-runtime-abi-boundary" title="The various patterns for passing C-style arrays across the Windows Runtime ABI boundary"> the Windows Runtime PassArray pattern passes a read-only non-owning counted array which is nevertheless not declared as <code>const</code></a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you try to force the array type to be <code>const</code> in your IDL declaration:</p>
<pre>HRESULT SetData([in] UINT32 dataSize, [in, size_is(dataSize)] <u>const</u> INT32* data);
</pre>
<p>The <code>const</code> is ignored, and the resulting metadata declares the parameter as non-<code>const</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this, partly intentional, and partly a technicality.</p>
<p>The technicality is that the <code>const</code> attribute is lost because Windows Runtime methods are described by metadata that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/xlang/blob/master/docs/xplatwinrt/XSPEC02%20-%20Metadata%20Representation.md"> physically takes the form of an ECMA-335 assembly</a> (though restricted to a very limited subset of full ECMA-335), and ECMA-335 does not have <code>const</code>. Therefore Windows Runtime metadata cannot have <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is an unsatisfying explanation since it’s <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/25e0/index.htm" title="Unicode Character 'UPPER HALF CIRCLE' (U+25E0)"> semi-circular</a>. Windows Runtime metadata doesn’t have <code>const</code> because the designers chose a format that doesn’t support <code>const</code>, and it’s okay to have chosen a format that doesn’t support <code>const</code> because Windows Runtime metadata doesn’t use <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>But really, if they really wanted <code>const</code>, then they would have chosen some other file format that <i>does</i> support <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>The Windows Runtime does not have <code>const</code> because the concept cannot be expressed in most programming languages,¹ and the Windows Runtime intends to be language-independent. Limiting the feature set of the Windows Runtime type system makes it more likely that it can be consumed by a broad range of programming languages.</p>
<p>¹ Indeed, it’s really only C, C++ and now Rust that have such a concept. The C++ projections do represent the array as <code>const</code>: It is a <code>const Platform::<wbr/>Array</code> in C++/CX, and it is a <code>winrt::<wbr/>array_view&lt;T const&gt;</code> in C++/WinRT. Similarly, the Rust projection represents the array as an immutable reference.</p>
