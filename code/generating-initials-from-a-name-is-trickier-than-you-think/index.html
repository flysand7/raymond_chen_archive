<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Generating initials from a name is trickier than you think</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Even though I’m signed in, the page claims that anonymous comments are not allowed, so I’m reduced to posting my comment here and generating a trackback. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2006/10/16/Get-Initials-from-a-String-in-VB.NET.aspx"> Some time ago, Robert McLaws wrote a function that generates initials from a name</a>. Let’s set aside completely the issue of non-U.S. names; the function doesn’t even handle U.S. names correctly. </p>
<p> Given <i>Cal Ripken, Jr.</i>, the function comes up with the initials <i>JCR</i>, which is decidedly suboptimal. </p>
