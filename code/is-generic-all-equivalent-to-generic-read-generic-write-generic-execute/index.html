<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is GENERIC_ALL equivalent to GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_EXECUTE?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know whether passing <code>GENERIC_ALL</code> as an access mask is effectively equivalent to passing <code>GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_EXECUTE</code>. Specifically, they were interested in the answer to this question with respect to the <code>Create­File</code> function. </p>
<p>Okay, first question first. Is <code>GENERIC_ALL</code> effectively equivalent to <code>GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_EXECUTE</code>? </p>
<p>The answer is “It depends.” </p>
<p>Each object decides what these generic access masks mean. Now, the intended use is that <code>GENERIC_READ</code> correspond to whatever “read” access means for an object, <code>GENERIC_WRITE</code> correspond to whatever “write” access means for an object, and <code>GENERIC_EXECUTE</code> correspond to whatever “execute” access means for an object. It’s also the intended use that <code>GENERIC_ALL</code> represent whatever access makes the most sense for “all access”. </p>
<p>But that’s just the intended use. There is nothing physically preventing an object from giving those four generic access masks nonsensical values. Because <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=20733">anybody can make up a generic mapping</a>. Therefore, there’s nothing you can guarantee about the relationship between the generic access masks beyond “they are what the object decides they are.” </p>
<p>In practice, <code>GENERIC_ALL</code> is at least as big as <code>GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_EXECUTE</code>, but it can be bigger. For example, for files (which is probably what the customer is asking about when they talk about <code>Create­File</code>), the values are defined as follows, in <code>winnt.h</code>: </p>

<p>Right off the bat, you can see that of the standard rights, <code>FILE_ALL_ACCESS</code> includes <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>, whereas the <code>FILE_GENERIC_*</code> values include only <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_*</code>, all of which are defined as <code>READ_CONTROL</code>. This means that <code>FILE_ALL_ACCESS</code> includes <code>DELETE</code>, <code>WRITE_DAC</code>, and <code>WRITE_OWNER</code> which are not included in any of the other generic access masks. (<code>SYNCHRONIZE</code> is explicitly added by all of the <code>FILE_GENERIC_*</code> access masks.) </p>
<p>If you study it a bit more, you’ll see that <code>FILE_ALL_ACCESS</code> also includes <code>FILE_DELETE_CHILD</code>, which is not present in any of the other generic access masks. </p>
<p>So even in the specific case of file access, we see that <code>GENERIC_ALL</code> is not equivalent to <code>GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE | GENERIC_EXECUTE</code>. </p>
