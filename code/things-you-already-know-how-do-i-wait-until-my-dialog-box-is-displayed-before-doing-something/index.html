<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Things you already know: How do I wait until my dialog box is displayed before doing something?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One customer wanted to wait until the dialog box was displayed
before displaying its own dialog box.
(Personally, I think immediately displaying
a doubly-nested dialog box counts as starting off on the wrong foot
from a usability standpoint,
but let’s set that issue aside for now.)
The customer discovered that displaying the nested dialog box
in response to the <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code> message was premature,
because as we all know,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/11/87941.aspx">
the <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code> is sent
before the dialog box is displayed</a>.
The question therefore is,
“How do I want until my dialog box is displayed before doing something?”
</p>
<p>
One proposed solution was the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
case WM_INITDIALOG:
    PostMessage(hDlg, WM_APP, 0, 0);
    return TRUE;
case WM_APP:
    ... display the second dialog ...
    break;
</pre>

<li>Why is this wrong?
    Hint: You definitely know the answer to this already.
<li>What is the correct solution?
    You probably know this already.
