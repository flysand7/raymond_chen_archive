<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I GetProcAddress for CreateWindow?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Occasionally, I’ll see people having trouble trying to
<code>GetProcAddress</code> for functions like
<code>CreateWindow</code> or <code>ExitWindows</code>.
Usually, it’s coming from people who are
trying to write p/invoke signatures,
for p/invoke does a <code>GetProcAddress</code> under the covers.
Why can’t you <code>GetProcAddress</code> for these functions?
</p>
<p>
Because they’re not really functions.
They’re function-like macros:
</p>
<pre>
#define CreateWindowA(lpClassName, lpWindowName, dwStyle, x, y,\
nWidth, nHeight, hWndParent, hMenu, hInstance, lpParam)\
CreateWindowExA(0L, lpClassName, lpWindowName, dwStyle, x, y,\
nWidth, nHeight, hWndParent, hMenu, hInstance, lpParam)
#define CreateWindowW(lpClassName, lpWindowName, dwStyle, x, y,\
nWidth, nHeight, hWndParent, hMenu, hInstance, lpParam)\
CreateWindowExW(0L, lpClassName, lpWindowName, dwStyle, x, y,\
nWidth, nHeight, hWndParent, hMenu, hInstance, lpParam)
#ifdef UNICODE
#define CreateWindow  CreateWindowW
#else
#define CreateWindow  CreateWindowA
#endif // !UNICODE
#define ExitWindows(dwReserved, Code) ExitWindowsEx(EWX_LOGOFF, 0xFFFFFFFF)
</pre>
<p>
In fact, as you can see above <code>CreateWindow</code> is doubly
a macro.
First, it’s a redirecting macro
that expands to either <code>CreateWindowA</code>
or <code>CreateWindowW</code>, depending on whether or not you are compiling
<code>UNICODE</code>.
Those are in turn function-like macros that call the real
function <code>CreateWindowExA</code> or <code>CreateWindowExW</code>.
All this is handled by the compiler if you include the
<code>winuser.h</code> header file,
but if for some reason you want to <code>GetProcAddress</code>
for a function-like macro like <code>CreateWindow</code>, you’ll have
to manually expand the macro to see what the real function is
and pass that function name to <code>GetProcAddress</code>.
</p>
<p>
Similar remarks apply to inline functions.
These functions can’t be obtained via <code>GetProcAddress</code>
because they aren’t exported at all; they are provided to you
as source code in the header file.
</p>
<p>
Note that whether something is a true function or a function-like
macro (or an inline function) can depend on your target platform.
For example, <code>GetWindowLongPtrA</code> is a true exported
function on 64-bit Windows, but on 32-bit Windows,
it’s just a macro that resolves
to <code>GetWindowLongA</code>.
As another example,
the <code>Interlocked</code> family of functions are
exported functions on the x86 version of Windows but are
inlined functions on all other Windows architectures.
</p>
<p>
How can you figure all this out?
Read the header files.
That’ll show you whether the function you want is a
redirecting macro,
a function-like macro,
an inline function,
an intrinsic function,
or a proper exported function.
If you can’t figure it out from the header files, you can always
just write a program that calls the function you’re interested in
and then look at the disassembly to see what actually got generated.</p>
