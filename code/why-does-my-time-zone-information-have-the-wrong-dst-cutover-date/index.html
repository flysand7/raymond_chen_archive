<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does my TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION have the wrong DST cutover date?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Public Service Announcement: Daylight Saving Time begins in most parts of the United States this weekend. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/05/10086404.aspx#10086843"> Other parts of the world may change on a different day from the United States</a>.
 A customer reported that they were getting incorrect values from the <code>GetTimeZoneInformationForYear</code> function.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I have a program that calls <code>GetTimeZoneInformationForYear</code>, and it looks like it’s returning incorrect DST transition dates. For example, <code>GetTimeZoneInformationForYear(2010, NULL, &amp;tzi)</code> is returning March 2nd as the tzi.DaylightDate value, instead of the Expected March 14th date. The current time zone is Pacific Time. </p></blockquote>
<p> The value returned by <code>GetTimeZoneInformationForYear</code> (and <code>GetTimeZoneInformation</code>) is correct; you’re just reading it wrong.
 As called out in the documentation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms725481.aspx"> the <code>TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION</code> structure</a>, the <code>wDay</code> field in the <code>StandardDate</code> and <code>DaylightDate</code> changes meaning depending on whether the <code>wYear</code> is zero or nonzero.
 If the <code>wYear</code> is nonzero, then the <code>wDay</code> has its usual meaning.
 But if the <code>wYear</code> is zero (and it is for most time zones), then the <code>wDay</code> encodes the <i>week number</i> of the cutover rather than the day number.</p>
<p> In other words, that 2 does not mean “March 2nd”. It means “the second week in March”. </p>
