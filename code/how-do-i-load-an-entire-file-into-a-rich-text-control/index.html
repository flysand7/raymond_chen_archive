<p>
To load an entire file into a rich text control, you can use
the <code>EM_STREAMIN</code> message,
which accepts an <code>IStream</code> of data all at once.
Once you find the message, it’s pretty straightforward how to use it,
but I’ll write out the code anyway;
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK EditStreamCallback(DWORD_PTR dwCookie, LPBYTE lpBuff,
                                  LONG cb, PLONG pcb)
{
 HANDLE hFile = (HANDLE)dwCookie;
 return !ReadFile(hFile, lpBuff, cb, (DWORD *)pcb, NULL);
}
BOOL FillRichEditFromFile(HWND hwnd, LPCTSTR pszFile)
{
 BOOL fSuccess = FALSE;
 HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(pszFile, GENERIC_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ,
                           0, OPEN_EXISTING,
                           FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN, NULL);
 if (hFile != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
  EDITSTREAM es = { (DWORD_PTR)hFile, 0, EditStreamCallback };
  if (SendMessage(hwnd, EM_STREAMIN, SF_RTF, (LPARAM)&amp;es) &amp;&amp;
      es.dwError == 0) {
   fSuccess = TRUE;
  }
  CloseHandle(hFile);
 }
 return fSuccess;
}
</pre>
<p>
You pretty much follow your nose.
The <code>EM_STREAMIN</code> message wants you
to tell it the format of the stream (<code>SF_RTF</code>)
and provide a pointer to an <code>EDITSTREAM</code> structure
that controls the input.
Since we want to read from a file, we open a file for reading
and use it as the <code>dwCookie</code> for
our <code>EditStreamCallback</code>.
The only tricky part is getting the return value correct for the
callback.
For some reason, the rich edit control wants zero on success and
nonzero on failure, so we need to flip the sense of the
<code>ReadFile</code> return value accordingly.
Aside from that, there’s nothing particularly interesting going on.
</p>
<p>
“But I tried this, and only the first line of the file gets read in.
What am I doing wrong?”
</p>

<p>Ah, a classic rookie mistake.
You forgot to set the <code>ES_MULTILINE</code> style when you created
the rich edit control.
</p>
<p>
Don’t worry, I made this mistake, too.
</p>
<p>
“What if my data is in some other format than a file?”
</p>
<p>
As long as you can write a function that produces the next few bytes
of data,
you can stream it into a rich edit control.
For example, here’s a version that loads an arbitrary <code>IStream</code>
into a rich edit control:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK EditStreamCallback(DWORD_PTR dwCookie, LPBYTE lpBuff,
                                  LONG cb, PLONG pcb)
{
 IStream *pstm = (IStream *)dwCookie;
 return FAILED(pstm-&gt;Read(lpBuff, cb, (ULONG*)pcb));
}
BOOL FillRichEditFromStream(HWND hwnd, IStream *pstm)
{
 BOOL fSuccess = FALSE;
 EDITSTREAM es = { (DWORD_PTR)pstm, 0, EditStreamCallback };
 if (SendMessage(hwnd, EM_STREAMIN, SF_RTF, (LPARAM)&amp;es) &amp;&amp;
     es.dwError == 0) {
  fSuccess = TRUE;
 }
 return fSuccess;
}
</pre>
<p>
There’s still a bug in this code, however,
and it’s not where you expect it.
We’ll take another look next time.</p>
