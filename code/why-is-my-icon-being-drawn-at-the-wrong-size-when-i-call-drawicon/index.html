<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is my icon being drawn at the wrong size when I call DrawIcon?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Some time ago I had a problem with icon drawing.
When I tried to draw an icon with <code>Draw­Icon</code>
it ended up being drawn at the wrong size.
A call to
<code>Get­Icon­Info</code> confirmed that the icon was
48×48, but it drew at 32×32.
</p>
<p>
The answer is documented in a backwards sort of way
in the <code>Draw­Icon­Ex</code> function, which says at the bottom,
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
To duplicate DrawIcon (hDC, X, Y, hIcon), call <b>DrawIconEx</b> as follows:
</p>
<pre>
DrawIconEx (hDC, X, Y, hIcon, 0, 0, 0, NULL,
            DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT | DI_DEFAULTSIZE);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Aha, if you use <code>Draw­Icon</code>, then the icon size is ignored
and it is drawn with <code>DI_DEFAULT­SIZE</code>.
</p>
<p>
The fix, therefore, was to switch to the <code>Draw­Icon­Ex</code>
function so I could remove the <code>DI_DEFAULT­SIZE</code> flag,
thereby permitting the icon to be drawn at its actual size.
</p>
<pre>
- DrawIcon(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico);
+ DrawIcon<font color="red">Ex</font>(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico, <font color="red">0, 0, 0, NULL, DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT</font>);
</pre>
<p>
A bonus quirk of the
<code>DI_DEFAULT­SIZE</code> flag
(and therefore of the
<code>Draw­Icon</code> function)
is that the drawing is done at the default <i>icon</i> size,
even if you asked it to draw a <i>cursor</i>.</p>
