<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I GetProcAddress a function I dllexport'ed?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccelng/htm/msmod_20.asp"> The dllexport attribute tells the linker to generate an export table entry for the specified function.  This export entry is <b>decorated</b>. This is necessary to support <code>dllexport</code>ing of overloaded functions. But it also means that the string you pass to <code>GetProcAddress</code> needs to be decorated.
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/07/48303.aspx"> As we learned earlier</a>, the decoration scheme varies from architecture to architecture and from calling convention to calling convention. So, for example, if the function is exported from a PPC DLL, you would have to do <code>GetProcAddress(hinst, "..SomeFunction")</code>, but if it is exported from an 80386 DLL as extern “C” __stdcall, you would need <code>GetProcAddress(hinst, "_SomeFunction@8")</code>, but if it’s __fastcall you would need <code>GetProcAddress(hinst, "@SomeFunction@8")</code>.
What’s more, C++ decoration varies from compiler vendor to compiler vendor. A C++ exported function might require <code>GetProcAddress(hinst, "?SomeFunction@@YGXHH@Z")</code> if compiled with the Microsoft C++ compiler, but some other decorated string if compiled with the Borland C++ compiler.
So if you intend people to be able to <code>GetProcAddress</code> for functions and you intend your code to be portable to multiple platforms, or if you intend them  to be able to use your DLL from a language other than C/C++ or use a C++ compiler different from Microsoft Visual Studio, then you must export the function by its undecorated name.
When a DLL is generated, the linker produces a matching LIB file which translates the decorated names to undecorated names. So, for example, the LIB file has an entry that says, “If somebody asks for the function _GetTickCount@0, send them to kernel32!GetTickCount.”
 Exercise: If <code>dllexport</code> ties you to an architecture, compiler, and language (by exporting decorated names), then why does MSVCRT.DLL use it?
