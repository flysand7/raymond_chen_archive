<p>A colleague of mine asked for help debugging a strange failure. Execution halted because the CPU detected that it was trying to execute data. </p>

<p>My colleague suspected that a return address got overwritten by some function deeper in the stack, and that caused the instruction pointer to jump to a random module, and the victim module was ABC. </p>
<p>I looked at the crash dump, and came to a different conclusion. The stack is just fine. The problem is that a DLL got unloaded: </p>
<pre>
0:067&gt; lm
...
Unloaded modules:
...
00007ffc`fd140000 00007ffc`fd1ee000   DEF.dll
...
</pre>
<p>After <code>DEF.dll</code> got unloaded, <code>ABC.DLL</code> got loaded into the same location. </p>
<pre>
0:067&gt; .reload /unl DEF.dll
WARNING: DEF overlaps ABC
</pre>
<p>The problem is that <code>DEF.dll</code> unloaded before destroying all its windows. And then its window received a message (in this case, <code>WM_ACTIVATE­APP</code>, but you were not expected to know this since it wasn’t in the stack trace). The window manager called the window procedure, which now points into the middle of <code>ABC.dll</code>. The debugger is correctly reporting that execution halted in the middle of <code>ABC.dll</code>. </p>
<p>The next step is to engage the people responsible for <code>DEF.dll</code> to figure out why they leaked a window. </p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: What command would be useful at this point to help the <code>DEF.dll</code> identify the window that they leaked? </p>
