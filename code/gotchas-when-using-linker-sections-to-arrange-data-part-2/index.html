<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Gotchas when using linker sections to arrange data, part 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We saw <a href="/code/gotchas-when-using-linker-sections-to-arrange-data-part-1"> last time</a> that you need to accommodate potential padding between fragments within a section when walking through an array of pointers. Fortunately, it’s a simple matter of skipping over null pointer entries.</p>
<p>Dealing with padding between fragments when you have a sequence of structures is more complicated, because the amount of padding may not be an exact multiple of the structure size.</p>
<pre>struct THING
{
    const char* name;
    int value;
};

#pragma section("mydata$a", read)  
__declspec(allocate("mydata$a")) \
    const THING firstThing{};

#pragma section("mydata$m", read)  
#define ADD_THING(x, y) \
__declspec(allocate("mydata$m")) \
    const THING thing##x{#x, y}

#pragma section("mydata$z", read)  
__declspec(allocate("mydata$z")) \
    const THING lastThing{};

// file1.cpp
ADD_THING(Red, 3);

// file2.cpp
ADD_THING(Blue, 4);

// file3.cpp
ADD_THING(Green, 0);
</pre>
<p>We would be tempted to write</p>
<pre>// Code in italics is wrong.
<i>void LessNaiveRegisterAllTheThings()
{
    auto begin = (uintptr_t)&amp;firstThing + sizeof(firstThing);
    auto end = (uintptr_t)&amp;lastThing;
    for (auto current = begin; current &lt; end;
         current += sizeof(THING)) {
      auto thing = (const THING*)current;
      if (thing-&gt;name) RegisterThing(thing-&gt;name, thing-&gt;value);
    }
}</i>
</pre>
<p>However this will run into trouble if padding is inserted that is not a multiple of <code>sizeof(THING)</code>. In that case, advancing by <code>sizeof(THING)</code> would eventually cause us to step over some padding bytes as well as the initial bytes of a valid <code>THING</code>.</p>
<p>We will have to walk the pointer past any null bytes until we find the start of a “good” structure.</p>
<p>This also means that zero cannot be a legitimate value for the first member of a “good” structure, because we wouldn’t be able to figure out whether a zero value is the start of a “good” structure, or whether it’s just padding.</p>
<p>In the above example, we know that the name is never null, so we can use that as our signal as to whether we have the start of a valid <code>THING</code>. If not, then we advance by the alignment of a <code>THING</code> and try again.</p>
<pre>void RegisterAllTheThings()
{
    auto begin = (uintptr_t)&amp;firstThing + sizeof(THING);
    auto end = (uintptr_t)&amp;lastThing;
    auto current = begin;
    while (current &lt; end) {
        auto thing = (const THING*)current;
        if (thing-&gt;name) {
            RegisterThing(thing-&gt;name, thing-&gt;value);
            current += sizeof(THING);
        } else {
            current += alignof(THING);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>A less complicated alternative is to avoid generating structures into ordered segments and just use pointers exclusively.</p>
<pre>#pragma section("mydata$a", read)  
__declspec(allocate("mydata$a")) \
    const THING* const firstThing = nullptr;

#pragma section("mydata$m", read)  
#define ADD_THING(x, y, s) \
    const THING thing##x{#x, y}; \
__declspec(allocate("mydata$m")) \
    const THING* const thing##x##ptr = &amp;thing##x;

#pragma section("mydata$z", read)  
__declspec(allocate("mydata$z")) \
    const THING* const lastThing = nullptr;

// file1.cpp
ADD_THING(Red, 3);

// file2.cpp
ADD_THING(Blue, 4);

// file3.cpp
ADD_THING(Green, 0);
</pre>
<p>At this point, we can use the “pointers” pattern.</p>
<pre>void RegisterAllTheThings()
{
    auto begin = (uintptr_t)&amp;firstThing
                 + sizeof(firstThing);
    auto end = (uintptr_t)&amp;lastThing;
    for (auto current = begin; current &lt; end;
         current += sizeof(const THING*)) {
      auto thing = *(const THING* const*)current;
      if (thing) RegisterThing(thing-&gt;name, thing-&gt;value);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>For extra style points, you could move the <code>firstThing</code> to <code>mydata$b</code> and generate the <code>THING</code> objects into <code>mydata$a</code>. This keeps all the <code>THING</code> objects contiguous in memory, which is more cache-friendly. It also keeps them close to the pointer table, which means that they will all page in/out together. Since this data is probably going to be used only at process startup, putting them all together lets them page out once and stay out.</p>
