<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Producing an empty Windows Runtime type in C++/WinRT</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Windows Runtime types fall into two general categories: Reference types and value types.</p>
<p>Reference types are copied by reference. When you copy a reference type, you’re really just incrementing the reference count on the underlying object. And Windows Runtime references can be null.</p>
<p>Value types are copied by value. When you copy a value type, you are making a shallow copy of everything inside it. Windows Runtime values cannot be null.</p>
<p>There are cases where you want to produce an empty Windows Runtime type. For reference types, this would be a null reference, and for value types, it would be a default-initialized value filled with zero, <code>false</code>, and null, as appropriate.</p>
<p>In other words, we want to replicate what C# <code>default(T)</code> does.</p>
<p>Using <code>{}</code> to generate an empty value works for delegates, interfaces, and value types, but not for runtime classes, because C++/WinRT expresses the default constructor of the runtime class as the default constructor of the projection. In other words, default-constructing a Windows Runtime class in C++/WinRT actually <i>creates an object</i>, so you don’t get <code>nullptr</code> at all. You get a real live object.</p>
<p>We need to detect the case where we have a Windows Runtime runtime class and use the <code>nullptr</code> constructor in that case.</p>
<p>The shortcut here is that the <code>nullptr</code> constructor also works for delegates and interfaces, we can just use it for all reference types.</p>
<p>And that leads us to this:</p>
<pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
constexpr T winrt_empty_value() noexcept
{
    if constexpr (std::is_base_of_v&lt;winrt::Windows::Foundation::IUnknown, T&gt;) {
        return nullptr;
    } else {
        return {};
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Making the whole thing <code>constexpr</code> allows it to be used a lot of places that would normally be constrained to constants.</p>
<p>This function will come in handy later, but we’ll have to get there first.</p>
