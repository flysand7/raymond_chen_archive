<p>What does GDI use <code>BITMAP­INFO­HEADER.biXPels­Per­Meter</code> and <code>Set­Bitmap­Dimension­Ex</code> for?</p>
<p> Nothing. </p>
<p> The <code>BITMAP­INFO­HEADER.biXPels­Per­Meter</code> and <code>BITMAP­INFO­HEADER.biYPels­Per­Meter</code> are completely ignored by GDI when loading a bitmap. The values are there for the benefit of image-editing programs who want to record additional information about the bitmap, but GDI ignores them. </p>
<p> Similarly, the <code>Set­Bitmap­Dimension­Ex</code> and <code>Get­Bitmap­Dimension­Ex</code> functions update a <code>SIZE</code> structure associated with each bitmap, but GDI does nothing with the values, aside from initializing them to zero when the bitmap is created. </p>
<p> The value is there so that, for example, a program which puts a bitmap on the clipboard can specify the recommended physical dimensions of the bitmap, in order to help another program that reads the bitmap from the clipboard (for example, a word processor) decide how big to resize the bitmap when it is pasted. </p>
<p> Whether any programs actually do this sort of thing I do not know. </p>
<p> But that’s what it’s there for, in case anybody wanted to do it. </p>
