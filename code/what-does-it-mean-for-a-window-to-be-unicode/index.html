<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does it mean for a window to be Unicode?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Is­Window­Unicode</code> function reports whether the current window procedure expects Unicode window messages. What specifically does this mean? </p>
<p>It means that messages like <code>WM_</code><code>CHAR</code> will report characters as Unicode code units rather than as ANSI code units. </p>
<p>Okay, so what determines whether a window procedure receives Unicode messages? </p>
<p>When a window is created, its initial window procedure comes from the class registration. If the class was registered with <code>Register­Class[Ex]W</code>, then it is a Unicode window procedure; otherwise it was registered with <code>Register­Class[Ex]A</code> and is an ANSI window procedure. </p>
<p>If a window is subclassed with a function pointer, then the new window procedure is Unicode if it was set with <code>Set­Window­Long­PtrW(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code> and ANSI if it was set with <code>Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>. </p>
<p>As we saw some time ago, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/"><code>Get­Window­Long­Ptr(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code> returns a thunk</a> if you use the ANSI version but the current window procedure is Unicode, or vice versa. Suppose the window procedure is Unicode and you call <code>Get­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>. This will return you a thunk, and if you later set that thunk back as the window procedure with <code>Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>, then the original Unicode window procedure is restored, and the window is a Unicode window again. </p>
<p>Note that calling <code>Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code> can result in a window procedure that is Unicode. </p>
<p>As a window message travels from one window procedure to another window procedure (via <code>Call­Window­Proc</code>), the character set may flip between Unicode and ANSI. The <code>Is­Window­Unicode</code> function tells you only about the window’s current window procedure. </p>
