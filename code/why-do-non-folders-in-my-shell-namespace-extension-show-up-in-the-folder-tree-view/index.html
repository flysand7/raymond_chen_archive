<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do non-folders in my shell namespace extension show up in the folder tree view?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was having trouble with their shell namespace extension:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When we click the [+] button next to our shell namespace extension  in the folder tree view, the tree view shows both files and folders, even though it’s supposed to show only folders. Our <code>IShell­Folder::Get­Attributes­Of</code> does return the correct values for <code>SFGAO_FOLDER</code> (including it for the folders and omitting it for the non-folders). What are we doing wrong? </p></blockquote>
<p> The tree view enumerates the children of a folder by calling <code>IShell­Folder::Enum­Objects</code> and passing the <code>SHCONTF_FOLDERS</code> flag while omitting the <code>SHCONTF_NONFOLDERS</code> flag. This means that it is only interested in enumerating child folders. Child non-folders should be excluded from the enumeration.
 It so happens that the customer’s shell namespace extension was not respecting the <code>SHCONTF_FOLDERS</code> and <code>SHCONTF_NONFOLDERS</code> flags; it always enumerated all objects regardless of what the caller requested.</p>
<p> Fixing the enumerator fixed the problem. </p>
