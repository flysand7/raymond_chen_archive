<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">So how bad is it that I’m calling RegOpenKey instead of RegOpenKeyEx?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had some code that called the <code>Reg­Open­Key</code> function and was concerned by the remark in MSDN: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><b>Note</b>  This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. Applications should use the <b>RegOpenKeyEx</b> function. </p></blockquote>
<p>What are the dire consequences of using this old function instead of the new one? </p>
<p>In general, not much. </p>
<p>If you call <code>Reg­Open­Key</code>, then some compatibility stuff kicks in, and then it goes ahead and behaves as if you had called <code>Reg­Open­Key­Ex</code>. </p>
<p>In the specific case of <code>Reg­Open­Key</code>, the compatibility stuff is mentioned in the parameter documentation of <code>Reg­Open­Key</code>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><i>lpSubKey</i>: If this parameter is <b>NULL</b> or a pointer to an empty string, the function returns the same handle that was passed in. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is different from <code>Reg­Open­Key­Ex</code>, which always returns a new key. It means that if you pass <code>NULL</code> as the <code>lpSub­Key</code>, then the returned registry key is the same as the one that you passed in, and therefore it does <i>not</i> create a new obligation to call <code>Reg­Close­Key</code>. In other words, this code has a potential bug: </p>
<pre>
void DoSomething(HKEY hkey, PCSTR subkeyName)
{
  HKEY subkey;
  if (RegOpenKey(hkey, subkeyName, &amp;subkey) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
    // do something
    RegCloseKey(subkey);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The bug occurs if <code>subkeyName</code> is <code>NULL</code> or <code>""</code>. In that case, the special <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/17/7137438.aspx">16-bit compatibility behavior</a> kicks in, and <code>subkey</code> is set to a copy of <code>hkey</code>. This means that when you do <code>Reg­Close­Key(subkey)</code>, you are <i>closing the original <code>hkey</code></i>, and the caller will probably be rather upset that you closed a key out from under it. </p>
<p>If you know that <code>subkeyName</code> is never <code>NULL</code> or <code>""</code>, then you can safely close the key. Otherwise, you either need to check against this special case or (better) just switch to <code>Reg­Open­Key­Ex</code> so you don’t have to deal with the special case in the first place. </p>
