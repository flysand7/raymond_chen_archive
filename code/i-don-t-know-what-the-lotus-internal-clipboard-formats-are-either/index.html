<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I don't know what the Lotus internal clipboard formats are either</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<blockquote class="q"><p>  I’ve been trying to write an application which allows to drag and drop documents from lotus notes. If I just drag and drop a document from lotus notes to Windows explorer, it creates a .shb file (regular windows document link file). Therefore I think it is possible to simulate this in a custom application as well. </p>
<p> BTW: I found that lotus notes uses following list of clipboard formats for OLE drag drop.<br/> Notes Private Data<br/> Notes Private Link<br/> Link Source Descriptor<br/> Link Source </p>
<p> I also think only the last two formats will be enough for the task I want to accomplish. In fact they are more likely to be windows OLE clipboard formats. However, these clipboard formats are not documented. </p>
<p> I would be grateful if you could send me the definitions of data structures I could use to access data from these CFs.  </p>

<p> (Here’s <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1159241674.655077.210330@b28g2000cwb.googlegroups.com"> another example</a>.)
 I’m not sure why somebody who works for Microsoft is expected to be able to produce documentation on a Lotus Notes data structure.
 When you drag a COM object into an Explorer window on Windows XP, the resulting scrap file doesn’t understand the object you dropped. It just makes a copy of it. When you drag the scrap and drop it back into a document, the scrap merely spits back the data it was cloned from. But it doesn’t know what that data means.
 If you stick a piece of paper in a photocopier, it will produce a copy of the original document. But there’s no point asking the manufacturer of the copier, “I put this document written in French into your copier, and it made a copy. Can you tell me what it says? Obviously, you understand French because you were able to copy the document.”</p>
<p> Reading the question again, perhaps the person is asking for documentation on Link Source Descriptor and Link Source. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/21/2757223.aspx"> Don’t be helpless</a>. I don’t know what they do either, but a little searching turns up <code>OBJECTDESCRIPTOR</code> for the link source descriptor. Link source is a little trickier, but from <a href="http://www.jeffscorner.homeip.net/ftp/Applications/Productivity/Programming/Compilers/Borland/BC45/SOURCE/OCF/BOCOLE/BOLESITE.CPP"> this page</a> it appears to be a serialized moniker. I have never worked with OLE embeddings; I don’t know any more than the next guy. Why don’t you go read about it and write a blog entry summarizing what you’ve learned? </p>
