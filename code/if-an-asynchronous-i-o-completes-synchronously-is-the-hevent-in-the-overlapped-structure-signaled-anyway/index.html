<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If an asynchronous I/O completes synchronously, is the hEvent in the OVERLAPPED structure signaled anyway?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Yes.
 When an I/O completes (whether synchronously or asynchronously), the event is signaled and completion status notifications are queued. The <code>Get­Overlapped­Result/Ex</code> function can be used to wait on an I/O that has already completed; it will merely return immediately. If you ask <code>Has­Overlapped­Io­Completed</code> whether the I/O has completed, and the I/O completed synchronously, it will correctly report, “Yeah, of course it completed. Heck, it completed a long time ago!”</p>
<p> In other words, you can logically treat the case of an asynchronous I/O request completing synchronously as if it had completed asynchronously. It just completes asynchronously <i>before you even blinked</i>. </p>
