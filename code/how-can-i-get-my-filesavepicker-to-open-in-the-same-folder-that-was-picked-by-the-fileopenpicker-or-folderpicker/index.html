<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I get my <code>FileSavePicker</code> to open in the same folder that was picked by the <code>FileOpenPicker</code> or <code>FolderPicker</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Say you want your <code>File­Save­Picker</code> to default to the same folder that was picked by the <code>Folder­Picker</code>. Or your <code>File­Open­Picker</code> to default to the same directory that was used by the <code>FileSavePicker</code>. Or any combination of the above. Basically, you want all the pickers to resume where the previous one left off. How do you do that?</p>
<p>By default, each picker keeps a separate history of recent locations, but you can override this by setting an explicit <code>Settings­Identifier</code> on the picker. We saw this earlier when we <a href="/code/the-settingsidentifier-property-of-the-various-file-pickers-lets-you-give-names-to-your-pickers" title="The SettingsIdentifier property of the various file pickers lets you give names to your pickers"> explored how to keep two different sets of history</a>, so that you could have a most recent location for, say, movie clips, and a different most recent location for background music.</p>
<p>But in addition to keeping settings separate, you can use the <code>Settings­Identifier</code> to make them the same.</p>
<p>If you give your <code>File­Save­Picker</code>, <code>File­Open­Picker</code>, and <code>Folder­Picker</code> the same <code>Settings­Identifier</code>, then they will share the same history of recent locations. Each one will resume in the location that the previous one left off.</p>
<pre>async Task&lt;StorageFile&gt; LoadAsync()
{
  var picker = new FileOpenPicker {
    SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.DocumentsLibrary,
    FileTypeFilter = { ".txt" },
    <span style="color: blue;">SettingsIdentifier = "Common"</span>
  };
  return await picker.PickSingleFileAsync();
}

async Task&lt;StorageFile&gt; SaveAsync()
{
  var picker = new FileSavePicker {
    SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.DocumentsLibrary,
    FileTypeChoices = { ["Plain Text"] = new[] { ".txt" } },
    SuggestedFileName = "New Document",
    <span style="color: blue;">SettingsIdentifier = "Common"</span>
  };
  return await picker.PickSaveFileAsync();
}

async Task&lt;StorageFolder&gt; PickFolderAsync()
{
  var picker = new FolderPicker {
    SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.VideosLibrary,
    FileTypeFilter = { ".txt" },
    <span style="color: blue;">SettingsIdentifier = "Common"</span>
  };
  return await picker.PickSingleFolderAsync();
}
</pre>
<p>You can combine this with the previous trick of keeping different pickers separate: You can have a group of pickers that all share their settings for movie clips, and another group of pickers that share their settings for background music.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The Win32 equivalent of the Windows Runtime <code>SettingsIdentifier</code> is <code>IFileDialog::SetClientGuid</code>. Call <code>IFileDialog::ClearClientData</code> to clean up the saved information.</p>
