<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does this mean? The caller specified wait timed out before the operation completed because a host termination is in queued</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>So your program is running along, minding its own business, and then it crashes with exception <code>0x80070bfe</code> = “The caller specified wait timed out before the operation completed because a host termination is in queued”, or possibly <code>0x80070bfd</code> = “The caller specified wait timed out before the operation completed.” This is completely gibberish. What does it mean? I don’t remember specifying any timeout, and I don’t know what a host termination is.</p>
<p>It means that you called <code>Core­Application.<wbr/>Create­New­View</code> while your app was suspending or resuming.</p>
<p>This particular error is generated deep inside the windowing infrastructure code, and the problem manifests itself in an internal timeout. The inner low-level component reports that an operation timed out, and that’s the reason why the error message talks about a timeout.</p>
<p>This error is then propagated all the way up the chain back to the application without anybody ever realizing, “Hey, this error may not make sense to the person I’m reporting it to.” The error message made sense at the point of origination, but by the time the error reaches the application, the original context of the error is long gone, and the message makes no sense unless you’re wearing windowing infrastructure-colored glasses.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Sometimes the error manifests itself in error <code>0X87B20C08</code>, which doesn’t even have an associated message!</p>
