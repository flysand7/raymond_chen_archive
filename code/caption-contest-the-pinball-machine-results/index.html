<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Caption contest: The pinball machine: Results</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s been quite a while, but a winner in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/25/9505722.aspx"> the caption contest</a> has been selected and the prize finally reached its destination. (Mostly due to procrastination on my part. Don’t blame the postal service.)
 The winner is <a href="http://www.guidedbycharts.com/"> Scott</a> from Australia with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/25/9505722.aspx#9509354"> his entry</a></p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Only 5,000 more referrals until MULTIBALL </p></blockquote>
<p> Even though it’s kind of low-brow, it made me laugh spontaneously.</p>
<p> For his efforts, Scott wins a deluxe prize package consisting of </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/2010/">     Exchange 2010</a> laptop skin </li>
<li>I’m a PC sticker and yoyo </li>
<li>Windows 7 stress ball </li>
<li>Assorted logo pens (Microsoft, Xbox 360, Microsoft Office) </li>
<li>TSA-approved Microsoft travel lock (so he can travel to our country     should he be so inspired) </li>
<li>Miscellaneous historical items from the wayback drawer 
<ul>
<li>Windows Me pen     </li>
<li>Microsoft Bob lapel pin     </li>
<li>Microsoft 20th anniversary kazoo     </li>
<li>Temporary tattoos: Windows 2000, Windows 95,     OLE (who knew they even had a logo!),     Microsoft Visual Tools,     MSN,     Microsoft BackOffice. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Here’s Scott’s acceptance speech: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I’d like to thank all the letters that made the caption possible – the O, the N, the R, and especially the L – that little guy really pulled his weight. And thank you to the 1990’s, for coming up with blogs, so that I could one day win a caption contest. </p></blockquote>
