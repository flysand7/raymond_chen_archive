<p>
Pointers to member functions are very strange animals.</p>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: The discussion that follows is specific to
the way pointers to member functions are implemented by the
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  Other compilers may do things
differently.
</p>
<p>
Well, okay, if you only use single inheritance, then
pointers to member functions are just a pointer to the
start of the function, since all the base classes
share the same “this” pointer:
</p>
<pre>
class Simple { int s; void SimpleMethod(); };
class Simple2 : public Simple
  { int s2; void Simple2Method(); };
class Simple3 : public Simple2
  { int s3; Simple3Method(); };
</pre>
<table border="0">
<col align="center" span="3"/>
<tr>
<td valign="top">p</td>
<td valign="top">→</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px buttonshadow;width: 10em">

<p>    Simple3::s3
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Since they all use the same “this” pointer (p), a pointer to
a member function of Base can be used as if it were a pointer
to a member function of Derived2 without any adjustment
necessary.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
The size of a pointer-to-member-function of a class that
uses only single inheritance is just the size of a pointer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But if you have multiple base classes, then things get interesting.</p>
<pre>
class Base1 { int b1; void Base1Method(); };
class Base2 { int b2; void Base2Method(); };
class Derived : public Base1, Base2
  { int d; void DerivedMethod(); };
</pre>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0">
<col align="center" span="3"/>
<tr>
<td valign="top">p</td>
<td valign="top">→</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px buttonshadow;border-bottom: none;width: 10em">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">q</td>
<td valign="top">→</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px buttonshadow;border-top: none;width: 10em">

<p>       Derived::d
    </p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
There are now two possible “this” pointers.  The first (p) is used
by both Derived and Base1, but the second (q) is used by Base2.
</p>
<p>
A pointer to a member function of Base1 can be used as a pointer
to a member function of Derived, since they both use the same “this”
pointer.  But a pointer to a member function of Base2 cannot be
used as-is as a pointer to a member function of Derived, since the
“this” pointer needs to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways of solving this.
Here’s how the Visual Studio compiler decides to handle it:
</p>
<p>
A pointer to a member function of a multiply-inherited class
is really a structure.
</p>
<table border="0">
<col align="center"/>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 1px buttonshadow;width: 10em">
    Address of function
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 1px buttonshadow;width: 10em">
       Adjustor
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
The size of a pointer-to-member-function of a class that
uses multiple inheritance is the size of a pointer plus the
size of a size_t.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Compare this to the case of a class that uses only single inheritance.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
The size of a pointer-to-member-function can change depending on
the class!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Aside: Sadly, this means that Rich Hickey’s wonderful technique of
<a href="http://www.tutok.sk/fastgl/callback.html">Callbacks
in C++ Using Template Functors</a> cannot be used as-is.
You have to fix the place where he writes the comment</p>

// Note: this code depends on all ptr-to-mem-funcs being same size
</pre>

<p>
Okay, back to our story.
</p>
<p>To call through a pointer to a member function, the “this”
pointer is adjusted by the Adjustor, and then the function
provided is called.  A call through
a function pointer might be compiled like this:
</p>
<pre>
void (Derived::*pfn)();
Derived d;
(d.*pfn)();
  lea  ecx, d       ; ecx = "this"
  add  ecx, pfn[4]  ; add adjustor
  call pfn[0]       ; call
</pre>
<p>
When would an adjustor be nonzero?  Consider the case above.
The function Derived::Base2Method() is really Base2::Base2Method()
and therefore expects to receive “q” as its “this” pointer.
In order to convert a “p” to a “q”, the adjustor must have the
value sizeof(Base1), so that when the first line of Base2::Base2Method()
executes, it receives the expected “q” as its “this” pointer.
</p>
<p>
“But why not just use a thunk instead of manually adding the adjustor?”
In other words, why not just use a simple pointer to a thunk that
goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
Derived::Base2Method thunk:
    add ecx, sizeof(Base1)  ; convert "p" to "q"
    jmp Base2::Base2Method  ; continue
</pre>
<p>
and use that thunk as the function pointer?
</p>
<p>
The reason: Function pointer casts.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following code:</p>
<pre>
void (Base2::*pfnBase2)();
void (Derived::*pfnDerived)();
pfnDerived = pfnBase2;
  mov  ecx, pfnBase2            ; ecx = address
  mov  pfnDerived[0], ecx
  mov  pfnDerived[4], sizeof(Base1) ; adjustor!
</pre>
<p>
We start with a pointer to a member function of Base2,
which is a class that uses only single inheritance, so it
consists of just a pointer to the code.
To assign it to a pointer to a member function
of Derived, which uses multiple inheritance, we can re-use
the function address, but we now need an adjustor so that
the pointer “p” can properly be converted to a “q”.
</p>
<p>
Notice that the code doesn’t know what function pfnBase2
points to, so it can’t just replace it with the matching thunk.
It would have to generate a thunk at runtime and somehow
use its psychic powers to decide when the memory can safely
be freed.  (This is C++.  No garbage collector here.)
</p>
<p>
Notice also that when pfnBase2
got cast to a pointer to member function of Derived, its size changed,
since it went from a pointer to a function in a class that uses only single
inheritance to a pointer to a function in a class
that uses multiple inheritance.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
Casting a function pointer can change its size!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I bet that you didn’t know that before reading this entry.
</p>
<p>
There’s still an awful lot more to this topic,
but I’m going to stop here before everybody’s head explodes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Consider the class</p>
<pre>
class Base3 { int b3; void Base3Method(); };
class Derived2 : public Base3, public Derived { };
</pre>
<p>How would the following code be compiled?</p>
<pre>
void (Derived::*pfnDerived)();
void (Derived2::*pfnDerived2();
pfnDerived2 = pfnDerived;
</pre>
