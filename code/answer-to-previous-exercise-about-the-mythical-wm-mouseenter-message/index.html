<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Answer to previous exercise about the mythical WM_MOUSEENTER message</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/9182ea55-ceb8-44d0-bde3-97bd6b278b47">If the program starts with the mouse already in the client area without moving, why do you get a beep?</a></p>
<p>Because of the <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/d8afd9b1-06ec-4046-939d-ddc4d7662ec2">spurious WM_MOUSEMOVE</a> message that is generated when a window is created. In this case, the spurious message is a good thing, since it lets us do our mouse work at window creation.</p>
