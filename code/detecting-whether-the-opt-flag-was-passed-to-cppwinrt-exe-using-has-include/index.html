<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Detecting whether the <code>-opt</code> flag was passed to <code>cppwinrt.exe</code>: Using <code>__has_include</code></h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was upgrading the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples"> Window UWP Samples repo</a> to take advantage of the new <code>-opt</code> flag introduced in C++/WinRT 2.0. This provides performance improvements for accessing static class members, and avoids having to register the type in your manifest for strictly in-module consumption.</p>
<p>The new <code>-opt</code> flag enables these optimizations, but it also adds a new requirement: Your implementation file needs to <code>#include &lt;ClassName.g.cpp&gt;</code>. The problem is that I wanted to upgrade the samples one at a time, but that meant that the shared files needed to support both optimized and unoptimized builds, at least until I get them all converted.</p>
<p>I was at a bit of a loss, because there was no obvious <code>#define</code> in <code>winrt/base.h</code> that tells me whether the <code>-opt</code> flag was passed.</p>
<p>And then I realized: I could use <code>__has_include</code>.</p>
<p>C++17 introduced the <code>__has_include</code> preprocessor keyword which snoops around to determine whether a header file exists. The idea is that you could conditionalize based on whether an optional header file is present. For example, you might check for the presence of <code>xmmintrin.h</code> and conditionally enable SSE operations.</p>
<p>In my case, I wouldn’t be probing for a system header file, but rather for a generated <code>.g.cpp</code> file produce by <code>cppwinrt.exe</code> in <code>-opt</code> mode.</p>
<pre>#if __has_include(&lt;MainPage.g.cpp&gt;)
#include &lt;MainPage.g.cpp&gt;
#endif
</pre>
<p>If <code>cppwinrt.exe</code> were run with the <code>-opt</code> flag, then the <code>MainPage.g.cpp</code> file will exist in the <code>Generated Files</code> directory, and I can include it. If it were run without the <code>-opt</code> flag, then the <code>MainPage.g.cpp</code> file will not exist, and I skip over it.</p>
