<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Are SetProp and RemoveProp thread-safe?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know whether the <code>Set­Prop</code> and <code>Remove­Prop</code> functions are thread-safe with respect to a specific window and property. “It seems to work under the debugger, but that doesn’t prove that it always will work.” </p>
<p>It depends on what you mean by “thread-safe”. If you have two threads which call <code>Set­Prop</code> or <code>Remove­Prop</code> without synchronization between them, then each individual call will be atomic. For example, two non-synchronized calls to <code>Set­Prop</code> will result in the final property being one value or the other, not a mix of the two values. </p>
<p>On the other hand, you cannot predict what order the operations were ultimately performed. All that is guaranteed is that the result will be consistent with <i>some</i> ordering of the operations. </p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a window and a property whose initial value is 1. One thread calls <code>Set­Prop(hwnd, 2)</code> and the other calls <code>Remove­Prop(hwnd)</code>. There are two possible outcomes: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th colspan="2" valign="baseline">Outcome 1</th>
<th colspan="2" valign="baseline">Outcome 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property value is 1</td>
<td></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property value is 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code>SetProp(hwnd, 2);</code></td>
<td valign="baseline">Changes property to 2</td>
<td valign="baseline"><code>RemoveProp(hwnd);</code></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property is removed<br/>        Returns 1 (removed value)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code>RemoveProp(hwnd);</code></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property is removed<br/>        Returns 2 (removed value)</td>
<td valign="baseline"><code>SetProp(hwnd, 2);</code></td>
<td valign="baseline">Changes property to 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property is removed</td>
<td></td>
<td valign="baseline">Property value is 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The customer seemed satisfied with this answer. </p>
<p>Note that only the individual call to <code>Set­Prop</code> or <code>Remove­Prop</code> is atomic. If you make multiple calls in succession, you cannot guarantee that another thread won’t sneak in between your calls and mess with the property. </p>
<p>Next time, a follow-up question that was never asked. </p>
