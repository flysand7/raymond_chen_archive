<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I suppress full window drag/resize for just one window?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer asked,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Is there a way to turn off Full Window Drag on a single window? I have a resizable control that I would like not update itself while resizing. </p></blockquote>
<p> It so happens that I wrote a sample program ages ago to illustrate how to do this. You can find it in the Platform SDK under <code>winui\fulldrag</code>. The source code is also reproduced in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/121541"> this Knowledge Base article</a>.</p>
<p> In addition to deferring painting, you may also want to defer layout if layout is expensive for your window. </p>
