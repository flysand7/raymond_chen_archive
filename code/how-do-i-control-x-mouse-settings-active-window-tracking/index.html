<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I control X-Mouse settings (active window tracking)?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> For quite some time, Windows has had a setting officially called <i>active window tracking</i> but which informally goes by the name X-Mouse, because that was the name of the PowerToy which first exposed the feature. (The PowerToy was in turn so-named because it made the mouse behave in a manner similar to many X window managers.) The setting is exposed to end users in Windows 7 on <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-the-mouse-easier-to-use"> <i>Make the mouse easier to use</i></a> under <i>Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse</i>. </p>
<p> If you want to write your own PowerToy to control this setting, you can do so by calling the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function. There are three settings which collectively control the X-Mouse feature: </p>
<ol>
<li><code>SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING</code>:     This is the master switch which enables the behavior. </li>
<li><code>SPI_SETACTIVEWNDTRKZORDER</code>:      This controls whether the window is brought to the top     when it is activated by active window tracking. </li>
<li><code>SPI_SETACTIVEWNDTRKTIMEOUT</code>:     This controls how long the mouse has to be in a window     before it is auto-activated. </li>
</ol>
<p> Note that X-Mouse is a user preference. Applications should not change the setting without the user’s permission. </p>
