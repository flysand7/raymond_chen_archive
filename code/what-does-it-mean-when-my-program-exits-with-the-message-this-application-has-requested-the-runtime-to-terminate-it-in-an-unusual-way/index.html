<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does it mean when my program exits with the message "This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You’re running your program, and then it suddenly exits with the message <i>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way</i>. What happened?
 That message is printed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k089yyh0.aspx"> by the C runtime function <code>abort</code></a>, the same function that also causes your program to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/19/10166093.aspx"> terminate with exit code 3</a>.</p>
<p> Your program might call <code>abort</code> explicitly, or it might end up being called implicitly by the runtime library itself. </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9sb57dw4.aspx">     The <code>assert</code> macro calls <code>abort</code></a>     when an assertion fails. </li>
<li>     By default,     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k0k9c522.aspx">     the <code>terminate</code> function</a>     calls <code>abort</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> The C++ standard spells out the conditions under which <code>terminate</code> is called, and it’s quite a long list, so I won’t bother repeating them here. Consult your favorite copy of the C++ standard for details. (The most common reason is throwing an unhandled exception.) </p>
