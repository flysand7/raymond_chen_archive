<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't my program receive the WM_DWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL message when I ask for an iconic representation?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer was having trouble adding Windows 7 taskbar
integration features to their application:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I’m trying to use the new Windows 7 taskbar integration features,
but am running into a problem.
I’ve made certain that my program has the
<code>DWMWA_FORCE_ICONIC_REPRESENTATION</code>
and
<strike><code>DWMWA_HAS_ICONIC_BUTMAP</code></strike>
<code>DWMWA_HAS_ICONIC_BITMAP</code> [corrected 8am]
attributes set,
yet I never receive a <code>WM_DWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL</code>
message in my window procedure.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A member of the taskbar team invoked psychic powers:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
Is your program running elevated by any chance?
If so, then you need to add the
<code>WM_DWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL</code> message
to your UIPI message filter:
</p>
<pre>
ChangeWindowMessageFilter(WM_DWMSENDICONICTHUMBNAIL, MSGFLT_ADD);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Psychic powers once again save the day.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
That was it. Thanks!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that forcing someone to invoke psychic powers is a <i>bad thing</i>.
It means that you withheld crucial information that somebody had to
guess at.
Here are some crucial pieces of information people tend to forget to
mention:
</p>
<ul>
<li>“Oh, did I mention that my process is running elevated?”
<li>“Oh, did I mention that my process is a service?”
<li>“Oh, did I mention that my process is 32-bit, running on a 64-bit machine?”
<li>“Oh, did I mention that I initialized COM as MTA?”
<li>“Oh, did I mention that my process is impersonating another user?”
<li>“Oh, did I mention that I’m running a version of the operating
    system different from Windows 7?” (or whatever the most
    current client operating system is)
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
<b>Added</b>:
The reason those items above are crucial pieces of information is that
all of them (except the last one) are “game-changers”:
If you do any of the things in the list,
a whole bunch of rules change.
It’s like asking a question about traffic regulations and neglecting
to mention that the other vehicle
is a fire truck with its siren on.
(And presumably when you chose to invoke any of those game-changing
conditions, you were aware of the rules which applied to the new situation.
Those rules are documented with the game-changing condition,
not with the general description of a normally-functioning universe.
Imagine if every physics book had the sentence “This rule does not apply
to Superman” at the end of every paragraph.)</p>
