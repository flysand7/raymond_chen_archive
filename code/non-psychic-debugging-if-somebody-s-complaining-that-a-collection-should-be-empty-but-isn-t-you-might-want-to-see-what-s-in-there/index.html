<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Non-psychic debugging: If somebody's complaining that a collection should be empty but isn't, you might want to see what's in there</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A programmer on the GHI team
(yes,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/01/24/10492287.aspx">
the same GHI team</a>)
reported that they were hitting an assertion failure
using an internal library and asked for help debugging it.
</p>
<pre>
// All factories should be unregistered by now
assert(m_pFactoryList-&gt;IsEmpty());
</pre>
<p>
“Can somebody help me figure out which factory it is that
did not get unregistered?”
</p>
<p>
I didn’t work on this internal library, but on the other hand
I’m not afraid to look inside.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see what a <code>m_pFactory­List</code> looks like.
</p>
<pre>
0:000&gt; ?? this-&gt;m_pFactoryList
class LookupTable&lt;CFactory*&gt;
   +0x000 <span style="background-color: yellow">m_uListSize      : 1</span> <font color="blue">// this probably means that the list has one element</font>
   +0x004 <span style="background-color: yellow">m_pList          : 0x00212e60</span> LookupTable&lt;CFactory*&gt;::ENTRY <font color="blue">// this is probably the list</font>
   +0x008 m_uCapacity      : 0x7f
0:000&gt; ?? this-&gt;m_pFactoryList-&gt;m_pList
struct LookupTable&lt;CFactory*&gt;::ENTRY * 0x00212e60
   +0x000 <span style="background-color: yellow">pszName          : 0x02cf4048</span>  "GHI_factory"
   +0x004 <span style="background-color: yellow">data             : 0x02cf4ce0</span> CFactory* <font color="blue">// I bet this is the item that got leaked</font>
0:000&gt; dps 0x02cf4ce0 l1
02cf4ce0  6b626d58 GHI!CGhiFactory::`vftable`
</pre>
<p>
No psychic powers needed here.
I just followed my nose.
</p>
<p>
The assertion says that a list is not empty.
Therefore, we should look to see what is on the list.
</p>
<p>
As a general rule, code is not intentionally written to be
impossible to understand.
The person who wrote it meant well,
so if you see a member called
<code>m_uList­Size</code>, it’s a pretty safe bet that it
represents the list size.
And if you see a member called
<code>m_pList</code>,
it probably points to the start of the list.</p>
