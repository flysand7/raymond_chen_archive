<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The default number of threads in an I/O completion port is the number of processors, but is that logical or physical processors?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/createiocompletionport"><code>Create­Io­Completion­Port</code></a> function lets you specify how many concurrent threads can be processing work from the completion port. But if you pass a value of 0 for <code>Number­Of­Concurrent­Threads</code>, “the system allows as many concurrently running threads as there are processors in the system.” </p>
<p>Are these physical processors or logical processors? </p>
<p>They are logical processors. </p>
<p>One way to figure this out is that the goal of the I/O completion port is to keep CPU usage at exactly 100%. If the I/O completion port consumed only as many threads as physical processors, then you wouldn’t quite get to 100% CPU utilization, because there would be extra capacity on the unused logical processors. </p>
<p>Another way to figure this out is to use your understanding of history. I/O completion ports were created long before hyperthreading was invented, so this code <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">treated all logical processors as full-fledged processors</a>. </p>
<p>And a third way to figure it out is to test it. </p>

<p>Pick a value for <code>THREADS</code> that is greater than the number of logical processors. </p>
<p>We start by creating an I/O completion port and a bunch of threads whose job it is to complete work posted to the port. we then post a lot of work to the port and wait for the threads to drain the work. </p>
<p>Each thread grabs a work item, then increments a counter that lets us know how many threads are actively processing work. The thread then goes into a tight spin loop for one second. It has to do this rather than <code>Sleep</code> because the thread needs to be actively doing work for it to be counted against the I/O completion port’s concurrency limit. </p>
<p>After wasting some time, the thread decrements the count of active threads, and then goes back to looking for more work. </p>
<p>Along the way, we print the number of active threads. </p>
<p>Run this program, and you’ll see that it retires work in chunks, and the number of threads in each chunk is the number of logical processors. </p>
<p>So there, confirmed by experimentation. </p>
