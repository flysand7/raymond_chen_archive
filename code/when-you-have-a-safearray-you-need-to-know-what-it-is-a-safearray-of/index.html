<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When you have a SAFEARRAY, you need to know what it is a SAFEARRAY *of*</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
A customer had a problem with <code>SAFEARRAY</code>,
or more specifically, with
<code>CComSafeArray</code>.
</p>
<pre>
CComSafeArray&lt;VARIANT&gt; sa;
GetAwesomeArray(&amp;sa);</pre></p>
<p>LONG lb = sa.GetLowerBound();
LONG ub = sa.GetUpperBound();</p>
<p>for (LONG i = lb; i &lt;= ub; i++) {
 CComVariant item = sa.GetAt(i);
 … use the item …
}

<p>
The <code>GetAt</code> method returns a
<code>VARIANT&amp;</code>,
and when it is copy-constructed into
<code>item</code>,
the
<code><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/28/9887637.aspx">DISP_E_</a>BAD­VAR­TYPE</code>
exception is raised.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the offending line is changed to
</p>
<pre>
CComQIPtr&lt;IAwesome&gt; pAwesome = sa.GetAt(i).punkVal;
</pre>
<p>
then the problem goes away.
</p>
<p>
Your initial reaction to this code would be that
there is an off-by-one error in the loop control,
but it turns out that there isn’t because
<code>SAFEARRAY</code> uses inclusive upper bounds
rather than exclusive.
</p>
<p>
The first step in debugging this is seeing what is
in the bad variant that makes the copy constructor
think it’s not a valid variant type.
</p>
<p>
Inspecting in the debugger shows that the variant
returned by <code>GetAt</code> has a valid
<code>punk</code>, but the <code>vt</code> is <code>0x1234</code>.
Well, that’s not a valid variant type, so that’s the proximate
cause of the problem.
</p>
<p>
How did an invalid variant type get into your <code>SAFEARRAY</code>?
</p>
<p>
At this point the customer realized that maybe their code to create
the array was faulty,
so they offered to share it.
</p>
<pre>
void GetAwesomeArray(SAFEARRAY **ppsa)
{
 SAFEARRAY *psa = SafeArrayCreateVector(VT_UNKNOWN, 0, m_count);
 for (LONG i = 0; i &lt; m_count; i++) {
  CComPtr&lt;IAwesome&gt; spAwesome;
  CreateAwesomeThing(i, &amp;spAwesome);
  SafeArrayPutElement(psa, &amp;i, spAwesome);
 }
 *ppsa = psa;
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, now all the pieces fell into place.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Get­Awesome­Array</code>
function is creating an array of <code>VT_UNKNOWN</code>,
but the code fragment that calls
<code>Get­Awesome­Array</code>
treats it as an array of <code>VT_VARIANT</code>.
</p>
<p>
Your array of <code>IUnknown*</code> is being misinterpreted
as an array of <code>VARIANT</code>.
That explains all the symptoms:
The <code>vt</code> is wrong, because it’s really just the
low-order word of the first <code>IUnknown*</code>.
Ignoring the <code>vt</code> and going straight for the
<code>punk</code> seems to work because that’s where
the <i>second</i> <code>IUnknown*</code> happens to be.
(Or third, if you are compiling as 32-bit.)
</p>
<p>
In other words, it’s as if you did a
<code>reinterpret_cast&lt;VARIANT&amp;&gt;(punkArray[0])</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you had used regular C-style arrays
or a C++ collection,
then the compile-time type checking would have told you that
you mismatched the producer and consumer.
But since you went through a <code>SAFEARRAY</code>,
that compile-time type information is lost,
since a
<code>SAFEARRAY</code> is a polymorphic array.
It now becomes your job to keep track of what you have an array <i>of</i>,
and its dimensions and bounds.
</p>
<p>
You can keep track of this information via documentation,
“This function returns a 1-dimensional
<code>SAFEARRAY</code> of <code>VT_IUNKNOWN</code>,
with lower bound 0 and variable upper bound.”
Or you can check at runtime, by calling
<code>Safe­Array­Get­Vartype</code>
to see what the base type is,
and
<code>Safe­Get­Dim</code> to see how many
dimensions the array has,
and
<code>Safe­Array­Get­LBound</code>
and
<code>Safe­Array­Get­UBound</code>
to obtain the upper and lower bounds for those dimensions.
</p>
<p>
The code above seemed not to be sure which model it wanted
to use.
It trusted the base type and the dimension,
but checked the upper and lower bounds.
</p>
<p>
Anyway,
assuming we are going with the “keep track via documentation”
approach,
the solution for the original problem is to have
the producer and consumer agree on exactly what kind of
<code>SAFEARRAY</code> is being handed around.
Either produce an array of <code>VT_UNKNOWN</code> and
consume it as a <code>CComSafeArray&lt;IUnknown*&gt;</code>
or produce an array of <code>VT_VARIANT</code> and consume
it as a
<code>CComSafeArray&lt;VARIANT&gt;</code>.
