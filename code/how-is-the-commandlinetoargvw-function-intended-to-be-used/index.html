<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How is the CommandLineToArgvW function intended to be used?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The <code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> function does some basic
command line parsing.
A customer reported that it was producing strange results when
you passed an empty string as the first parameter:
</p>
<pre>
LPWSTR argv = CommandLineToArgvW(L"", &amp;argc);
</pre>
<p>
Well, okay, yeah, but huh?
</p>
<p>
The first parameter to <code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> is supposed
to be the value returned by <code>GetCommandLineW</code>.
That’s the command line, and that’s what
<code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> was designed to parse.
If you pass something else, then
<code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> will try to cope,
but it’s not really doing what it was designed for.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the customer was mistakenly passing the
<code>lpCmdLine</code> parameter that was passed to the
<code>wWinMain</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
int WINAPI wWinMain(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    HINSTANCE <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/15/156022.aspx">hPrevInstance</a>,
    LPWSTR lpCmdLine,
    int nCmdShow)
{
    int argc;
    <i>LPWSTR argv = CommandLineToArgvW(lpCmdLine, &amp;argc);</i>
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
That command line is not in the format that <code>CommandLineToArgvW</code>
expects.
The
<code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> function wants the full, unexpurgated
command line as returned by the <code>GetCommandLineW</code> function,
and it breaks it up on the assumption that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/15/597984.aspx">
the first word on the command line is the program name</a>.
If you hand it an empty string,
the <code>CommandLineToArgvW</code> function says,
“Whoa,
whoever generated this command line totally screwed up.
I’ll try to muddle through as best I can.”
</p>
<p>
Next time, we’ll look at the strange status of quotation marks
and backslashes
in <code>CommandLineToArgvW</code>.</p>
