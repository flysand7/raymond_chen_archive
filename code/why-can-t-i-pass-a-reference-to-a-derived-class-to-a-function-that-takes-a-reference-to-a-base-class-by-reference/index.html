<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I pass a reference to a derived class to a function that takes a reference to a base class by reference?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
“Why can’t I pass a reference to a derived class
to a function that takes a reference to a base class by reference?”
That’s a confusing question, but it’s phrased that way because
the simpler phrasing is wrong!
</p>
<p>
Ths misleading simplified phrasing of the question is
“Why can’t I pass a reference to a derived class to a function that
takes a base class by reference?”
And in fact the answer is “You can!”
</p>
<pre>
class Base { }
class Derived : Base { }
class Program {
  static void f(Base b) { }
  public static void Main()
  {
      Derived d = new Derived();
      f(d);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Our call to <code>f</code> passes a reference to the
derived class
to a function that takes a reference to the base class.
This is perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>
When people ask this question, they are typically wondering
about passing a reference to the base class <i>by reference</i>.
There is a double indirection here.
You are passing a reference to a variable,
and the variable is a reference to the base class.
And it is this double reference that causes the problem.
</p>
<pre>
class Base { }
class Derived : Base { }
class Program {
  static void f(<font color="blue">ref</font> Base b) { }
  public static void Main()
  {
      Derived d = new Derived();
      f(<font color="blue">ref</font> d); <font color="blue">// error</font>
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Adding the <code>ref</code> keyword to the parameter results
in a compiler error:
</p>
<pre>
error CS1503: Argument '1': cannot convert from 'ref Derived' to 'ref Base'
</pre>
<p>
The reason this is disallowed is that it would allow you to violate
the type system.
Consider:
</p>
<pre>
  static void f(ref Base b) { b = new Base(); }
</pre>
<p>
Now things get interesting.
Your call to <code>f(ref d)</code> passes a reference to a
<code>Derived</code> by reference.
When the <code>f</code> function modifies its formal parameter <code>b</code>,
it’s actually modifying your variable <code>d</code>.
What’s worse, it’s putting a <code>Base</code> in it!
When <code>f</code> returns, your variable <code>d</code>,
which is declared as being a reference to a <code>Derived</code>
is actually a reference to the base class <code>Base</code>.
</p>
<p>
At this point everything falls apart.
Your program calls some method like <code>d.OnlyInDerived()</code>,
and the CLR ends up executing a method on an object that doesn’t
even support that method.
</p>
<p>
You actually knew this; you just didn’t know it.
Let’s start from the easier cases and work up.
First, passing a reference into a function:
</p>
<pre>
void f(SomeClass s);
...
   T t = new T();
   f(t);
</pre>
<p>
The function <code>f</code> expects to receive a reference to a
<code>SomeClass</code>, but you’re passing a reference to a <code>T</code>.
When is this legal?
</p>
<p>
“Duh.
<code>T</code> must be <code>SomeClass</code> or a class derived
from <code>SomeClass</code>.”
</p>
<p>
What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.
When you pass a parameter as <code>ref</code>,
it not only goes into the method, but it also comes out.
(<a href="http://foldoc.org/?call-by-value-result">Not strictly true</a>
but close enough.)
You can think of it as a bidirectional parameter to the function call.
Therefore, the rule “If a function expects a reference to a class,
you must provide a reference to that class or a derived class”
applies in both directions.
When the parameter goes in, you must provide a reference to that
class or a derived class.
And when the parameter comes out,
it also must be a reference to that class or a derived class
(because the function is “passing the parameter” back to you, the caller).
</p>
<p>
But the only time that <code>S</code> can be <code>T</code> or a subclass,
while simultaneously having
<code>T</code> be <code>S</code> or a subclass
is when <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> are the same thing.
This is just the law of antisymmetry for partially-ordered sets:
“if <i>a</i> ≤ <i>b</i>
and <i>b</i> ≤ <i>a</i>,
then <i>a</i>&amp;nbsp= <i>b</i>.”</p>
