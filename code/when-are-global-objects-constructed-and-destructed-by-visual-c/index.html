<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When are global objects constructed and destructed by Visual C++?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today we’re going to fill in the following chart:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>When does it run?</td>
<th>Constructor</th>
<th>Destructor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in EXE</th>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in DLL</th>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The C++ language specification provides some leeway to
implementations on when global static objects are constructed.
It can construct the object before <code>main</code> begins,
or it construct the object on demand according to complicated rules.
You can read [basic.start.init] for the gory details.
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume for the sake of discussion that global static
objects are constructed before <code>main</code> begins.
</p>
<p>
For global objects in the EXE, constructing them is no big deal
because the C runtime startup code linked into the EXE does
a bunch of preparation before calling the formal entry point,
be it <code>main</code> or
<code>wWin­Main</code> or whatever.
And part of that preparation is calling constructors for
global objects.
Since the C runtime startup code is in charge,
it can construct the objects right there.
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>When does it run?</td>
<th>Constructor</th>
<th>Destructor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in EXE</th>
<td style="color: blue">C runtime startup code</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in DLL</th>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
DLLs are similar:
The formal <code>Dll­Main</code> entry point is not
the actual entry point to the DLL.
Instead, the entry point is a function provided by the C runtime,
and that function does work before and after calling the
<code>Dll­Main</code> function provided by the application.
We saw this earlier when we discussed
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/08/8841951.aspx">
what happens if you return <code>FALSE</code>
from
<code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
Part of this extra work done by the C runtime library is to
construct DLL globals in <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>
and to destruct them in
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>.
In other words, the code conceptually goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL CALLBACK RealDllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD dwReason, void *pvReserved)
{
  ...
  case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
   Initialize_C_Runtime_Library();
   Construct_DLL_Global_Objects();
   DllMain(hinst, dwReason, pvReserved);
   ...
 case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
   DllMain(hinst, dwReason, pvReserved);
   Destruct_DLL_Global_Objects();
   Uninitialize_C_Runtime_Library();
   break;
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the actual code is more complicated than this,
but that’s the basic idea.
We can fill in two more cells in our table.
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>When does it run?</td>
<th>Constructor</th>
<th>Destructor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in EXE</th>
<td>C runtime startup code</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in DLL</th>
<td style="color: blue">C runtime <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>
    prior to <code>Dll­Main</code></td>
<td style="color: blue">C runtime <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>
    after <code>Dll­Main</code> returns</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The last entry in our table is the tricky one:
Who triggers the destruction of global objects in the EXE destructed?
The C runtime startup code in the EXE is guaranteed to run at process
startup, but how does the C runtime cleanup code run?
</p>
<p>
The answer is that the C runtime library
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/10/16/10565024.aspx">
hires a lackey</a>.
The hired lackey is the C runtime library DLL
(for example,
<code>MSVCR80.DLL</code>).
The C runtime startup code in the EXE
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tze57ck3">
registers all the destructors with the C runtime library DLL</a>,
and when the C runtime library DLL gets its
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>,
it calls all the destructors requested by the EXE.
</p>
<p>
That’s the final cell in our table.
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>When does it run?</td>
<th>Constructor</th>
<th>Destructor</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in EXE</th>
<td>C runtime startup code</td>
<td style="color: blue">C runtime DLL hired lackey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Global object in DLL</th>
<td>C runtime <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>
    prior to <code>Dll­Main</code></td>
<td>C runtime <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>
    after <code>Dll­Main</code> returns</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
You can now answer this customer question and explain the
observed behavior:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
Is it okay to call <code>Load­Library</code>
from within constructors of global C++ objects inside a DLL?
Currently we am seeing weird behavior when doing so.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The customer went on to describe what they were observing.
Their DLL has global C++ objects which do the following
operations in their constructor:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Check a setting.
<li>If the setting is enabled, call
    <code>Load­Library</code> to load a helper DLL,
    then call a function in the helper DLL,
    The result of that function call alters the global behavior
    of the original DLL.
<li>The function in the helper DLL
    creates a thread
    then waits for the thread to produce a result.
<li>The helper thread never gets started.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Result: Process hangs.</p>
