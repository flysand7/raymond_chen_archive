<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does IsPathRelative return FALSE for paths that are drive-relative?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>MSDN distinguishes between <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx#fully_qualified_vs._relative_paths">fully-qualified and relative paths</a>. According to that discussion: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>A file name is relative to the current directory if it does not begin with one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>A UNC name,</li>
<li>A disk designator with a backslash,</li>
<li>A single backslash, for example,     “\directory” or “\file.txt”.     This is also referred to as an <i>absolute path</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a file name begins with only a disk designator but not the backslash after the colon, it is interpreted as a relative path to the current directory on the drive with the specified letter. </p>
<p>A path is also said to be relative if it contains “double-dots”; that is, two periods together in one component of the path. </p>
<p>Relative paths can combine both example types, for example “C:..\tmp.txt”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what exactly is the definition of a relative path? </p>
<p>It’s sort of like art. You know it when you see it. </p>
<p>There are some things that are clearly absolute paths. These are known as fully-qualified paths. They specify both a volume designator and a path relative to the root of that volume. </p>
<p>There are also some things that are clearly relative paths, like <code>dir\file.txt</code>. </p>
<p>And then there are these weird intermediate cases that everybody understands but nobody really knows how to classify like <code>C:..\dir\file.txt</code>. </p>
<p>Here’s a table of possibilities. </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Example</th>

<tr>

<p>The first two rows and the last row are not controversial. The third and fourth rows, on the other hand, are problematic. They live in this shadowy world, half-absolute and half-relative. </p>
