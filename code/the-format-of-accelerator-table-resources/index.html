<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The format of accelerator table resources</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Continuing in the extremely sporadic series on the format of
resources, today we’ll take a look at accelerator tables.
This topic is so simple, I’ll cover both 16-bit and 32-bit
resources on the same day!
</p>
<p>
In 16-bit Windows, the format of an accelerator table resource
was simply an array of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratorstructures/accel.asp">
<code>ACCEL</code> structures</a>.
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct tagACCEL {
    BYTE fVirt;
    BYTE bPadding; /* making the padding explicit */
    WORD key;
    WORD cmd;
} ACCEL, *LPACCEL;
</pre>
<p>
This array is the same array you would pass to the
<code>CreateAcceleratorTable</code>, with one important difference:
The <code>fVirt</code> of the last entry in the accelerator resource
has its high bit set to indicate that it is the end of the table.
</p>
<p>
The format of 32-bit accelerator table resources is nearly identical
to its 16-bit counterpart.
The only difference is the addition of an additional word of padding
to bring the size of the structure up to a multiple of four bytes.
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct tagACCEL_RESOURCE {
    BYTE fVirt;
    BYTE bPadding; /* making the padding explicit */
    WORD key;
    WORD cmd;
    WORD wPadding; /* making the padding explicit */
} ACCEL_RESOURCE;
</pre>
<p>
Once again, the last entry is marked by setting the high bit
of the <code>fVirt</code> member.
The extra word of padding adds a second obstacle to taking the resource
data and passing it to the <code>CreateAcceleratorTable</code>
function to create the accelerator table manually.
Not only do you have to strip off the high bit of the <code>fVirt</code>,
you also have to convert the table to an array of <code>ACCEL</code>
structures
and pass the converted table to the
<code>CreateAcceleratorTable</code> function.
</p>
<p>
That’s all there is to the format of accelerator table resources.
I told you it was pretty simple.</p>
