<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don't trust the return address</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sometimes people ask, “So I know how to get my return address
[use
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/64ez38eh(v=vs.100).aspx">
the _ReturnAddress() intrinsic</a>];
how do I figure out what DLL that return address belongs to?”</p>
<p>
Beware.
</p>
<p>
Even if you figure out which DLL the return address belongs to
[use
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683200(v=vs.100).aspx">
Get­Module­Handle­Ex(GET_MODULE_HANDLE_EX_FLAG_FROM_ADDRESS)</a>],
that doesn’t mean that that is actually the DLL that called you.
</p>
<p>
A common trick is to search through a “trusted” DLL for some code
bytes that coincidentally match ones you (the attacker) want to execute.
This can be something as simple as a “retd” instruction, which
are quite abundant. The attacker then builds a stack frame that
looks like this, for, say, a function that takes two parameters.
</p>
<pre>
trusted_retd
hacked parameter 1
hacked parameter 2
hacker_code_addr
</pre>
<p>
After building this stack frame, the attacker then jumps to
the start of the function being attacked.
</p>
<p>
The function being attacked looks
at the return address and sees <code>trusted_retd</code>,
which resides in a trusted DLL.  It then foolishly trusts the
caller and allows some unsafe operation to occur, using
hacked parameters 1 and 2. The function being attacked then
does a “retd 8” to return and clean the parameters.
This transfers control to the <code>trusted_retd</code>,
which performs a simple <code>retd</code>, which now gives
control to the <code>hacker_code_addr</code>, and the hacker
can use the result to continue his nefarious work.
</p>
<p>
This is why you should be concerned if somebody says,
“This code verifies that its caller is trusted…”
How do they know who the caller really is?</p>
