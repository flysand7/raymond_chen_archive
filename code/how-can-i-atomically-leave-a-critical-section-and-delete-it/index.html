<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I atomically leave a critical section and delete it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a thread which has entered a critical section. It has finished whatever it needs to do, and now it wants to leave the critical section and delete it. But wait, there’s a race condition here: Between the call to <code>Leave­Critical­Section</code> and <code>Delete­Critical­Section</code>, another thread might sneak in and enter the critical section. This means that the original thread is going to delete a critical section while there are threads waiting for it, which the documentation <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682552(v=vs.85).aspx">explicitly calls out as leaving the waiting threads in an undefined state</a>. </p>
<p>The question then is how to close this race window by performing the leave and delete atomically? </p>
<p>Actually, that’s the wrong question, because having such an atomic operation doesn’t fix anything. Suppose your thread calls that atomic leave-and-delete function. Now, the other interloper thread cannot enter the critical section after you leave and before you delete it. Yay, the race condition is gone! </p>
<p>But wait, you jumped out of the frying pan and landed in the fire: What’s going to happen is that the interloper thread will instead try to enter the critical section <i>after it has been deleted</i>, which also results in undefined behavior. </p>
<p>All you did was trade one undefined behavior for another. You didn’t actually fix anything. </p>
<p>If you have a system set up where there’s the possibility of a thread entering a critical section that is about to be deleted, then it means that you also have the possibility of a thread entering a critical section <i>after</i> it has been deleted. </p>
<p>So fix your design so that second problem no longer exists. Once you fix that, you’ll see that the original problem also vanishes. </p>
