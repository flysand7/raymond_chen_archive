<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A high waiter count on a free critical section may indicate a lock convoy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
If you’re debugging a performance problem in your application,
you may run across a critical section in a very strange state:
A lot of threads are waiting for it, but nobody owns it!
</p>
<pre>
0:000&gt; !critsec 0x10009C70
CritSec at 0x10009C70
LockCount          37
RecursionCount     0
OwningThread       0
</pre>
<p>
This state means that the previous owner of the critical section
has just exited it and signalled a waiting thread to take it,
but that thread hasn’t yet gotten a chance to run yet.
This is normally a transient condition,
but if you see it a lot, then you very likely the victim of a
lock convoy.
