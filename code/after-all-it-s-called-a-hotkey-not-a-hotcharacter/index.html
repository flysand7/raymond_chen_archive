<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">After all, it’s called a hotkey, not a hotcharacter</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was writing a remote access program, and they were having trouble injecting hotkeys into the system. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>We are sending the modified key as a scan code, and the base character as a Unicode character. We find that shortcuts of the form Modifier+Letter, such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, are not working. Are there known limitations for keyboard shortcuts sent as a scancode+Unicode character? </p>
<p>We are sending the base character as a Unicode character to avoid issues with localization and keyboard layouts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are based on virtual key codes, not Unicode characters. After all, it’s called a hotkey, not a hotcharacter. </p>
<p>Continuing the above example, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> hotkey is not a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> plus the Unicode character U+0041 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A). </p>
<p>You cannot hold the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key while typing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd> on the numeric keypad to get a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. </p>
<p>Even if CapsLock is off, you don’t have to hold the shift key to get a capital A. </p>
<p>For the hotkey <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>, you have to press the <kbd>1</kbd> on the main keyboard, not on the numeric keypad, even if NumLock is on. </p>
<p>Keyboard hotkeys consist of the applicable modifiers, combined with the key on the keyboard that has the appropriate symbol printed on it. Sending a Unicode character isn’t the same as simulating a press of a key on a keyboard. </p>
<p>You have to send the virtual key to complete the hotkey sequence. </p>
