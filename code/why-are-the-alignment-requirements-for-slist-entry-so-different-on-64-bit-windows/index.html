<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are the alignment requirements for SLIST_ENTRY so different on 64-bit Windows?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Interlocked­Push­Entry­SList</code> function stipulates that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ms684020.aspx"> all list items must be aligned on a <code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT</code> boundary</a>. For 32-bit Windows, <code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT</code> is 8, but the <code>SLIST_ENTRY</code> structure itself does not have a <code>DECLSPEC_ALIGN(8)</code> attribute. Even more confusingly, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/dd852148.aspx"> the documentation for <code>SLIST_ENTRY</code></a> says that the 64-bit structure needs to be 16-byte aligned but says nothing about the 32-bit structure. So what are the memory alignment requirements for a 32-bit <code>SLIST_ENTRY</code>, 8 or 4?
 It’s 8. No, 4. No wait, it’s both.
 Officially, the alignment requirement is 8. Earlier versions of the header file did not stipulate 8-byte alignment, and changing the declaration would have resulted in existing structures which (inadvertently) misaligned the field changing size and layout when the new requirement was imposed. So the 32-bit structure was sort-of grandfathered in. You should still align it on 8-byte boundaries, but the header file doesn’t enforce it to avoid breaking existing code.
 Fortunately, when the 64-bit version was introduced, the proper alignment directive was introduced right off the bat. How about that: sometimes Microsoft learns from its mistakes after all.
 Why are the alignment requirements greater than the natural word size? To avoid the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem"> ABA problem</a>. A standard workaround for the ABA problem is to append additional information (a “tag”) to the pointer so that when the value changes from B back to A, the tag ensures that the second A still looks different from the first one. Many CPU architectures have a “double-pointer-sized atomic compare-and-swap” instruction, and some of them have the additional requirement that the double-pointer needs to be on a double-pointer boundary (8 bytes for 32-bit pointers and 16 bytes for 64-bit pointers).
 “But wait, the double-pointer compare-and-swap is used on the <code>SLIST_HEADER</code>, not on the <code>SLIST_ENTRY</code>. Why does the <code>SLIST_ENTRY</code> need to be double-pointer aligned, too?”</p>
<p> While it’s true that many CPU architectures have a “double-pointer-sized atomic compare-and-swap” instruction, some support only a “pointer-sized atomic compare-and-swap”. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Older_implementations"> the original AMD64 architecture did not have a CMPXCHG16B instruction</a>; the largest data size for an atomic compare-and-swap was 8 bytes. As a result, the Slist functions need to pack a 64-bit pointer, a list depth, <i>and</i> tag information into a single 64-bit value. One of the tricks they used was imposing a memory alignment of 16 bytes. This freed up four bits in the pointer for use as a tag. </p>
