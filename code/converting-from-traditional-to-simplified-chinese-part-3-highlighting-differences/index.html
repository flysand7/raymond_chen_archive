<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Converting from traditional to simplified Chinese, part 3: Highlighting differences</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
One of the things that is interesting to me as a student of the
Chinese languages is to recognize where the traditional and
simplified Chinese scripts differ.
Since this is my program, I’m going to hard-code the color for
simplified Chinese script:  maroon.
</p>
<p>
To accomplish the highlighting, we take advantage of listview’s
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/custdraw/custdraw.asp">
custom-draw</a> feature.
Custom-draw allows you to make minor changes to the way items
are displayed on the screen.
It’s a middle ground between having listview do all the work
(via default drawing behavior) and having the program do all
the work (via owner-draw).
</p>
<p>
The custom-draw cycle for shell common controls consists of
series of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/custdraw/messages/nm_customdraw.asp">
<code>NM_CUSTOMDRAW</code> notifications</a>, starting with
the most general and getting more specific.
The reason for the break-down is multi-fold.
First, it allows the listview control to short-circuit a portion
of custom-draw behavior if the parent window does not indicate
that it wishes to customize a particular behavior.
This reduces message traffic and improves performance when large
numbers of items are being drawn.
Second, it allows the parent window to target its customizations
to the drawing stages it is interested in.
</p>
<p>
Listviews are peculiar among the shell common controls in that
its items sometimes (but not always) have sub-items.
This complicates the drawing process since it requires listview
to accomodate both styles:
large icon view does not use sub-items, but report view does.
To address this, the <code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT</code>
stage is entered when an item is about to paint,
and any changes made by the parent window are considered to
be effective for the entire item.
If you want to make changes on a per-subitem basis,
you have to respond to <code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT | CDDS_SUBITEM</code>
and set your properties (or reset them if you want to return to the
default) for that sub-item.
</p>
<p>
With those preliminary remarks settled, we can dive in.
</p>
<pre>
class RootWindow : public Window
{
 …
protected:
 …
 <font color="blue">LRESULT OnLVCustomDraw(NMLVCUSTOMDRAW* pcd);</font>
 …
private:
 HWND m_hwndLV;
 <font color="blue">COLORREF m_clrTextNormal;</font>
 Dictionary m_dict;
};
</pre>
<p>
We declare our listview custom-draw handler as well as the member
variable in which we remember the normal text color so that we can
reset it for columns we do not intend to colorize.
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT RootWindow::OnNotify(NMHDR *pnm)
{
 switch (pnm-&gt;code) {
 case LVN_GETDISPINFO:
  OnGetDispInfo(CONTAINING_RECORD(pnm, NMLVDISPINFO, hdr));
  break;
 case NM_CUSTOMDRAW:
  if (pnm-&gt;hwndFrom == m_hwndLV) {
   return OnLVCustomDraw(CONTAINING_RECORD(
                         CONTAINING_RECORD(pnm, NMCUSTOMDRAW, hdr),
                                                NMLVCUSTOMDRAW, nmcd));
  }
  break;
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
If we receive a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/custdraw/messages/nm_customdraw.asp">
<code>NM_CUSTOMDRAW</code> notification</a>
from the listview control, we call our new handler.
The multiple calls to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/kmarch/hh/kmarch/k106_6a249de6-d707-421c-9b91-96e1b14dc21b.xml.asp">
the <code>CONTAINING_RECORD</code> macro</a>
are necessary because
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/common/structures/nmhdr.asp">
the <code>NMHDR</code> structure</a> is nestled
two levels deep inside
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/listview/structures/nmlvcustomdraw.asp">
the <code>NMLVCUSTOMDRAW</code> structure</a>.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">LRESULT RootWindow::OnLVCustomDraw(NMLVCUSTOMDRAW* pcd)
{
 switch (pcd-&gt;nmcd.dwDrawStage) {
 case CDDS_PREPAINT: return CDRF_NOTIFYITEMDRAW;
 case CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT:
  m_clrTextNormal = pcd-&gt;clrText;
  return CDRF_NOTIFYSUBITEMDRAW;
 case CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT | CDDS_SUBITEM:
  pcd-&gt;clrText = m_clrTextNormal;
  if (pcd-&gt;iSubItem == COL_SIMP &amp;&amp;
    pcd-&gt;nmcd.dwItemSpec &lt; (DWORD)Length()) {
    const DictionaryEntry&amp; de = Item(pcd-&gt;nmcd.dwItemSpec);
    if (de.m_pszSimp) {
      pcd-&gt;clrText = RGB(0x80, 0x00, 0x00);
    }
  }
  break;
 }
 return CDRF_DODEFAULT;
}</font>
</pre>
<p>
During the <code>CDDS_PREPAINT</code> stage, we indicate our
desire to receive <code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT</code> notifications.
During the <code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT</code> stage,
we save the normal text color and indicate that we want to receive
sub-item notifications.
It is in the sub-item notification
<code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT | CDDS_SUBITEM</code> that the real work happens.
</p>
<p>
First, we reset the color to the default on the assumption that we
will not need to colorize this column.
But if the column is the simplified Chinese column, if the
item number is valid, and if the simplified Chinese is different
from the traditional Chinese, then we set the text color to maroon.
</p>
<p>
That’s enough with the Chinese/English dictionary for now.
All this time, and we don’t even have search capability yet!
We’ll work on that next month.
