<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can you create an information context for the display?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Adrian McCarthy asks, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#654530">Can you create an information context for the display?</a> … I can call CreateDC(“DISPLAY”), but perhaps that wouldn’t generalize for a multiple-monitor display with different settings on each screen. I’m trying to avoid constantly creating and destroying DCs when all I need to do is measure strings, check color depth, dpi, etc.”
 I admire the effort of trying to avoid creating a whole DC when all you want is to perform some inquiries. Some inquiries are monitor-independent, like getting the DPI or measuring strings, so you can just use <code>GetDC(NULL)</code> to get a temporary DC. This is cheaper than a full-on <code>CreateDC</code> since <code>GetDC</code> goes through <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/01/612970.aspx"> the DC cache</a>, so you’re just grabbing a DC out of the cache temporarily, doing a little computation, and then returning it to the cache (with <code>ReleaseDC</code>).
 If you are doing something that is monitor-specific, like getting its color depth, you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534598.aspx"> call <code>EnumDisplayMonitors</code> on the desktop DC</a> to look at each monitor.
 (And just for completeness, to get the name for a specific monitor if you really do want to create an IC for it, call <code>GetMonitorInfo</code> with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534807.aspx"> MONITORINFOEX</a> and look at the <code>szDevice</code> member.)</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Original text said “DC” in the last sentence by mistake. </p>
