<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I monitor, or even control, the lifetime of an Explorer window?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer wanted help with monitoring the lifetime of an
Explorer window.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We want to launch a copy of Explorer to open a specific folder,
then wait until the user closes the folder before continuing.
We tried launching a copy of Explorer with the folder on the
command line, then doing a <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code>
on the process handle, but the wait sometimes completes immediately
without waiting.
How do we wait until the user closes the Explorer window?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is another case of solving a problem halfway and then
having trouble with the other half.
</p>
<p>
The reason that <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code>
returns immediately
is that Explorer is a single-instance program (well, limited-instance).
When you open an Explorer window, the request is handed off to
a running copy of Explorer, and the copy of Explorer you launched
exits.
That’s why your <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code>
returns immediately.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the customer was willing to explain their underlying
problem.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We have a wizard that creates some files in a directory
based on information provided by the user,
and we want to launch Explorer to view that directory
so users can verify that things
are set up the way they want them.
When users close the Explorer window, we ask them if everything
was good; if not, then we back up and let the user try again.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Aha, the program is using Explorer as a “view this folder for
a little while” subroutine.
Unfortunately, Explorer doesn’t work that way.
For example, the user might decide to use the Address Bar
and go visit some other folders completely unrelated to your
program, and your program would just be sitting there waiting
for the user to close that window;
meanwhile, the user doesn’t realize that your program is waiting
for it.
</p>
<p>
What you can do is host the Explorer Browser control inside
a page of your wizard
and control it with interfaces like
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645992.aspx">
<code>IExplorer­Browser</code></a>.
You can disable navigation in the Explorer Browser
(so the user can look only at the folder
you want to preview),
and the user can click <i>Back</i> if they want to try again
or <i>Next</i> if they are happy and want to continue.
This has the additional advantage of keeping all the parts of
your wizard inside the wizard framework itself,
allowing users to continue using the wizard navigation model
that they are already familiar with.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940357.aspx">
sample program which uses the Explorer Browser control</a>
can be found in the Platform SDK.
</p>
<p>
For the impatient, here’s the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a> version.
Note that this is the minimal version;
in real life, you would probably want to set some options and stuff like that.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
IExplorerBrowser *g_peb;</font>
void
OnSize(HWND hwnd, UINT state, int cx, int cy)
{
<font color="blue">    if (g_peb) {
        RECT rc = { 0, 0, cx, cy };
        g_peb-&gt;SetRect(NULL, rc);
    }</font>
}
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
<font color="blue">    BOOL fSuccess = FALSE;
    RECT rc;
    PIDLIST_ABSOLUTE pidl = NULL;
    if (SUCCEEDED(CoCreateInstance(CLSID_ExplorerBrowser, NULL,
                         CLSCTX_INPROC, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;g_peb))) &amp;&amp;
        GetClientRect(hwnd, &amp;rc) &amp;&amp;
        SUCCEEDED(g_peb-&gt;Initialize(hwnd, &amp;rc, NULL)) &amp;&amp;
        SUCCEEDED(SHParseDisplayName(
                         L"C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer",
                                        NULL, &amp;pidl, 0, NULL)) &amp;&amp;
        SUCCEEDED(g_peb-&gt;SetOptions(EBO_NAVIGATEONCE)) &amp;&amp;
        SUCCEEDED(g_peb-&gt;BrowseToIDList(pidl, SBSP_ABSOLUTE))) {
        fSuccess = TRUE;
    }
    ILFree(pidl);
    return fSuccess;</font>
}
void
OnDestroy(HWND hwnd)
{
    <font color="blue">if (g_peb) {
        g_peb-&gt;Destroy();
        g_peb-&gt;Release();
    }</font>
    PostQuitMessage(0);
}
</pre>
<p>
This same technique of hosting the Explorer Browser control
can be used for other types of “build your own burrito” scenarios:
For example, you might
host the Explorer Browser control in a window and tell users
to copy files into that window.
When they click OK or Next or whatever, you can enumerate
the contents of the folder and do your business.
</p>
<p>
Armed with this knowledge, you can answer these customers’ questions:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We have found that the process state of Explorer.exe changes to signaled
<i>before</i> the process terminates.
Here’s a sample program:
</p>
<pre>
int _tmain(int argc, TCHAR **argv)
{
 STARTUPINFO si = { sizeof(si) };
 PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
 if (CreateProcess(TEXT("C:\\Windows\\Explorer.exe"), TEXT(" /e,C:\\usr"),
                   NULL, NULL, FALSE, 0, NULL, NULL, &amp;si, &amp;pi)) {
  WaitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess);
  CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
  CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
If we change “Explorer.exe” to “Notepad.exe” then the process handle
is signaled after Notepad terminates, as expected.

We have a 32-bit shell extension for which a 64-bit version is not
available.
Since our clients are running 64-bit Windows,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/29/10069021.aspx">
the 32-bit shell extension is not available in Explorer</a>.
How can we obtain access to this context menu?
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We have a shell extension that is not UAC-compliant.
It requires that the user have administrative privileges in order
to function properly.
We would rather not disable UAC across the board just for this
one shell extension.
Is there a workaround that lets us run Explorer elevated temporarily?

If you really just want to watch Explorer windows rather than
host one,
you can use

the ShellWindows object</a>,
something I covered
