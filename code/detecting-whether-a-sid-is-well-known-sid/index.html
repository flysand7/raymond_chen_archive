<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Detecting whether a SID is well-known SID</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
You might think that the <code>Is­Well­Known­Sid</code>
function would tell you whether a SID is well-known, but it doesn’t.
Rather,
it tells you whether a SID exactly matches the well-known SID
you specified.
For example, you can ask,
“Is this the <i>Authenticated Users</i> SID?”
or
“Is this the <i>Everyone</i> SID?”
But you can’t ask,
“Is this any type of well-known SID?”
</p>
<p>
I guess you could enumerate through all the well-known SIDs,
and check if your SID matches any of them,
but that’s getting kind of ugly.
</p>
<p>
If what you’re interested in is
whether this is a machine-relative SID
(or a domain-relative SID, which is the special case where the machine
is the domain controller),
as opposed to a universal SID,
you can check whether the SID format is S-1-5-<b>21</b>-#-#-#-#.
All machine-relative SIDs have that form.
</p>
<pre>
#define SECURITY_NT_NON_UNIQUE          (0x00000015L) // decimal 21
#define SECURITY_NT_NON_UNIQUE_SUB_AUTH_COUNT  (3L)
</pre>
<p>
If you want to exclude
<code>machine\Administrator</code> and
other predefined machine-relative SIDs,
you can verify that the last number
(the RID) is greater than or equal to 1000.

<pre>
#define SECURITY_OTHER_ORGANIZATION_RID (0x000003E8L)
