<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I get the number of processors in the system, when there are more than 64?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer noted that the way their program obtains the number of processors is by calling <code>Get­System­Info</code> and looking at the <code>dwNumberOfProcessors</code>. However, the documentation notes that this gives the number of processors in the current processor group, and that can be less than the total number of processors.</p>
<p>For example, when they checked the <code>dwNumberOfProcessors</code> on a system with 80 processors (lucky them), they found that it reported only 40 processors.</p>
<p>How can they get the total number of processors across all processor groups?</p>
<p>The easy way is to call <code>Get­Active­Processor­Count</code> with the <code>ALL_</code><code>PROCESSOR_</code><code>GROUPS</code> parameter. This counts up all processors across all groups.</p>
<p>The hard way is to call <code>Get­Logical­Processor­Information­Ex</code> and ask for <code>Relation­Group</code>. Then go through all the active groups and add up all of the <code>Active­Processor­Count</code>s. This is more work, but you also get to see the distribution of the processors among the groups, if that’s something you’re interested in.</p>
