<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What other effects does DS_SHELLFONT have on property sheet pages?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Once you invent a new flag you can start using it to fix errors of the past
without breaking backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
One of the errors of the past was that property sheet page dimensions
were taken relative to the “MS Sans Serif” font, even if the page
used some other font.
</p>
<pre>
DLG_SAMPLE DIALOGEX 32, 32, 212, 188
CAPTION "Caption"
FONT "Lucida Sans Unicode"
...
</pre>
<p>
This sample dialog template says that it is 212dlu wide and 188dlu tall.
If the dialog template were used for a standalone dialog, those
DLU values would be calculated relative to the font on the dialog,
namely Lucida Sans Unicode.
</p>
<p>
However, if the dialog template were used for a property sheet page,
earlier versions of Windows would interpret the values
212 and 188 relative to the font of the
<strong>property sheet frame</strong> (usually MS Sans Serif),
not relative to the font associated with the page itself.
Many people worked around this problem by giving their pages
pre-adjusted sizes, so that when Windows measured the dialog against
MS Sans Serif, the adjustments cancelled out.
</p>
<p>
In other words, suppose that Lucida Sans Unicode is 25% wider
than MS Sans Serif.  (I’m just making up numbers.)
Then to get a 212dlu-wide dialog relative to Lucida Sans Unicode,
the dialog template would specify a width of
212dlu + 25% = 265dlu.
</p>
<p>
Since people were now relying on this behavior, it couldn’t be
changed.  If you went in and “fixed” it, all those pre-adjusted
dialogs would come out at the wrong size.
</p>
<p>
Ah, but now there is a new flag, <code>DS_SHELLFONT</code>.
Starting in Windows 2000, if you specify the
<code>DS_SHELLFONT</code> dialog style for your <code>DIALOGEX</code>
dialog template, then the dialog dimensions are taken relative to
the font you specified in your template
(<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.controls/msg/87e77f5b7818cfd7">which is probably what you wanted</a>)
rather than relative to the property sheet frame font.
If you leave off the flag (as older programs will), then the
property sheet measurement code remains bug-for-bug compatible
with previous versions.</p>
