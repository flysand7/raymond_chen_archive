<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What a drag: You can be a drag in managed code, too</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/"> David Anson</a> digests <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/What+a+drag/default.aspx"> my earlier series on virtual drag/drop</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2009/10/26/creating-something-from-nothing-developer-friendly-virtual-file-implementation-for-net.aspx"> translates it into managed code</a>. His example of dragging his entire RSS feed is an excellent illustration of dragging dynamically-generated virtual content. (I didn’t use an example like that because the purpose of the <i>What a drag</i> series was to get something done in the least amount of code, and generating a stream from a URL takes an awful lot of code when doing it from the unmanaged side, which would ultimately detract from the point of the example.) </p>
<p> Bonus: He takes the example further by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2009/11/04/creating-something-from-nothing-asynchronously-developer-friendly-virtual-file-implementation-for-net-improved.aspx"> adding asynchronous support</a>. </p>
