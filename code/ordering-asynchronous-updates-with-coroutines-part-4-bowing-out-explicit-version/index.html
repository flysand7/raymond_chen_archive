<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Ordering asynchronous updates with coroutines, part 4: Bowing out, explicit version</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, we looked at the “Everybody tries, but only one wins” pattern, in which everyone calculates a result, but only the last one gets to save it. While this does work, we noted that there’s an inefficiency: Every calculation runs to completion, even if it has been superseded.</p>
<p>We can address that problem by re-checking after every coroutine resumption whether we have already lost. If so, we just give up.</p>

    std::lock_guard guard{ m_mutex };
    return counter = m_counter;
}</span>

winrt::IAsyncAction Widget::RecalcAsync()
{
    auto lifetime = get_strong();

    uint32_t counter;
    winrt::hstring messageId;
    winrt::hstring lang;
    {
        std::lock_guard guard{ m_mutex };
        counter = ++m_counter;
        messageId = m_messageId;
        lang = m_lang;
    }

    auto resolved = co_await ResolveLanguageAsync(lang);
    <span style="color: blue;">if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;</span>
    auto library = co_await GetResourceLibraryAsync(resolved);
    <span style="color: blue;">if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;</span>
    auto message = library.LookupResourceAsync(messageId);
    <span style="color: blue;">if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;</span>

    std::lock_guard guard{ m_mutex };
    if (m_counter == counter) {
        m_message = message;

<p>After every <code>co_await</code>, we check whether our counter is still current. If not, then it means that while we were <code>co_await</code>ing, somebody else started a <code>Refresh­Async</code> which caused our refresh to become obsolete. Instead of proceeding with the work, only to reject it at the end, we just stop immediately.</p>
<p>The last <code>Keep­Going­After­Await()</code> check is redundant because we’re going to check one last time inside the lock, but I wrote it out anyway.</p>
<p>As we observed earlier, we can get rid of the locks if all accesses to the members are on a single thread.</p>
<pre>bool Widget::KeepGoingAfterAwait(uint32_t counter)
{
    return counter = m_counter;

winrt::IAsyncAction Widget::RecalcAsync()
{
    auto lifetime = get_strong();

    uint32_t counter;
    winrt::hstring messageId;
    winrt::hstring lang;
    {
        std::lock_guard guard{ m_mutex };
        counter = ++m_counter;
        messageId = m_messageId;
        lang = m_lang;
    }

    auto resolved = co_await ResolveLanguageAsync(lang);
    if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;
    auto library = co_await GetResourceLibraryAsync(resolved);
    if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;
    auto message = library.LookupResourceAsync(messageId);
    if (!KeepGoingAfterAwait(counter)) co_return;

    m_message = message;
}
</pre>
<p>I removed the final check of the <code>m_counter</code>, since it is redundant with the <code>Keep­Going­After­Await()</code> that immediately precedes it.</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll see how this pattern is already covered by existing functionality.</p>
