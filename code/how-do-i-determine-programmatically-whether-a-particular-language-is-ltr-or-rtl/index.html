<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I determine programmatically whether a particular language is LTR or RTL?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Given an <code>LCID</code>, how does one determine whether the language lays out left-to-right or right-to-left? One suggestion was simply to hard-code the list of known right-to-left languages, and if the language isn’t on the list, then assume that it is left-to-right. This technique is clearly fragile, because Windows adds support for new languages not infrequently, and if one of those is a right-to-left language, then your table is now out of date. And besides, there are languages whose layout is neither left-to-right nor right-to-left. For example, Chinese and Japanese traditionally lay out top-to-bottom.
 To obtain the text layout direction programmatically, call <code>Get­Locale­Info­Ex</code> with <code>LOCALE_IREADINGLAYOUT</code>.</p>
