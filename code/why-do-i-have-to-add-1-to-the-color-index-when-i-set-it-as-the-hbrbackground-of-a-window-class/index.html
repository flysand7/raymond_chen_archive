<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do I have to add 1 to the color index when I set it as the hbrBackground of a window class?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Our
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
sets the background color to <code>COLOR_WINDOW</code>
by setting the class background brush as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    wc.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH)(COLOR_WINDOW + 1);
</pre>
<p>
What’s with the <code>+1</code>?
</p>
<p>
Okay, first of all, let’s backtrack a bit.
</p>
<p>
The real first question is,
“What’s the deal with taking an integer (<code>COLOR_WINDOW</code>)
and casting it to a <code>HBRUSH</code> and expecting anything sane
to happen?”
</p>
<p>
The window manager wants to provide multiple ways of setting the class
background brush.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The application can request
    that no automatic background drawing should occur at all.
<li>The application can request
    custom background drawing and provide that custom drawing by handling
    the <code>WM_ERASE­BKGND</code> message.
<li>The application can request that the background be a specific brush
    provided by the application.
<li>The application can request that the background be a specific system color.
</li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
The first three cases are easy:
If you don’t want automatic background drawing,
then pass
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/26/62991.aspx">
the hollow brush</a>.
If you want custom background drawing,
then pass <code>NULL</code> as the brush.
And if you want background drawing with a specific brush,
then pass that brush.
It’s the last case that is weird.
</p>
<p>
Now, if <code>Register­Class</code> were being invented today,
we would satisfy the last requirement
by saying,
“If you want the background to be a system color,
then use a system color brush like this:
</p>
<pre>
    wc.hbrBackground = GetSysColorBrush(COLOR_WINDOW);
</pre>
<p>System color brushes match the corresponding system color,
so this sets your background to whatever the current system
window color is.”
</p>
<p>
But just as
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/19/10117410.aspx">
NASA couldn’t use the Space Shuttle to rescue the Apollo 13 astronauts</a>,
the
<code>Register­Class</code> function couldn’t use
<code>Get­Sys­Color­Brush</code> for class brushes:
At the time
<code>Register­Class</code> was designed,
system color brushes had not yet been invented yet.
In fact, they won’t have been invented for over a decade.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, <code>Register­Class</code> had to find some
way of smuggling an integer inside a pointer,
and the traditional way of doing this is to say that
certain numerically-small pointer values are actually integers
in disguise.
We’ve seen this with
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/05/590749.aspx">
the <code>HINSTANCE</code> returned by
<code>Shell­Execute</code></a>,
with
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/01/8445487.aspx">
the <code>MAKE­INT­ATOM</code> macro</a>,
with the
<code>MAKE­INT­RESOURCE</code>/<code>IS_INT­RESOURCE</code>
macro pair,
and with the second parameter to the
<code>Get­Proc­Address</code> function.
(There are plenty of other examples.)
</p>
<p>
The naïve solution would therefore be to say,
“Well, if you want a system color to be used as the brush color,
then just cast the <code>COLOR_XXX</code> value to
an <code>HBRUSH</code>,
and the <code>Register­Class</code> function will recognize it
as a smuggled integer and treat it as a color code rather than an
actual brush.”
</p>
<p>
And then you run into a problem:
The numeric value of
<code>COLOR_SCROLL­BAR</code> is zero.
Casting this to a <code>HBRUSH</code> would result in a
<code>NULL</code> pointer,
but a <code>NULL</code> brush already means something else:
Don’t draw any background at all.
</p>
<p>
To avoid this conflict, the <code>Register­Class</code>
function artificially adds 1 to the system color number
so that none of its smuggled integers will be mistaken for
<code>NULL</code>.</p>
