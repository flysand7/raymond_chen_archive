<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you ask for STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED, you may as well ask for the moon</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One of the predefined security access masks is
<code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>.
You see it used in defining the <code>_ALL_ACCESS</code> masks for
various objects.
Here are just a few examples:
</p>
<pre>
#define PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS        (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | SYNCHRONIZE | \
                                   0xFFF)
#define EVENT_ALL_ACCESS (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED|SYNCHRONIZE|0x3)
#define FILE_ALL_ACCESS (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | SYNCHRONIZE | 0x1FF)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> mask is meant to be used
when defining access masks for object types.
I’m guessing it’s called <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> because
it’s the set of access masks that all securable objects must support.
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379607.aspx">
Look at the documentation</a>
or just at the definition:
</p>
<pre>
#define DELETE                           (0x00010000L)
#define READ_CONTROL                     (0x00020000L)
#define WRITE_DAC                        (0x00040000L)
#define WRITE_OWNER                      (0x00080000L)
#define STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED         (0x000F0000L)
</pre>
<p>
Notice that <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> is just
an abbreviation for the union of the four access bits
<code>DELETE | READ_CONTROL | WRITE_DAC | WRITE_OWNER</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now that you see what it’s for,
you can also see what it’s <strong>not</strong> for:
You’re not expected to pass it as the mask of <strong>requested</strong>
access bits when you attempt to open an object.
In other words, the following is wrong:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// wrong!
HANDLE hProcess =
    OpenProcess(dwProcessId, FALSE,
                STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION);</i>
</pre>
<p>
The person writing this code probably thought,
“Well, I just want to be able to query information, so I need to
pass <code>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION</code>.
There’s this other thing here called <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>;
since it’s required, I’ll pass that too.”
</p>
<p>
The “required”ness of <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> doesn’t
apply to you, the program opening the object.
It applies to the person who is designing the object.
</p>
<p>
Your attempt to be a “good security citizen” and ask only for the
access you need (namely, <code>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION</code>)
has backfired due to the addition of <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>.
If you ask for
<code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>,
you are asking for <strong>everything</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Why is that?
Notice that <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> includes
<code>WRITE_DAC</code>.
If you have <code>WRITE_DAC</code> permission, that means that you
have permission to
change the security descriptor on the object,
at which point you totally 0wnz0r it.
You want <code>PROCESS_VM_WRITE</code> access but the security
descriptor doesn’t let you?
No problem.
Just set a new security descriptor that grants you
<code>PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS</code> to the process object.
Tada! You now have all the access in the world.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story:
Don’t ask for <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>,
because only somebody with full control will be able to get it.
Ask for what you actually want.</p>
