<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I print non-error messages during compilation?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Worf remarked,  “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/09/8370479.aspx#8374137">My one wish is that <code>#warning</code> would be supported</a>.”
  I always find it interesting when people say  “I wish that Microsoft  would stop following standards,”  since the <code>#warning</code> directive is nonstandard.
  The Microsoft C/C++ compiler implements the feature in  a method compatible with the standard,  namely via a <code>#pragma</code> directive.
<code>  #pragma message("You really shouldn't be doing that.")  </code>
  If you want to warn people away from deprecated functionality,  you can use  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c8xdzzhh.aspx">  the <code>#pragma deprecated()</code> directive</a>  or the even more convenient (but more standards-troublesome)  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/044swk7y.aspx"> <code>__declspec(deprecated)</code> declaration specifier</a>.  The declaration specifier is much more convenient than the preprocessor  directive because you can use it in a macro,  and you can attach it to specific overloads of a function.  (It’s also more standards-troublesome because, while it is still  permitted by the standard because it begins with a double-underscore,  it is also not required to be ignored by compilers which do not  understand it.)</p>
<p>  In my experience, however, printing messages during compilation is  of little consequence.  Print all the messages during compilation as you want;  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2011/05/03/nobody-ever-reads-the-event-logs.aspx">  nobody will read them</a>.  The only thing that gets attention is an actual warning or error.  (And in many cases, only the error will get any attention at all.)  </p>
