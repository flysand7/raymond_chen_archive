<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Beware the C++ implicit conversion</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s topic was inspired by a question from a customer:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I am working on a stack overflow bug.
To reduce the size of the stack frame,
I removed as many local variables as I could,
but there’s still a a lot of stack space that I can’t
account for.
What else lives on the stack aside from local variables,
parameters, saved registers, and the return address?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Well, there’s also structured exception handling information,
but that’s typically not too much and therefore wouldn’t
be the source of “a lot” of mysterious stack usage.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that the code is generating lots of large C++ temporaries.
Consider the following program fragment:
</p>
<pre>
class BigBuffer
{
public:
 BigBuffer(int initialValue)
   { memset(buffer, initialValue, sizeof(buffer)); }
private:
 char buffer[65536];
};
extern void Foo(const BigBuffer&amp; o);
void oops()
{
 Foo(3);
}
</pre>
<p>
“How does this code even compile?
The function <code>Foo</code> wants a <code>BigBuffer</code>,
not an integer!”
Yet compile it does.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the compiler is using the <code>BigBuffer</code>
constructor as a converter.
In other words, the compiler inserted the following temporary
variable:
</p>
<pre>
void oops()
{
 BigBuffer temp(3);
 Foo(temp);
}
</pre>
<p>
It did this because a constructor that takes exactly one argument
serves two purposes:
It can be used as a traditional constructor (as we saw with
<code>BigBuffer temp(3)</code>)
or it can be used to provide an implicit conversion from the
argument type to the constructed type.
In this case, the <code>BigBuffer(int)</code> constructor is
being used as a conversion from <code>int</code> to <code>BigBuffer</code>.
</p>
<p>
To prevent this from happening, use the <code>explicit</code> keyword:
</p>
<pre>
class BigBuffer
{
public:
 <font color="blue">explicit</font> BigBuffer(int initialValue)
   { memset(buffer, initialValue, sizeof(buffer)); }
private:
 char buffer[65536];
};
</pre>
<p>
With this change, the call to <code>Foo(3)</code> raises a
compiler error:
</p>
<pre>
sample.cpp: error C2664: 'Foo' : cannot convert parameter 1 from
     'int' to 'const BigBuffer &amp;'
     Reason: cannot convert from 'int' to 'const BigBuffer'
     Constructor for class 'BigBuffer' is declared 'explicit'
</pre>
