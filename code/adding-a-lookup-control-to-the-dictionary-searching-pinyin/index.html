<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Adding a lookup control to the dictionary: Searching Pinyin</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Finally we start searching.
For now, the search algorithm is going to be very simple:
The string you type into the edit control will be treated as the
start of a Pinyin word or phrase.
We’ll make it fancier later.
</p>
<p>
Here is where a lot of the groundwork
(<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/19/420038.aspx">some of which I called out explicitly</a>
and some of which I slipped in without calling attention to it)
starts to pay off.
</p>
<p>
Up until now, the items in the listview came directly from the
dictionary.
Of course, when a word is being looked up, we want to reduce the
list to those that match the word or phrase being searched for.
We will introduce a new member <code>m_vMatch</code> which is
a vector of pointers to the items we actually want to display.
</p>
<pre>
class RootWindow : public Window
{
 …
 <font color="blue"><strike>// const DictionaryEntry&amp; Item(int i) { return m_dict.Item(i); }
 // int Length() { return m_dict.Length(); }</strike>
 const DictionaryEntry&amp; Item(int i) { return *m_vMatch[i]; }
 int Length() { return m_vMatch.size(); }</font>
 …
 <font color="blue">void OnCommand(UINT id, UINT cmd);
 void Refilter();</font>
 …
private:
 …
 <font color="blue">vector&lt;const DictionaryEntry*&gt; m_vMatch;</font>
};
</pre>
<p>
By tweaking our <code>Item</code> and <code>Length</code> member
functions, we can now render out of the list of matches instead of
out of the entire dictionary.
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT RootWindow::OnCreate()
{
 …
 <font color="blue"><strike>// ListView_SetItemCount(m_hwndLV, Length());</strike></font>
 …
 m_hwndLastFocus = m_hwndEdit;
 <font color="blue">m_vMatch.reserve(m_dict.Length());
 Refilter();</font></pre></p>
<p> return 0;
}

<p>
Since the list of matches is at most the number of words in the
dictionary, we can reserve that size up front and avoid needless
reallocations.
Once we’ve done that, we call our new <code>Refilter</code> method
to compute the matches (which populates the listview).
It is <code>Refilter</code> that will do the
<code>ListView_SetItemCount</code>, so there’s no point in us
doing it here.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">void RootWindow::OnCommand(UINT id, UINT cmd)
{
 switch (id) {
 case IDC_EDIT:
  switch (cmd) {
  case EN_CHANGE:
   Refilter();
  }
  break;
 }
}</font></pre></p>
<p>  // add to RootWindow::HandleMessage()
  <font color="blue">case WM_COMMAND:
   OnCommand(GET_WM_COMMAND_ID(wParam, lParam),
             GET_WM_COMMAND_CMD(wParam, lParam));
   break;</font>

<p>
We also rebuild the list of matches if the user makes a change
to the edit control.
This means that there is no need for a “Search” button.
The listview auto-filters as you type.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">void RootWindow::Refilter()
{
 WCHAR szBuf[256];
 DWORD cchBuf = GetWindowText(m_hwndEdit, szBuf, 256);
 m_vMatch.clear();
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_dict.Length(); i++) {
  const DictionaryEntry&amp; de = m_dict.Item(i);
  if (StrCmpNIW(de.m_pszPinyin, szBuf, cchBuf) == 0) {
   m_vMatch.push_back(&amp;de);
  }
 }
 ListView_SetItemCount(m_hwndLV, Length());
 ListView_SetItemState(m_hwndLV, -1, 0, LVIS_SELECTED);
 InvalidateRect(m_hwndLV, NULL, FALSE);
}</font>
</pre>
<p>
Building the list of matches is rather simple and anticlimactic.
We get the string the user typed into the edit control and
walk through all the words in the dictionary, seeing if the
Pinyin begins with the user’s typing.
If so, then we add it to the match vector.
</p>
<p>
Once the match list is built up, we tell the listview
how many we found, clear the selection (so that the selection
doesn’t appear to move around from one word to another
as items are filtered in or out), and invalidate the client
rectangle to trigger a repaint.
</p>
<p>
That’s all there is to it.
If you run this program and start typing into the edit control,
you’ll see the list of words in the listview grow and shrink as
you type.
</p>
<p>
That’s all for this month.
Next month, we’ll work on expanding the scope of the search.
</p></p>
