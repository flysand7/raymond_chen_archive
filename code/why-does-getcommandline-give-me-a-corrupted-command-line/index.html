<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does GetCommandLine give me a corrupted command line?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had the following problem:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’re calling <code>GetCommandLine</code> to retrieve the command line, and the documentation says that it returns a single null-terminated string. However, when we call it in our application, we find that it is actually a <i>double</i>-null-terminated string. The buffer returned consists of a series of null-terminated strings, one string per word on the command line, all stored one after the other, and with two null terminators at the end. How do I get the original string? </p></blockquote>
<p> Recall that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/23/9440784.aspx"> the command line is just a conveniently-initialized variable in a process</a> and once it’s set up, the kernel doesn’t really care about it any more.
 What is most likely happening is that somebody is taking the raw command line returned by <code>GetCommandLine</code> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/25/9928372.aspx"> writing to it</a>. The customer can confirm this by dumping the command line just as the process starts, even before any DLLs get to run their <code>DllMain</code>s, and then setting a write breakpoint on the command line to see who is writing to it.</p>
<p> And in fact, the customer did find the culprit. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It turns out it was some other part of the code (not written by me!) which was parsing the command line and writing into it in the process. </p></blockquote>
