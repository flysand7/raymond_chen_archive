<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do I get notified for changes to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT when nobody is writing to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer had a question about the
<code>Reg­Notify­Change­Key­Value</code> function.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We are using it to monitor the
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code> tree as follows:
</p>
<pre>
RegNotifyChangeKeyValue(
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
    true, // monitor entire subtree
    REG_NOTIFY_CHANGE_NAME | REG_NOTIFY_CHANGE_LAST_SET,
    eventRegKeyChanged,
    true); // asynchronous mode
</pre>
<p>
If I understand the documentation correctly,
this registers for notifications when subkeys are added,
deleted, or when values are changed.
However, it seems that my event becomes signaled at many
other times,
for example, when I switch folders in an Explorer window.
I fired up Process Monitor and confirmed that nobody (not even
Explorer) is writing to <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code>.
</p>
<p>
Why are we getting spurious notifications?
Have we misunderstood what this function does?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Everything is working as expected;
it’s just that your expectations are wrong.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code> registry key
is really a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724475(v=VS.85).aspx">
combined view of
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> and
<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code></a>.
Specifically, it is a combined view of
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes</code> and
<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes</code>.
And
<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes</code>
is itself just an alias for
<code>HKEY_USERS\«SID»_Classes</code>.
Therefore, if you’re going to look in
Process Monitor,
you need to be looking at all of those locations to see changes
that eventually get reported as changes in
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code>.
</p>
<p>
In this particular case, Explorer was making changes to
<code>HKEY_USERS\«SID»_Classes\Local Settings</code>,
which shows up as
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings</code>.
</p>
<p>
Upon receiving this explanation, the customer understood what
was going on, and also remarked that they were going to look to
see if they could register their notification on a location that
isn’t quite so broad.</p>
