<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The difference between thread-safety and re-entrancy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
An operation is “thread-safe” if it can be performed from multiple
threads safely, even if the calls happen simultaneously on multiple
threads.
</p>
<p>
An operation is re-entrant if it can be performed while the operation
is already in progress (perhaps in another context).
This is a <strong>stronger</strong> concept than thread-safety,
because the second attempt to perform the operation can even come
<strong>from within the same thread</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following function:
</p>
<pre>
int length = 0;
char *s = NULL;
// Note: Since strings end with a 0, if we want to
// add a 0, we encode it as "\0", and encode a
// backslash as "\\".
// WARNING! This code is buggy - do not use!
void AddToString(int ch)
{
  EnterCriticalSection(&amp;someCriticalSection);
  // +1 for the character we're about to add
  // +1 for the null terminator
  char *newString = realloc(s, (length+1) * sizeof(char));
  if (newString) {
    if (ch == '\0' || ch == '\\') {
      AddToString('\\'); // escape prefix
    }
    newString[length++] = ch;
    newString[length] = '\0';
    s = newString;
  }
  LeaveCriticalSection(&amp;someCriticalSection);
}
</pre>
<p>
This function is thread-safe because the critical section prevents
two threads from attempting to add to the string simultaneously.
However, it is not re-entrant.
</p>
<p>
The internal call to AddToString occurs while the data structures
are unstable.  At the point of the call, execution re-enters
the start of the function AddToString, but this time the attempt
to realloc the memory will use a pointer (s) that is no longer valid.
(It was invalidated by the call to realloc performed by the caller.)</p>
