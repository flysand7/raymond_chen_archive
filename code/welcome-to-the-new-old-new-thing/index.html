<p>Hey there, everybody. It’s going to take me a while to settle in, so please be patient. It seems I always celebrate a new blog by designing some insane multi-part series on some obscure aspect of Win32, so I think I’ll welcome this site with a series of articles that demonstrate various things you can do with the shell namespace. I haven’t planned it out yet, though, so I don’t know how many parts it’ll be or how much I’ll manage to cover before I get bored.</p>
