<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Returning values from a dialog procedure</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
        For some reason, the way values are returned from a dialog procedure confuses people,
        so I’m going to try to explain it a different way.
    </p>
<p>
        The trick with dialog box procedures is realizing that they actually need to return <b>two</b> pieces
        of information:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
            Was the message handled?
        </li>
<li>
            If so, what should the return value be?
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
        Since two pieces of information have to be returned, but a C function can have only
        one return value, there needs to be some other way to return the second piece of information.
    </p>
<p>
        The return value of the dialog procedure is whether the message was handled. The second
        piece of information – what the return value should be – is stashed in the DWLP_MSGRESULT
        window long.
    </p>
<p>
        In other words, DefDlgProc goes something like this:
    </p>
<pre>LRESULT CALLBACK DefDlgProc(
    HWND hdlg, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    DLGPROC dp = (DLGPROC)GetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_DLGPROC);
    SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT, 0);
    BOOL_PTR fResult = dp(hdlg, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
    if (fResult) return GetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT);
    else ... do default behavior ...
}
</pre>
<p>
        If you return anything other than 0, then the value you set via <code>SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg,
        DWLP_MSGRESULT, value)</code> is used as the message result.
    </p>
<p>
        For example, many WM_NOTIFY notifications allow you to override default behavior by
        returning TRUE. To prevent a listview label from being edited, you can return TRUE
        from the LVN_BEGINLABELEDIT notification. But if you are doing this from a dialog
        procedure, you have to do this in two steps:
    </p>
<pre>    SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT, TRUE);
    return TRUE;
</pre>
<p>
        The second line sets the return value for the dialog procedure, which tells DefDlgProc
        that the message has been handled and default handling should be suppressed. The first
        line tells DefDlgProc what value to return back to the sender of the message (the
        listview control). If you forget either of these steps, the desired value will not
        reach the listview control.
    </p>
<p>
        Notice that <code>DefDlgProc</code> sets the DWLP_MSGRESULT to zero before sending
        the message. That way, if the dialog procedure neglects to set a message result explicitly,
        the result will be zero.
    </p>
<p>
        This also highlights the importance of calling <code>SetWindowLongPtr</code> <b>immediately</b> before
        returning from the dialog procedure and no sooner. If you do anything between setting
        the return value and returning TRUE, that may trigger a message to be sent to the
        dialog procedure, which would set the message result back to zero.
    </p>
<p>
<b>Caution</b>: There are a small number of “special messages” which do not follow
        this rule. The list is given in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/DialogBoxReference/DialogBoxFunctions/DialogProc.asp">the
        documentation for DialogProc</a>. Why do these exceptions exist? Because when the
        dialog manager was first designed, it was determined that special treatment for these
        messages would make dialog box procedures easier to write, since you wouldn’t have
        to go through the extra step of setting the DWLP_MSGRESULT. Fortunately, since those
        original days, nobody has added any new exceptions. The added mental complexity of
        remembering the exceptions outweigh the mental savings of not having to write one
        line of code (“SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT, desiredResult)”).
