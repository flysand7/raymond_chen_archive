<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What kind of apartment is the private apartment I created via <code>CLSID_<code></code>Context­Switcher</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I talked about how you can <a href="/none/yo-dawg-i-hear-you-like-com-apartments-so-i-put-a-com-apartment-in-your-com-apartment-so-you-can-com-apartment-while-you-com-apartment"> create COM apartments inside COM apartments</a>. I forgot to mention what kind of apartment you get.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, the resulting private context has the same apartment model as the apartment that created it. If you are executing on a thread in a single-threaded apartment, and you create a <code>CLSID_<code></code>Context­Switcher</code>, then the resulting context is also a single-threaded apartment. Conversely, if you are executing on a thread in a multi-threaded apartment, then the resulting context is also multi-threaded.</p>
