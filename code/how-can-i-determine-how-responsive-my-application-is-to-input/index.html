<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I determine how responsive my application is to input?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was adding diagnostics to their application and wanted to know if there was a way to detect that the application was being slow in processing its input. These sorts of delays manifest themselves to the end user as a sluggish application which is slow to respond to input events.
 They already had a watchdog timer that was reset every time their <code>Get­Message</code> call returned a message, so they could capture stack traces if their application stopped processing messages for more than X milliseconds. They wanted to extend this diagnostic information to input delays.
 Fortunately, there’s an easy way to tell. The <code>Get­Message­Time</code> will tell you the time the message was added to the queue, so by subtracting that time from the current <code>Get­Tick­Count</code>, you can determine how long the input message sat in the queue. (Sent messages are not queued messages, so calling <code>Get­Message­Time</code> for a sent message doesn’t work.)
 There’s a catch, here, though.</p>
<p> Since mouse messages are generated on demand, the <code>Get­Message­Time</code> for a <code>WM_MOUSE­MOVE</code> message is usually “Just now.” (It could be older if you forced a mouse move message to be generated but left it in the queue.) To get the actual time the mouse moved, you need to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/14/10282406.aspx"> use <code>Get­Mouse­Move­Points­Ex</code></a>. </p>
