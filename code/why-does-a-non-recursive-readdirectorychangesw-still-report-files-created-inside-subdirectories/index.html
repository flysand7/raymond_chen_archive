<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does a non-recursive <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> still report files created inside subdirectories?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer used the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function to monitor a directory for changes, asking for notifications only for changes directly in the directory being monitored (<code>bWatchSubtree = false</code>). But they found that the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function reported a change even when they created a file in a subdirectory, rather than in the directory being monitored. </p>
<p>For example, if they asked to monitor the directory <code>C:\dir1</code>, and a file was created at <code>C:\dir1\dir2\file</code>, the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function reported a change, even though the file was created in a subdirectory, and the request was for a non-recursive monitor. </p>
<p>What gives? </p>
<p>We saw <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110812-00/?p=9913">some time ago</a> that the purpose of the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function is to allow you to maintain a local copy of the contents of a directory: The idea is that you make an initial pass over the directory with <code>Find­First­File</code>/<code>Find­Next­File</code>, and then you use the notifications from the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function to make incremental updates to your local copy. </p>
<p>And what happened here is that the contents of an enumeration of the <code>C:\dir1</code> directory did in fact change. What changed is the last-modified date on <code>C:\dir1\dir2</code>! </p>
