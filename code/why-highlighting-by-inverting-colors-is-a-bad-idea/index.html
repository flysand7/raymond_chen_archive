<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why highlighting by inverting colors is a bad idea</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         Often people will say, “Oh, we can highlight by inverting the color.”      </p>
<p>         This may have worked great on two-color black-and-white displays, but in the world         of 32-bit color this no longer is effective.      </p>
<p>         Consider the following picture. See if you can guess which one is inverted.      </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: center" width="100">
<tbody>
<tr bgcolor="#808080">
<td style="padding: 10px">

</td>
<td style="padding: 10px">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One</td>
<td>Two</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>         Answer: The one on the right is inverted.      </p>
<p>         The background color is gray, #808080. The box labelled “two” is highlighted by inversion.         The inverse of #808080 is #7F7F7F, which is practically the same color.      </p>
<p>     Even if your eyes happen to be good enough to spot the difference, it’s still not     a very obvious difference.  </p>
