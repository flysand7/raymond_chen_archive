<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How is it that WriteProcessMemory succeeds in writing to read-only memory?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you call <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> and tell it to write to memory that is read-only, the <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> succeeds. How can that be? </p>
<p>Because <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> tries really hard to please you. </p>
<p>As I noted some time ago, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120808-00/?p=6913">the primary audience for functions like <code>Create­Remote­Thread</code> and <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> is debuggers</a>. And when debuggers try to patch memory, it’s often for things like patching in a breakpoint instruction or doing some <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue?view=vs-2015">edit-and-continue</a> magic. So the <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> tries really hard to get those bytes written. If the page is read-only, <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> temporarily changes the permission to read-write, updates the memory, and then restores the original permission. </p>
<p>“No need to thank me, just trying to help.” </p>
<p>There is a race condition if the target process happens to be manipulating the page protection at the same time that <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> is. But that’s okay, because the intended audience is debuggers, and debuggers will freeze the target process before trying to edit its memory. </p>
<p>There is no security hole here, because the way the <code>Write­Process­Memory</code> function changes the page protection is basically <code>Virtual­Protect­Ex</code>, so it will succeed only if you already could have modified the protections yourself anyway. If you didn’t have permission to change the protections, then <code>Write­Process­Memory</code>‘s attempt to change the protections would fail too. </p>
