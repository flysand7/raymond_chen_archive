<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the format of the data in the AudioBuffer memory buffer, and how do I convert it to something else?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.AudioBuffer"> Windows Runtime AudioBuffer class</a> represents a buffer of audio data. What is the format of this data?</p>
<p>The memory buffer you <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.audiobuffer.createreference"> obtain from the AudioBuffer object</a> takes the form of an array of audio samples. Each audio sample is a collection of IEEE single-precision floating point numbers which represent a linear range of waveform amplitude from −1.0 to +1.0.</p>
<p>In C#, this floating point format is known as <code>System.</code><code>Single</code>. In C++, it is typically represented by <code>float</code>.</p>
<p>Each sample contains one value for each channel, and the channels come in a specified order, described in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mmreg/ns-mmreg-waveformatextensible"> the documentation for the <code>WAVE­FORMAT­EXTENSIBLE</code> structure</a>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a dual-channel audio buffer, say stereo left/right. The table in the <code>WAVE­FORMAT­EXTENSIBLE</code> documentation says that the channels come in the order <i>left</i> then <i>right</i>. Therefore the values come in this order:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Sample index</th>
<th>Channel</th>
<th>Value index</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">0</td>
<td>Left</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">1</td>
<td>Left</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">2</td>
<td>Left</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>⋮</td>
<td>⋮</td>
<td>⋮</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some people call this interleaved format, but whether it’s interleaved depends on what color glasses you’re wearing.</p>
<p>It’s interleaved if you look at it from the point of view of a channel, since the data from one channel is interleaved with data from the other channels.</p>
<p>But it’s perfectly linear format if you look at it from the point of view of the samples, since all the data for one sample is packed together.</p>
<p>Okay, next question: How do you convert this to other formats?</p>
<p>Well, that depends on what other format you’re converting it to. If you’re converting to a linear format,¹ then you can perform a simple linear conversion. We know that the result is going to be <var>f</var>(x) = <var>a</var><var>x</var> + <var>b</var> for some values of <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>. We just need to figure out what those values are.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Substitute <var>x</var> = −1.0: </td>
<td><var>v</var><sub>min</sub> = <var>a</var> × (−1) + <var>b</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Substitute <var>x</var> = +1.0: </td>
<td><var>v</var><sub>max</sub> = <var>a</var> × (+1) + <var>b</var></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Solving the system of simultaneous equations gives</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><var>a</var> = (<var>v</var><sub>max</sub> − <var>v</var><sub>min</sub>)/2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><var>b</var> = (<var>v</var><sub>max</sub> + <var>v</var><sub>min</sub>)/2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There is an extra wrinkle to this formula: If the destination is an integer range, then the negative values will have one extra value of range compared to the positive values. For example, a 16-bit signed value will range from −32768 to + 32767. If we plug zero into the function, we get just <var>b</var>, which is the average between the high and low values, and which will be numerically −½ rather than zero.</p>
<p>I don’t know how audio people usually solve this problem. One option I’ve seen is to throw out the most negative value, so the effective range for a 16-bit signed value is −32767 to +32767. In that case, the formula simplifies to merely multiplying by <var>v</var>ₘₐₓ.</p>
<p>Maybe some audio people can tell me what they do here.</p>
<p>¹ There are nonlinear formats for audio data. For example, μ-law is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding"> companding</a> algorithm which uses a nonlinear formula in order to express a wider dynamic range in a small space, at a cost of resolution at the extremes.</p>
