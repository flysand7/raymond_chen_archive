<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the lpClass member of SHELLEXECUTEINFO used for?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported problems launching
the default Web browser with the
<code>Shell­Execute­Ex</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
  SHELLEXECUTEINFO sei = {0};
  sei.cbSize = sizeof(sei);
  sei.nShow = SW_SHOWNORMAL;
  sei.lpFile = TEXT("www.microsoft.com");
  sei.fMask = SEE_MASK_CLASSNAME;
  sei.lpVerb = TEXT("opennew");
  sei.lpClass = TEXT("htmlfile");
  ShellExecuteEx(&amp;sei);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
This fails with <code>sei.hInstApp = SE_ERR_FNF</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t pass the <code>SEE_MASK_CLASSNAME</code> flag and
leave <code>lpClass = NULL</code>,
then the <code>Shell­Execute­Ex</code> function will try to
figure out what your <code>lpFile</code> refers to,
looking at the file extension,
looking for the file on the <code>PATH</code>,
and if all else fails,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/13/512503.aspx">
trying some autocorrection</a>.
In this case, the customer was relying on the autocorrection,
since they left the <code>http://</code> prefix off their URL.
One of the default autocorrection rules is that if the item that couldn’t
be launched begins with <code>www</code>, then try again with
<code>http://</code> in front.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
if you pass an explicit <code>lpClass</code>,
then no name resolution is performed on the <code>lpFile</code>.
You’re saying “Don’t do any sniffing and poking and autocorrection.
I have already determined that this item should be executed according
to the rules specified for
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\htmlfile</code>,
so just follow the rules and don’t question me.”
</p>
<p>
No second-guessing means that the <code>Shell­Execute­Ex</code>
function shrugged its shoulders and said,
“Well, I don’t see a file called <code>www.microsoft.com</code>
in the current directory, so I will fail with a file-not-found error.”
</p>
<p>
If you pass an explicit class, then
<code>Shell­Execute­Ex</code> will
treat your <code>lpFile</code> as if it were a file of that type.
If you have something and you want all the standard detection logic
to kick in, then don’t specify a class.

<b>Bonus reading</b>:
The above program is simplified to illustrate the topic.
A real-life version of this program

needs some other scaffolding</a>.</p>
