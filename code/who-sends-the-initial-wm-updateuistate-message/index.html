<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/05/16/10419105.aspx">
Last time</a>,
we looked at the
confusingly-named
<code>WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE</code>
and
<code>WM_CHANGE­UI­STATE</code>
messages.
But how does the whole indicator thingie get off the ground?
</p>
<p>
The default state for a window is to show all indicators.
But as a special trick,
the dialog manager will send a
<code>WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE</code> message
with <code>UIS_INITIALIZE</code> after the dialog
has been initialized,
which turns off the indicators if the last input event
was a mouse event.
This is its way of inferring whether the dialog box was
triggered by a mouse or keyboard action
and setting the initial indicators accordingly.
(Note that if the user checked
<i>Underline keyboard shortcuts and access keys</i>,
then the dialog manager leaves the indicators enabled
regardless of the last input event.)
</p>
<p>
That special
<code>WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE</code> message
is what gives dialog boxes the extra special feature
of hiding the keyboard accelerators until you use the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
But notice that only the dialog manager does this.
If you want this behavior in your own non-dialog windows,
you will need to send the message yourself.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL MyWindow::OnCreate(…)
{
 … create and initialize any child windows …</pre></p>
<p> <font color="blue">// initialize indicators
 BOOL fAlwaysUnderline = FALSE;
 SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETKEYBOARDCUES, 0,
                      &amp;fAlwaysUnderline, 0);
 if (!fAlwaysUnderline) {
  SendMessage(this-&gt;m_hwnd, WM_UPDATEUISTATE,
              MAKEWPARAM(UIS_INITIALIZE, 0), 0);
 }</font>
}

<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Why is it important to create and initialize the child windows
before sending the
<code>WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE</code> message?
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Why can’t the window manager do this automatically
after <code>WM_CREATE</code> returns?
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Explain the behavior this customer observes.

<blockquote class="q">
We have a dialog box with three buttons.
Sometimes the dialog displays underlines for the hotkeys,
and sometimes it doesn’t.
I know about the feature which hides keyboard accelerators
by default, but that doesn’t explain why the setting gets
ignored sometimes.
The first time I show the dialog in my program,
I get the underlines, but the second and subsequent times,
I do not.
