<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I know I can change the color of the DC pen, but what about the other attributes?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I called out <a href="/code/what-is-the-dc-brush-good-for" title="What is the DC brush good for?"> the usefulness of the DC pen and DC brush</a>: They always exist, each DC gets one, and you can change their colors dynamically. They are handy when you have some operation that requires a brush or pen, and you don’t really want to create one, use it for the operation, and then destroy it.</p>
<p>In a way, the DC pen and DC brush let you pretend that there are no brushes or pens at all, just colors. If there’s an operation that requires a brush, you can pretend that it takes a color: Set the DC brush to that color, and then perform the operation with the DC brush.</p>
<pre>HBRUSH g_dcBrush = (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH);

int FillRect(HDC hdc, const RECT* rect, COLORREF color)
{
 color = SetDCBrushColor(hdc, color);
 auto result = FillRect(hdc, rect, g_dcBrush);
 SetDCBrushColor(hdc, color);
}
</pre>
<p>The DC brush is a solid color brush.</p>
<p>The DC pen is a solid pen of width zero, which means that it draws one device pixel. All other properties are at their defaults (round join, endcap round).</p>
<p>The only thing you can change about the DC brush and DC pen are their colors. The other attributes are locked. If you need a pen or brush with attributes different from the ones provided by the DC pen or brush, you’ll have to create your own brush. Sorry.</p>
