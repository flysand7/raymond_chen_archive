<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Turning anything into a fire-and-forget coroutine</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/code/expressing-fire-and-forget-coroutines-more-explicitly-or-how-to-turn-any-coroutine-into-fire-and-forget">Last time</a>, we wrote a helper function for converting an awaitable into a <code>winrt::</code><code>fire_</code><code>and_</code><code>forget</code>, as well as another helper function that takes a lambda that <i>returns</i> an awaitable, and which invokes the lambmda as a <code>winrt::</code><code>fire_</code><code>and_</code><code>forget</code>. </p>
<p>After I wrote the two functions, I wondered if I could unify them. Mostly because I wanted to use the same name <code>no_await</code> for both functions. </p>
<p>This took me down the horrible rabbit hole known as C++ template metaprogramming. I wanted two versions of the function, one that is used if the parameter is awaitable, and another that is used if the parameter is a functor. This led me to try using things like <code>std::</code><code>enable_</code><code>if</code> to detect which case I’m in, and that led to lots of frustration, especially because there’s no easy way to detect if a type is awaitable. My closest approach was </p>
<pre>
template&lt;typename T, typename Promise = std::void_t&lt;&gt;&gt;
struct is_awaitable : std::false_type {};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct is_awaitable&lt;T, std::void_t&lt;typename std::experimental::coroutine_traits&lt;T&gt;::promise_type&gt;&gt; : std::true_type {};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
inline constexpr bool is_awaitable_v = is_awaitable&lt;T&gt;::value;
</pre>
<p>which infers that a type is awaitable by sniffing whether it has an associated <code>promise_</code><code>type</code>. This isn’t foolproof, because some types like <code>winrt::</code><code>fire_</code><code>and_</code><code>forget</code> have a <code>promise_</code><code>type</code> that cannot be awaited. </p>
<p>My first realization was that I could flip the test. Instead of checking whether the argument is awaitable, I check whether it is invokable. </p>
<p>My second realization was that I didn’t have to do fancy template metaprogramming at all. I could take advantage of the new <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-tour-of-c-17-if-constexpr-3ea62f62ff65"><code>if constexpr</code> feature</a>. </p>
<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt;
fire_and_forget no_await(T t)
{
    if constexpr (std::is_invocable_v&lt;T&gt;)
    {
        co_await t();
    }
    else
    {
        co_await t;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Now you can use <code>no_</code><code>await</code> with awaitables or functors that return awaitables. </p>
<pre>
void Stuff()
{
  // Start this operation but don't wait for it to finish
  no_await(DoSomethingAsync());

  // Start this sequence of things and don't wait for
  // them to finish.
  no_await([=]() -&gt; IAsyncAction
  {
    co_await Step1Async();
    // Step 2 doesn't start until Step 1 completes.
    co_await Step2Async();
  });
}
</pre>
<p>On the other hand, for the case of the lambda passed to <code>no_</code><code>await</code>, you could just declare your lambda as returning a <code>winrt::</code><code>fire_</code><code>and_</code><code>forget</code>, and then you wouldn't need <code>no_</code><code>await</code>. </p>
<pre>
void Stuff()
{
  // Start this operation but don't wait for it to finish
  no_await(DoSomethingAsync());

  // Start this sequence of things and don't wait for
  // them to finish.
  invoke_async_lambda([=]() -&gt; winrt::fire_and_forget
  {
    co_await Step1Async();
    // Step 2 doesn't start until Step 1 completes.
    co_await Step2Async();
  });
}
</pre>
<p>But I like the fact that the first example uniformly uses the name <code>no_</code><code>await</code> to describe the concept of "I'm not going to wait for this thing to finish." And also I'm perhaps unduly attached to the cute name. </p>
