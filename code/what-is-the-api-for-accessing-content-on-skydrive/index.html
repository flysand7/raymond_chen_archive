<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the API for accessing content on SkyDrive?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The last time I mentioned programmatic access to SkyDrive was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/07/02/10181646.aspx"> last June</a>, where I noted that the interface was given the confusing name Messenger Connect. At least now they renamed it to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/ff621314"> Live Connect</a>, which is slightly less confusing.
 The SkyDrive folks have been pretty busy lately. A few days ago, <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare Obasanjo</a> <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2011/12/07/skydrive-apis-for-docs-and-photos-now-ready-to-cloud-enable-apps-on-windows-8-windows-phone-and-more.aspx"> announced a new Live Connect SDK</a>, which means that you now have even more ways of accessing your SkyDrive content programmatically. (I like how the block diagram screen shot still has the red underline squiggles under the word <i>skydrive</i>.) Check it out at the <a href="http://dev.live.com/"> Live Connect Developer Center</a>.
 You can <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-134C"> watch the //build/ presentation online</a> if you want to watch somebody try to write code on stage. (I don’t risk it myself. You may have noticed that none of my presentations involve on-stage typing!)</p>
