<p>
There are various ways of getting a monitor.
You can get the monitor from a point,
from a rectangle,
or from a window.
But how do you get the primary monitor?
</p>
<p>
The primary monitor is defined to be the one
which has (0, 0) as its origin.
Therefore,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/09/4300545.aspx">
one solution</a>
is
</p>
<pre>
HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 POINT ptZero = { 0, 0 };
 return MonitorFromPoint(ptZero,
                         MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}
</pre>
<p>
The desktop window by convention is deemed to reside
primarily on the primary monitor,
so you could also use this:
</p>
<pre>
HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 return MonitorFromWindow(GetDesktopWindow(),
                          MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}
</pre>
<p>
Or you could just pass the null window handle.
This is technically an illegal parameter,
but by specifying
<code>MONITOR_DEFAULT­TO­PRIMARY</code>,
you are saying,
“If anything goes wrong,
give me the primary monitor.”
</p>
<pre>
HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitor()
{
 return MonitorFromWindow(nullptr,
                          MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}
</pre>
<p>
In this case, we are intentionally going astray
because we want to kick in the
<code>MONITOR_DEFAULT­TO­PRIMARY</code>
behavior.</p>
