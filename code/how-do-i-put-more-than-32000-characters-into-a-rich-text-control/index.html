Last time we looked at loading an entire file into a rich text
control</a>.
The code runs great, until you try to use it to display a
license agreement provided by your legal department, and then
some paranoid user reports that they can’t read past page seven.
(What, somebody reads those things?)
What’s going on?
</p>
<p>
If you don’t specify otherwise,
the maximum number of characters in a
rich edit control is 32,767 charaters.
(This limit exists for compatibility with the original rich edit control.)
You can raise the limit with the <code>EM_EXLIMITTEXT</code> message.
Therefore, we need to slip the line
</p>
<pre>
SendMessage(hwnd, EM_EXLIMITTEXT, 0, -1);
</pre>
<p>
into the program before it calls
<code>FillRichEditFromStream</code>.

Next time, the mystery of rich edit printing.</p>
