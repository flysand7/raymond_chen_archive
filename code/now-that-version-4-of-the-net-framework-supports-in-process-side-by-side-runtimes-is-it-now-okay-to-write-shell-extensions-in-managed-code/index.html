<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Now that version 4 of the .NET Framework supports in-process side-by-side runtimes, is it now okay to write shell extensions in managed code?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, I wrote, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/18/1317290.aspx">Do not write in-process shell extensions in managed code</a>.” Since I originally wrote that article, version 4 of the .NET Framework was released, and one of the features of that version is that it supports in-process side-by-side runtimes. Does that mean that it’s now okay to write shell extensions in managed code?</p>
<p> The answer is still no. </p>
<p> The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd758089(v=vs.85).aspx"> Guidance for implementing in-process extensions</a> has been revised, and it continues the recommendation against writing shell extensions and Internet Explorer extensions (and other types of in-process extensions) in managed code, even if you’re using version 4 or higher. </p>
<p> Although version 4 addresses the side-by-side issue, it is still the case that the .NET Framework is a high-impact runtime, and that there are various part of COM interop in the .NET Framework that are not suitable for use in an extension model designed around native code. </p>
<p> Note that managed code remains acceptable for out-of-process extensions. </p>
