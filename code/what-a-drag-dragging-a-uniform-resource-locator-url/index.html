<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What a drag: Dragging a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/code/what-a-drag-dragging-text" title="What a drag: Dragging text"> Last time, we dragged some text around</a> and found that the text would be interpreted as a URL if you dropped it onto Firefox, but Internet Explorer was not as willing to accept it. Today, we’ll make the data object work for Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The only change is that we have to provide the URL in the form of a <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code> clipboard format rather than as <code>CF_TEXT</code>. Take the program from last time and make two changes. First, use the handy-dandy search-and-replace function to change <code>DATA_TEXT</code> to <code>DATA_URL</code> throughout. (This step isn’t technically necessary, but it’s nice to have the name match its usage.) The real work happens in this change to the constructor:</p>
<pre>CTinyDataObject::CTinyDataObject() : m_cRef(1)
{
  SetFORMATETC(&amp;m_rgfe[DATA_URL],
               RegisterClipboardFormat(CFSTR_SHELLURL));
}
</pre>
<p>That’s all; just change the clipboard format from <code>CF_TEXT</code> to <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code>. It is important to note that <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code> represents an ANSI string. Since “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738#section-2.2">URLs are written only with the graphic printable characters of the US-ASCII coded character set</a>,” there is no loss of expressiveness by restricting to ANSI.</p>
<p>Run this new program and now you can click in the client area and drag/drop the (invisible) object onto Internet Explorer, where it will navigate to Microsoft’s home page. (If your system supports Active Desktop, you can also drag/drop the invisible object to the desktop and create an Active Desktop component.)</p>
<p>Okay, so we have one version of the program that can drag a URL to Internet Explorer, and another version that can drag a URL to Firefox. Next time, we’ll combine them to have a single data object that can drop to both. It’s quite embarrassingly simple (because I planned it that way).</p>
