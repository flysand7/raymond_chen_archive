<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">More undocumented behavior and the people who rely on it: Output buffers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
For functions that return data,
the contents of the output buffer if the function fails are typically
left unspecified.
If the function fails, callers should assume nothing about the contents.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t stop them from assuming it anyway.
</p>
<p>
I was reminded of this topic after reading
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/03/06/386194.aspx">
Michael Kaplan’s story of one customer who wanted the output buffer
contents to be defined even on failure</a>.
The reason the buffer is left untouched is because many
programs assume that the buffer is unchanged on failure,
even though there is no documentation supporting this behavior.
</p>
<p>
Here’s one example of code I’ve seen (reconstructed) that relies
on the output buffer being left unchanged:
</p>
<pre>
<i>HKEY hk = hkFallback;
RegOpenKeyEx(…, &amp;hk);
RegQueryValue(hk, …);
if (hk != hkFallback) RegCloseKey(hk);
</i></pre>
<p>
This code fragment starts out with a fallback key then tries
to open a “better” key,
assuming that if the open fails,
the contents of the <code>hk</code> variable will be left unchanged
and therefore will continue to have the original fallback value.
This behavior is not guaranteed by the specification for
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/regopenkeyex.asp">
the <code>RegOpenKeyEx</code> function</a>, but that doesn’t stop people
from relying on it anyway.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another example
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cdexos/cdexos/Registry.cpp?rev=1.3">
from actual shipping code</a>.
Observe that the <code>CRegistry::Restore</code> method is documented
as “If the specified key does not exist, the value of ‘Value’ is unchanged.”
(Let’s ignore for now that the documentation uses registry
terminology incorrectly; the parameter specified is a value name,
not a key name.)
If you look at what the code actually does,
it loads the buffer with the original value of “Value”,
then calls
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/regqueryvalueex.asp">
the <code>RegQueryValueEx</code> function</a> twice
and ignores the return value both times!
The real work happens in the <code>CRegistry::RestoreDWORD</code>
function.
At the first call, observe that it initializes
the <code>type</code> variable, then calls
the <code>RegQueryValueEx</code> function and assumes that
it does not modify the
<code>&amp;type</code> parameter on failure.
Next, it calls
the <code>RegQueryValueEx</code> function a second time,
this time assuming that the output buffer
<code>&amp;Value</code> remains unchanged in the event of failure,
because that’s what <code>CRegistry::Restore</code> expects.
</p>
<p>
I don’t mean to pick on that code sample.
It was merely a convenient example
of the sorts of abuses that Win32 needs to sustain
on a regular basis for the sake of compatibility.
Because, after all, people buy computers in order to
run programs on them.
</p>
<p>
One significant exception to the “output buffers are undefined on failure”
rule is output buffers returned by COM interface methods.
COM rules are that output buffers are always initialized, even on failure.
This is necessary to ensure that the marshaller doesn’t crash.
For example, the last parameter to the IUnknown::QueryInterface method
must be set to NULL on failure.
