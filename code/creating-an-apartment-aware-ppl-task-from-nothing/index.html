<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Creating an apartment-aware PPL task from nothing</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) of the Concurrency Runtime, there are these things called <code>task</code>s. Some tasks are <i>apartment-aware</i>, which means that the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh749968.aspx#task_continuation_context::use_default Method">default continuation context</a> will execute the task continuation in the same COM apartment that queued the continuation. Otherwise, the task is not apartment-aware, which means that the default continuation context is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh749968.aspx#task_continuation_context::use_arbitrary Method">arbitrary</a>: The concurrency runtime will execute the task continuation in a thread of its choosing. </p>
<p>If you are working with objects that have thread affinity, you are operating on a single-threaded apartment (STA), and you need the continuation to run on that same thread so that you still have access to those objects. </p>
<p>The rule used by the Concurrency Runtime is that tasks which are derived from <code>IAsync­Action</code> or <code>IAsync­Operation&lt;T&gt;</code> are apartment-aware, and others are not. </p>
<p>Okay, so it’s easy to create a non-apartment-aware completed task. </p>
<pre>
Concurrency::task&lt;void&gt; completed_non_apartment_aware_task()
{
 return Concurrency::task_from_result();
}
</pre>
<p>There is already a function in the Parallel Patterns Library for creating a completed task, and the result is a non-apartment-aware task. </p>
<p>The hard part is creating an apartment-aware completed task. Here’s what I came up with: </p>
<pre>
Concurrency::task&lt;void&gt; completed_apartment_aware_task()
{
  Concurrency::create_task(Concurrency::create_async([]{}));
}
</pre>
<p>Working from the inside out: We start with a lambda that does nothing. We use <code>create_async</code> to wrap that lambda inside an <code>IAsync­Action</code>. Then we use <code>create_task</code> to wrap the <code>IAsync­Action</code> inside a <code>task</code>. </p>
<p>It’s not pretty, but it works. </p>
<p>Now you can write things like </p>
<pre>
    completed_apartment_aware_task()
    .then([this]()
    {
       // something
    }).then([this](int result)
    {
       // something
    });
</pre>
<p>and all of the <code>something</code>s will run on the same apartment as the code that started the task chain. </p>
<p>This is particularly handy when you want to run a task conditionally on a UI thread. For the branch where you don’t want a task, you still have to make one, and you want it to be apartment-aware, so that your UI code stays on the UI thread. </p>
<pre>
Concurrency::task&lt;void&gt; MaybeDoSomethingAsync()
{
  if (condition) {
    return Concurrency::create_task(...);();
  } else {
    return completed_apartment_aware_task();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>In the case where the condition is false, you still have to return a task, and you want it to be an apartment-aware task. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: This little detour through <code>IAsync­Action</code> is necessary only if you are using <code>concurrency::task::then()</code> to attach continuations. </p>
<p>If you use <code>co_await</code> with <code>Concurrency::task</code>, then the <code>pplawait.h</code> header file controls how the continuation is scheduled, and it uses <code>task_continuation_context::get_current_winrt_context()</code> to schedule the continuation, which means that the task continues in the same apartment. </p>
<p>If you use <code>co_await</code> with C++/winrt, then the continuation runs in the same apartment, although there are special awaitable objects for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/concurrency">explicitly moving between apartments</a>. </p>
