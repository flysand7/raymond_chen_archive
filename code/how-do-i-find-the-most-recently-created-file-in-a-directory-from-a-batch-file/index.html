<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I find the most recently created file in a directory from a batch file?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We’ve reached Hump Day of Batch File Week.
Remember, nobody actually likes batch programming.
You merely tolerate it.
</p>
<p>
Today, we’ll find the most recently-created item in a directory.
(For example, we have a server that holds our daily builds,
and you might want to write a batch file that automatically
installs the latest build.)
</p>
<p>
There may be better ways, but what I do is ask for a list
sorted oldest-to-newest,
and then choose the last one.
</p>
<pre>
for /f %%i in ('dir /b/a-d/od/t:c') do set LAST=%%i
echo The most recently created file is %LAST%
</pre>
<p>
This trick works by asking the <code>dir</code> command
to list just the names (<code>/b</code>)
of just the files <code>/a-d</code>,
sorted by date (<code>/od</code>),
based on the creation time (<code>/t:c</code>).
</p>
<p>
Each time a new file is reported,
its name is stored in the <code>LAST</code> variable,
overwriting the previous one.
When the loop finishes,
the <code>LAST</code> variable contains the name of the
newest file,
since that’s the one that didn’t get overwritten.
</p>
<p>
You can tweak the command line to perform other queries.
For example, if you want the newest file, then just ask
for a reverse sort (<code>/o-d</code>).
If you want the file sorted by modified time rather than
creation time,
then use <code>/t:w</code>.
You get the idea.
</p>
<p>
<b>Limitations</b>:
The implementation above
assumes that no files contain spaces in their name.
Removing this limitation is left as an exercise.</p>
