<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The various ways of sending a message</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There are several variations on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/messagesandmessagequeues/messagesandmessagequeuesreference/messagesandmessagequeuesfunctions/sendmessage.asp"> the SendMessage function</a>, but some are special cases of others.</p>
<p> The simplest version is SendMessage itself, which sends a message and waits indefinitely for the response. </p>
<p> The next level up is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/MessagesandMessageQueues/MessagesandMessageQueuesReference/MessagesandMessageQueuesFunctions/SendMessageTimeout.asp"> SendMessageTimeout</a> which sends a message and waits for the response or until a certain amount of time has elapsed. SendMessage is just SendMessageTimeout with an INFINITE timeout. </p>
<p> Another version of SendMessage is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/MessagesandMessageQueues/MessagesandMessageQueuesReference/MessagesandMessageQueuesFunctions/SendNotifyMessage.asp"> SendNotifyMessage</a>, which is like SendMessage except that it doesn’t wait for the response.  It returns immediately and ignores the result produced by the receiving window. </p>
<p> The last SendMessage-style functions is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/MessagesandMessageQueues/MessagesandMessageQueuesReference/MessagesandMessageQueuesFunctions/SendMessageCallback.asp"> SendMessageCallback</a>. This sends a message and then returns immediately. When the recipient finally returns a response, the callback is called. </p>
<p> SendNotifyMessage is SendMessageCallback with a callback that does nothing. </p>
<p> That’s how the four message-sending functions fit together. </p>
<p> Bonus remark: If you use any of the above send-type functions to send a message to a window that belongs to the sending thread, the call is made synchronously.  </p>
