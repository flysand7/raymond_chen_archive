<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When you think you found a problem with a function, make sure you’re actually calling the function, episode 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that the <code>Duplicate­Handle</code> function was failing with <code>ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE</code> even though the handle being passed to it seemed legitimate: </p>
<pre>
  // Create the handle here
  m_Event =
    ::CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE/*bManualReset*/,
                       FALSE/*bInitialState*/, NULL/*lpName*/));
  ... error checking removed ...


// Duplicate it here
HRESULT MyClass::CopyTheHandle(HANDLE *pEvent)
{
 HRESULT hr = S_OK;
 
 if (m_Event != NULL) {
  BOOL result = ::DuplicateHandle(
                GetCurrentProcess(),
                m_Event,
                GetCurrentProcess(),
                pEvent,
                0,
                FALSE,
                DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS
                );
  if (!result) {
    // always fails with ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
    return HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(GetLastError());
  }
 } else {
  *pEvent = NULL;
 }
 
 return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>The handle in <code>m_Event</code> appears to be valid. It is non-null, and we can still set and reset it. But we can’t duplicate it. </p>
<p>Now, before claiming that a function doesn’t work, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/08/01/10546597.aspx">you should check what you’re passing to it and what it returns</a>. The customer checked the <code>m_Event</code> parameter, but what about the other parameters? The function takes <i>three</i> handle parameters, after all, and they checked only one of them. According to the debugger, <code>Duplicate­Handle</code> was called with the parameters </p>

<p>Upon sharing this information, the customer immediately saw the problem: The other two handle parameters come from the <code>Get­Current­Process</code> function, and that function was returning <code>0x0aa15b80</code> rather than the expected pseudo-handle (which is currently <code>-1</code>, but that is not contractual). </p>
<p>The customer explained that their <code>My­Class</code> has a method with the name <code>Get­Current­Process</code>, and it was that method which was being called rather than the Win32 function <code>Get­Current­Process</code>. They left off the leading <code>::</code> and ended up calling the wrong <code>Get­Current­Process</code>. </p>
<p>By default, Visual Studio colors member functions and global functions the same, but you can change this in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/kw7t0545%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">the <i>Fonts and Colors</i> options dialog</a>. Under <i>Show settings for</i>, select <i>Text Editor</i>, and then under <i>Display items</i> you can customize the colors to use for various language elements. In particular, you can choose a special color for static and instance member functions. </p>
<p>Or, as a matter of style, you could have a policy of not giving member functions the same name as global functions. (This has the bonus benefit of reducing false positives when grepping.) </p>
<p><b>Bonus story</b>: A different customer reported a problem with visual styles in the common tab control. After a few rounds of asking questions, coming up with theories, testing the theories, disproving the theories, the customer wrote back: “We figured out what was happening when we tried to step into the call to <code>Create­Dialog­Indirect­ParamW</code>. Someone else in our code base redefined all the dialog creation functions in an attempt to enforce a standard font on all of them, but in doing so, they effectively made our code no longer isolation aware, because in the overriding routines, they called <code>Create­Dialog­Indirect­ParamW</code> instead of <code>Isolation­Aawre­Create­Dialog­Indirect­ParamW</code>. Thanks for all the help, and apologies for the false alarm.” </p>
