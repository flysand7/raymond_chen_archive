<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dark corners of C/C++: The typedef keyword doesn’t need to be the first word on the line</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Here are some strange but legal declarations in C/C++:
</p>
<pre>
int typedef a;
short unsigned typedef b;
</pre>
<p>
By convention, the <code>typedef</code> keyword comes at the
beginning of the line, but this is not actually required by the
language.
The above declarations are equivalent to
</p>
<pre>
typedef int a;
typedef short unsigned b;
</pre>
<p>
The C language (but not C++) also permits you to say
<code>typedef</code> without actually defining a type!
</p>
<pre>
typedef enum { c }; // legal in C, not C++
</pre>
<p>
In the above case, the <code>typedef</code> is ignored,
and it’s the same as just declaring the <code>enum</code>
the plain boring way.
</p>
<pre>
enum { c };
</pre>
<p>
Other weird things you can do with <code>typedef</code> in C:
</p>
<pre>
typedef;
typedef int;
typedef int short;
</pre>
<p>
None of the above statements do anything,
but they are technically legal in pre-C89 versions of the C language.
They are just alternate manifestations of the quirk in the
grammar that permits you to say <code>typedef</code> without
actually defining a type.
(In C89,
this loophole was closed:
Clause 6.7 Constraint 2
requires that “A declaration shall declare at least
a declarator, a tag, or the members of an enumeration.”)
</p>
<p>
That last example of <code>typedef int short;</code> is particularly
misleading,
since at first glance it sounds like it’s redefining the <code>short</code>
data type.
But then you realize that <code>int short</code> and
<code>short int</code> are equivalent,
and this is just an empty declaration of the <code>short int</code> data type.
It doesn’t actually widen your shorts.
If you need to widen your shorts,
go see a tailor.¹
<p>
Note that just because it’s legal doesn’t mean it’s recommended.
You should probably stick to using <code>typedef</code> the way
most people use it,
unless you’re looking to enter the
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.

And it’s not even my joke!
