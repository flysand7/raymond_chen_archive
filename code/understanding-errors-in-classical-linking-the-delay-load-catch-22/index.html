<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Understanding errors in classical linking: The delay-load catch-22</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Wrapping up our week of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/07/10382714.aspx">
understanding the classical model for linking</a>,
we’ll put together all the little pieces we’ve learned this week
to puzzle out a linker problem:
The delay-load catch-22.
</p>
<p>
You do some code cleanup,
then rebuild your project, and you get
</p>
<pre>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a5x38f99.aspx">LNK4199</a>: /DELAYLOAD:SHLWAPI ignored; no imports found from SHLWAPI
</pre>
<p>
What does this error mean?
</p>
<p>
It means that you passed a DLL via the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yx9zd12s.aspx">
<code>/DELAYLOAD</code> command line switch</a>
which your program doesn’t actually use,
so the linker is saying,
“Um, you said to treat this DLL special, but I don’t see that DLL.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, right,” you say to yourself.
“I got rid of a call to
<code>Hash­String</code>,
and that was probably the last remaining function
with a dependency on
<code>SHLWAPI.DLL</code>.
The linker is complaining that I asked to delay-load a DLL
that I wasn’t even loading!”
</p>
<p>
You fix the problem by deleting
<code>SHLWAPI.DLL</code> from the <code>/DELAYLOAD</code>
list,
and removing
<code>SHLWAPI.LIB</code> from the list of import libararies.
And then you rebuild, and now you get
</p>
<pre>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/799kze2z.aspx">LNK2019</a>: unresolved external ‘__imp__HashData’ referenced in function ‘HashString’
</pre>
<p>
“Wait a second, I stopped calling that function.
What’s going on!”
</p>
<p>
What’s going on is that the
<code>Hash­String</code> function got
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/08/10383017.aspx">
taken along for the ride</a>
by another function.
The order of operations in the linker is
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform classical linking
<li>Perform nonclassical post-processing
    <ul>
<li>Remove unused functions (if requested)
    <li>Apply <code>DELAYLOAD</code> (if requested)
    </li></li></ul>
</li></li></ul>
<p>
The linker doesn’t have a crystal ball and say,
“I see that in the future, the ‘remove unused functions’ step
is going to delete this function, so I can throw it away right now
during the classical linking phase.”
</p>
<p>
You have a few solutions available to you.
</p>
<p>
If you can modify the library, you can
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/10/10383642.aspx">
split the <code>Hash­String</code>
function out</a>
so that it doesn’t come along for the ride.
</p>
<p>
If you cannot modify the library,
then you’ll have to
use the <code>/IGNORE</code> flag to explicitly ignore the warning.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Another option is to leave <code>SHLWAPI.LIB</code>
in the list of import libraries,
but remove it from the <code>DELAYLOAD</code> list.
Why is this a dangerous option?
What can you do to make it less dangerous?
