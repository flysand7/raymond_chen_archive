<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">ERRORLEVEL is not %ERRORLEVEL%</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
The command interpreter <code>cmd.exe</code> has a concept
known as the <i>error level</i>,
which is the exit code of the program most recently run.
You can test the error level with the
<code>IF ERRORLEVEL</code> command:
</p>
<pre>
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 ECHO error level is 1 or more
</pre>
<p>
&lt;sidebar&gt;<br/>
The <code>IF ERRORLEVEL n</code> test succeeds
if the error level is n <i>or more</i>.
This was presumably because there were programs that
expressed different degrees of failure with higher and
higher exit codes.
For example, the <code>diff</code> program has three exit codes:
0 means the files are the same;
1 means the files are different;
2 means that something terrible happened.
There are also programs that use an exit code of zero
to mean success and anything else to mean failure.<br/>
&lt;/sidebar&gt;
</p>
<p>
In addition to this internal state,
you can, if you wish, create an environment variable
with the name <code>ERRORLEVEL</code>,
in the same way that you can create an environment variable
called <code>FRED</code>.
But, as with <code>FRED</code>,
that variable won’t have any effect on the error level.
</p>
<pre>
rem this next command sets the error level to zero
CMD /C EXIT 0
set ERRORLEVEL=1
if ERRORLEVEL 1 echo Does this print?
</pre>
<p>
The message is not printed because the <code>ERRORLEVEL</code>
environment variable has no effect on the error level.
It’s just a variable whose name happens to coincide with a command
processor concept.
</p>
<pre>
set BANKBALANCE=$1,000,000.00
</pre>
<p>
“Hey, when I tried to withdraw the money, I got an insufficient funds error.
What am I doing wrong?”
</p>
<p>
Now, it does happen to be the case that if command extensions are
enabled and you say
<code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code>, then the command processor first looks
for an environment variable called <code>ERRORLEVEL</code>,
and <i>if it can’t find one</i>, then it replaces <code>%ERRORLEVEL%</code>
with the current value of the internal error level value.
It’s a fallback step,
in the same way that your neighbor is a fallback delivery location if
you aren’t home.
If you file a change-of-address form for yourself, that doesn’t affect
packages sent to your neighbor.
</p>
<p>
The same behavior can be seen with <code>%CD%</code>:
If you did not explicitly set an environment variable called <code>CD</code>,
then <code>%CD%</code> expands to the command processor’s current
directory.
But you can’t change directories by saying <code>set CD=C:\Windows</code>.
</p>
<p>
I can think of a few reasons why this feature may have been added.
</p>
<ul>
<li>So you can include the error level in a log file:<br/>
<code>ECHO error level is %ERRORLEVEL%&gt;logfile</code>
<li>So you can perform other types of tests against the error level,
    for example, to perform an equality test:<br/>
<code>IF %ERRORLEVEL% EQU 1 echo Different!</code>
</li></li></ul>
<p>
But I’m digressing.
My point for today is that the error level is not the same
as the <code>ERRORLEVEL</code> environment variable.
</p></p>
