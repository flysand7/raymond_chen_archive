<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mundane std::tuple tricks: Selecting via an index sequence</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200622-00/?p=103880"> we combined tuples</a>. That’s relatively straightforward. Splitting them apart is harder.</p>
<p>The <code>std::index_sequence</code> is a standard type which captures a sequence of zero or more nonnegative integers into a type. It’s a special case of the <code>std::integer_sequence</code> which captures integer values of user-specified type, where the user-specified type is a <code>std::size_t</code>.</p>
<p>Tuple splitting boils down to a fold expression involving <code>std::index_sequence</code>.</p>
<pre>// Don't use this; see discussion.
template&lt;typename Tuple, std::size_t... Ints&gt;
auto select_tuple(Tuple&amp;&amp; tuple, std::index_sequence&lt;Ints...&gt;)
{
 return std::make_tuple(
    std::get&lt;Ints&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple))...);
}
</pre>
<p>This is the heart of tuple splitting, so let’s take it apart.</p>
<p>The first template type parameter is the tuple being manipulated. It is captured as a universal reference so that we can forward it. This preserves rvalue-ness, which is particularly important in case some of the types in the tuple are move-only. (It also helps if the types are both copyable and movable, because it will prefer the move, which is usually much less expensive than the copy.)</p>
<p>The remaining template parameters are <code>size_t</code> values, representing the indices in the <code>index_sequence</code>.</p>
<p>The fold expression is</p>
<pre>    (std::get&lt;Ints&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple))...)
</pre>
<p>which forms the parameter list to <code>make_tuple</code>. The expression is repeated once for each value in the <code>Ints...</code> parameter pack, resulting in a series of parameters which pluck the corresponding indexed values from the tuple.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>auto result = select_tuple(
    std::make_tuple('x', 3.14, 'z'),
    std::index_sequence&lt;2, 1, 1, 2&gt;{});
</pre>
<p>We take a three-element tuple <code>('x', 3.14, 'z')</code> and select from it the index sequence <code>&lt;2, 1, 1, 2&gt;</code>. The fold expression becomes</p>
<pre>    (std::get&lt;2&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple)),
     std::get&lt;1&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple)),
     std::get&lt;1&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple)),
     std::get&lt;2&gt;(std::forward&lt;Tuple&gt;(tuple)))
</pre>
<p>This extracts items 2, 1, 1, and 2 from the tuple, passing them to <code>make_tuple</code>, which recombines them into the resulting tuple <code>('z', 3.14, 3,14, 'z')</code>. Note that indices 1 and 2 were extracted multiple times, and index 0 was not extracted at all. Note also that the size of the resulting tuple matches the number of indices, not the size of the source tuple.</p>
<p>Note that if the values in the tuple had been a movable type (not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type"> movable type</a>), then extracting indices <code>&lt;2, 1, 1, 2&gt;</code> would have resulted in moving some of the items more than once. That’s probably not going to produce a happy result, so you don’t usually extract a value more than once. (Though there’s nothing stopping you.)</p>
<p>There’s a defect with our <code>select_</code><code>tuple</code> function, though. I alluded to it in the comment. We’ll address that defect next time.</p>
