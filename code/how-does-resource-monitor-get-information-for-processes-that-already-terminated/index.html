<p>How does the Resource Monitor program get information for processes that have already terminated? </p>
<p>Try it: Run Task Manager, then go to the Performance tab. From there, click <i>Open Resource Monitor</i>. Now run another program, say, Notepad. Let Notepad run for a while, and then close it. Observe that there is still an entry for <code>notepad.exe</code> in Resource Monitor, labeled <i>Terminated</i>. </p>
<p>What is the function to call to get performance statistics on a program that has terminated? </p>
<p>There is no function to get performance statistics for a program that has terminated. What you’re seeing is an optical illusion: Resource Monitor continues to show statistics for processes that have terminated, so that you can see the final results before they go away. </p>
<p>Here’s proof that it’s an illusion: After exiting Notepad and putting it into the grayed-out <i>Terminated</i> state in Resource Monitor, go back to Task Manager and click <i>Open Resource Monitor</i> again. This will open another instance of Resource Monitor, and in that new instance, you’ll see no trace of the terminated Notepad process. </p>
<p>Now you see it. Now you don’t. </p>
