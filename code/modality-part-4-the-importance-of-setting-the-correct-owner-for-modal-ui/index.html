<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Modality, part 4: The importance of setting the correct owner for modal UI</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
If you decide to display some modal UI, it is important that
you set the correct owner for that UI.  If you fail to heed
this rule, you will find yourself chasing some very strange bugs.
</p>
<p>
Let’s return to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
our scratch program</a> and intentionally introduce a bug
related to incorrect owner windows, so that we can see the
consequences.
</p>
<pre>
void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
  switch (ch) {
  case ' ':
    // Wrong!
    <i>MessageBox(NULL, TEXT("Message"), TEXT("Title"), MB_OK);</i>
    if (!IsWindow(hwnd)) MessageBeep(-1);
    break;
  }
}
// Add to WndProc
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CHAR, OnChar);
</pre>
<p>
Run this program, press the space bar, and instead of dismissing
the message box, click the “X” button in the corner of the main
window.  Notice that you get a beep before the program exits.
</p>
<p>
What happened?
</p>
<p>
The beep is coming from our call to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/debug/base/messagebeep.asp">
the <code>MessageBeep</code> function</a>,
which in turn is telling us that our window handle is no longer valid.
In a real program which kept its state in per-window instance variables
(instead of in globals like we do),
you would more likely crash
because all the instance variables would have gone away when the
window was destroyed.  In this case, the window was destroyed while
inside a nested modal loop.  As a result, when control returned to
the caller, it is now a method running inside an object that has been
destroyed.  Any access to an instance variable is going to access
memory that was already freed, resulting in memory corruption or an
outright crash.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an explanation in a call stack diagram:
</p>
<pre>
 WinMain
  DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
   OnChar
    MessageBox(NULL)
     ... modal dialog loop ...
     DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CLOSE)
      DestroyWindow(hwnd)
       WndProc(WM_DESTROY)
        ... clean up the window ...
</pre>
<p>
When you clean up the window, you typically destroy all the
data structures associated with the window.  But notice that
you are freeing data structures <strong>that are still being used</strong>
by the <code>OnChar</code> handler deeper in the stack.
Eventually, control unwinds back to the <code>OnChar</code>,
which is now running with an invalid instance pointer.
(If you believe in C++ objects, you would find that its “this”
pointer has gone invalid.)
</p>
<p>
This was caused by
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32/msg/850b8e9e80c4cbae">
failing to set the correct owner for the
modal <code>MessageBox</code> call</a>, allowing the user to
interact with the frame window at a time when the frame window
isn’t expecting to have its state changed.
</p>
<p>
Even more problematic, the user can switch back to the frame
window and hit the space bar again.  The result: Another
message box.  Repeat another time and you end up with a stack that
looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
 WinMain
  DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
   OnChar
    MessageBox(NULL)
     ... modal dialog loop ...
     DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
       OnChar
	MessageBox(NULL)
	 ... modal dialog loop ...
	 DispatchMessage(hwnd, WM_CHAR)
	   OnChar
	    MessageBox(NULL)
	     ... modal dialog loop ...
</pre>
<p>
There are now four top-level windows, all active.  If the user
dismisses them in any order other than the reverse order in
which they were created, you’re going to have a problem on your
hands.  For example, if the user dismisses the second message box
first, the part of the stack corresponding to that nesting level
will end up returning to a destroyed window when the third message
box is finally dismissed.
</p>
<p>
The fix is simple, and we’ll pick up there next time.</p>
