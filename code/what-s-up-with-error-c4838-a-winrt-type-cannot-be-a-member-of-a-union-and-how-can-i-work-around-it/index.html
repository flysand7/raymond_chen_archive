<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s up with error C4838: a WinRT type cannot be a member of a union, and how can I work around it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you try to put a Windows Runtime type inside a <code>std::optional</code> from C++/CX, you get this error:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">std::optional&lt;::Windows::Foundation::Rect&gt; optRect;

error C2848: 'std::_Optional_destruct_base&lt;_Ty,true&gt;::Value': A WinRT type cannot be a member of a union
</pre>
<p>Why can’t a WinRT type be a member of a union?</p>
<p>The C++/CX language extension was written back when the latest C++ standard was C++03, and in C++03, unions could not (among other things) contain objects that had a nontrivial destructor.</p>
<p>Windows Runtime types usually have destructors: Reference types use hat pointers which release the underlying ABI object at destruction. And structures might contain <code>String^</code>, which also entails a nontrivial destructor.</p>
<p>C++/CX just gives up and says, “Nope, not gonna do that.” It doesn’t bother to check whether the structure in question actually has a nontrivial destructor; it just assumes that it does, and the compiler won’t let you put it into a union. C++/CX won’t even let you put a Windows Runtime enum in a union!</p>
<p>Fortunately, C++/WinRT doesn’t have this problem. C++/WinRT is standard C++, and the compiler can see that the <code>Rect</code> structure is just a bunch of <code>float</code>s with no special destructor. Furthermore, C++/WinRT can take advantage of advances in the C++ language, such as permitting objects with destructors in unions.</p>
<pre>// compiles just fine
std::optional&lt;winrt::Windows::Foundation::Rect&gt; optRect;
</pre>
<p>Just one of many reasons why C++/CX is deprecated in favor of C++/WinRT.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: If you really need to put a C++/CX <code>Rect</code> into a union, you can wrap it inside another structure first.</p>
<pre>struct RectStruct
{
  ::Windows::Foundation::Rect rect;
};

std::optional&lt;RectStruct&gt; optRect;
</pre>
