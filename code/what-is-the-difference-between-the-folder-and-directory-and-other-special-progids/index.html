<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the difference between the Folder and Directory (and other special) progids?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When you’re installing your shell extension, you need to know which progid to hang it off of inside <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</code>. We’ll start with the title question and then move on to other predefined (but perhaps not well-known) progids. </p>
<ul>
<li>“Folder” is the progid for any shell folder.     It could be a virtual folder (like Control Panel)     or a file system folder (like C:\WINDOWS). </li>
<li>“Directory” is the progid for file system folders.     This is a subset of “Folder”. </li>
<li>“*” is the progid for all files.     Doesn’t matter what the extension is. </li>
<li>“.” (that’s a single period) is the progid for files without any extension. </li>
<li>“AllFileSystemObjects” is the union of “*” and “Directory”.     It is the progid for all files and for file system directories. </li>
</ul>
