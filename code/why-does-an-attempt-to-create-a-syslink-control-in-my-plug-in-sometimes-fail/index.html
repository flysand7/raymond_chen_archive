<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does an attempt to create a SysLink control in my plug-in sometimes fail?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had written a plug-in for some application, and they found that their plug-in was unable to create a SysLink control via the <code>Create­Window­ExW</code> function. The same code in a standalone application works fine, but when the code is placed in their plug-in, the code fails.
 Debugging showed that the call to <code>Init­Common­Controls­Ex</code> succeeded, but the <code>Create­Window­ExW</code> call failed with “Cannot find window class.”
 The customer is another victim of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/12/20/10379796.aspx"> not keeping their eye on the activation context</a>.
 They attached a manifest to their DLL so that the call to <code>Init­Common­Controls­Ex</code> maps to the version of the common controls library that supports the SysLink control. But they did nothing to ensure that that context was active at the time they called <code>Create­Window­ExW</code>.
 The customer’s plug-in clearly falls into the case <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#mmc"> <i>Adding Visual Style Support to an Extension, Plug-in, MMC Snap-in or a DLL That Is Brought into a Process</i></a>. but they failed to follow the instructions provided therein (which boil down to “use isolation awareness”).
 From the symptoms, it appears that the host application for their plug-in does not activate a version-6 common controls manifest at the time it calls into the plug-in, which means that your attempt to create version-6 common controls will fail.</p>
<p> On the other hand, the standalone application probably uses the technique given in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773175%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#no_extensions"> <i>Using ComCtl32.dll Version 6 in an Application That Uses Only Standard Extensions</i></a>, which activates the version-6 common controls when the process starts and <i>leaves it active</i> for the duration of the process. </p>
