<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I emulate the REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC flag on systems that don’t support it? part 5</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We complete our somewhat pointless exercise of <a href="/code/how-can-i-emulate-the-reg-notify-thread-agnostic-flag-on-systems-that-don-t-support-it-part-4"> emulating the <code>REG_<wbr/>NOTIFY_<wbr/>THREAD_<wbr/>AGNOSTIC</code> flag</a> by making our coroutine resilient to failure partway through. This requires you to accept the anachronism of using C++20 coroutines, while also dropping Windows XP support, since we will be relying on thread pool features new to Windows Vista.</p>

  HKEY hkey,

    void operator=awaiter(awaiter const&amp;) = delete;

      SubmitThreadpoolWork(m_completionWork);
      return 0;

    DWORD CALLBACK Complete(void* param)
    {

      return 0;
    }
  };

  return awaiter(hkey, bWatchSubtree, dwNotifyFilter, hEvent);

<p>The idea here is that we have two work items. The first (for which we use <code>Queue­User­Work­Item</code>) is scheduled onto a persistent thread. When that first work item runs (<code>Register</code>), we register the notification and save the result. And then we submit the second work item, which brings us to a normal thread pool thread, which is where we resume the caller by invoking its coroutine handle.</p>
<p>As before, if anything goes wrong during the set-up, we save the error and declare that the caller shouldn’t suspend. That way, it picks up the error immediately.</p>
<p>There’s a subtlety here: You might be tempted to clean up the completion work item as soon as <code>Submit­Threadpool­Work</code> returns, but that would be wrong. There is a race condition where the submitted work runs to completion before <code>Submit­Threadpool­Work</code> returns. In that case, the coroutine has already resumed, and the <code>awaiter</code> has already destructed. The subsequent call to <code>Close­Threadpool­Work(<wbr/>m_completionWork);</code> is accessing an object after it has been destroyed.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Commenter Paul Jackson <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201223-00/?p=104584#comment-137566"> observed that</a> the thread which executes <code>WT_<wbr/>EXECUTE­IN­PERSISTENT­THREAD</code> work items can exit if there are no pending I/O requests. Is RegNotifyChangeKeyValue a pending I/O request? I’m not sure. So maybe <code>WT_<wbr/>EXECUTE­IN­PERSISTENT­THREAD</code> doesn’t solve the problem after all. Fortunately, this was all a pointless exercise.</p>
