<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do we improve the performance of conhost processes when we ping a bunch of servers?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a program that launches many instances of the <code>ping</code> program in order to check the availability of a large number of servers. They found that each copy of <code>ping</code> comes with a copy of <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2009/10/05/windows-7-windows-server-2008-r2-console-host/">conhost.exe</a>, and all these <code>conhost</code> processes degrade system performance by a factor of four. They were looking for guidance on how they could improve the performance of the <code>conhost</code> process. </p>
<p>Well, the best way to avoid performance issues with <code>conhost</code> is to stop using <code>conhost</code>. </p>
<p>It sounds like the customer was launching the <code>ping</code> program and then either <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">parsing the output</a> or studying the exit code in order to determine whether the server was up. Instead, they could use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.networkinformation.ping.aspx">the <code>System.Net.Network­Information.Ping</code> class</a> (if programming in C#) or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa366050(VS.85).aspx">Icmp­Send­Echo function</a> (if programming in C/C++). Not only is this more efficient, you get detailed status results which will help you decide which server your program should use. </p>
<p>(Both functions report the ping time in milliseconds because <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161115-00/?p=94715">the speed of light is unlikely to improve</a>.) </p>
