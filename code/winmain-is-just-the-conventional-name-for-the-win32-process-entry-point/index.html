<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">WinMain is just the conventional name for the Win32 process entry point</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
<code>WinMain</code> is
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633559.aspx">
the conventional name for the user-provided entry point</a>
in a Win32 program.
Just like in 16-bit Windows, where the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/03/6644060.aspx">
complicated entry point requirements were converted by language-provided
startup code into a call to the the user’s <code>WinMain</code> function</a>,
the language startup code for 32-bit programs also does the work of
converting the raw entry point into something that calls
<code>WinMain</code>
(or <code>wWinMain</code> or <code>main</code> or <code>_wmain</code>).
</p>
<p>
The raw entry point for 32-bit Windows applications has a much simpler
interface than the crazy 16-bit entry point:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK RawEntryPoint(void);
</pre>
<p>
The operating system calls the function with no parameters,
and the return value (if the function ever returns) is passed
to the <code>ExitThread</code> function.
In other words, the operating system calls your entry point like this:
</p>
<pre>
...
  ExitThread(RawEntryPoint());
  /*NOTREACHED*/
</pre>
<p>
Where do the parameters to <code>WinMain</code> come from,
if they aren't passed to the raw entry point?
</p>
<p>
The language startup code gets them by asking the operating system.
The instance handle for the executable comes from
<code>GetModuleHandle(NULL)</code>,
the command line comes from <code>GetCommandLine</code>,
and the <code>nCmdShow</code> comes from
<code>GetStartupInfo</code>.
(As we saw before,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/15/156022.aspx">
the <code>hPrevInstance</code> is always <code>NULL</code></a>.)
</p>
<p>
If you want to be hard-core, you can program to the raw entry point.
Mind you, other parts of your program may rely upon the work that the
language startup code did before calling your <code>WinMain</code>.
For example, the C++ language startup code will run global constructors
before calling into <code>WinMain</code>,
and both C and C++ will initialze the so-called <i>security cookie</i>
used as part of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2007/04/03/hardening-stack-based-buffer-overrun-detection-in-vc-2005-sp1.aspx">
stack buffer overrun detection</a>.
Bypass the language startup code at your peril.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Notice that if you choose to return from your entry point function,
the operating system passes the return value to <code>ExitThread</code>
and not <code>ExitProcess</code>.
For this reason, you typically don't want to return from your raw
entry point but instead want to call <code>ExitProcess</code> directly.
Otherwise, if there are background threads hanging around, they will
prevent your process from exiting.</p>
