<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">C++ coroutines: Allowing the awaiter to be destroyed while suspended</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One issue that we dealt with when we created our <code>co_await</code> awaitable signal was <a href="/code/creating-other-types-of-synchronization-objects-that-can-be-used-with-co-await-part-3-parallel-resumption"> the case of the awaiter being destroyed while suspended</a>. We had been ignoring that problem in our coroutine promise, but we can’t keep our head in the sand forever. Let’s take a look around and see where we are.</p>
<p>And it turns out that getting rid of the reference count also fixes the problem of an awaiting coroutine being destroyed while suspended: If that happens, the <code>promise_ptr</code> in the awaiter is destructed, and that abandons the coroutine. This means that when the coroutine completes, it will see that nobody is awaiting and won’t try to resume a destroyed awaiting coroutine.</p>
<p>Procrastination pays off!</p>
