<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Loading the dictionary, part 4:  Character conversion redux</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Getting rid of <code>getline</code> was a big help, but 480ms
is still not quite peppy enough.  You need to respond to user
actions within a tenth of a second for thing to seem responsive.
</p>
<p>
Profiling the latest endeavor reveals that 40% of our CPU time
is spent in <code>codecvt::in</code>.  Some debugging reveals
that <code>codecvt::in</code> ultimately calls
<code>MultiByteToWideChar</code> but uses it to convert
only one or two characters at a time, even though we handed it a
whole line.
</p>
<p>
Let’s get rid of <code>codecvt::in</code> and convert the
characters ourselves, calling
<code>MultiByteToWideChar</code> exactly once to convert the
entire line at a single go.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">#define CP_BIG5 950</font>
Dictionary::Dictionary()
{
 MappedTextFile mtf(TEXT("cedict.b5"));
 <font color="blue"><strike>// typedef std::codecvt&lt;wchar_t, char, mbstate_t&gt; widecvt;
 // std::locale l(".950");
 // const widecvt&amp; cvt = _USE(l, widecvt); // use_facet&lt;widecvt&gt;(l);</strike></font>
 const CHAR* pchBuf = mtf.Buffer();
 const CHAR* pchEnd = pchBuf + mtf.Length();
 while (pchBuf &lt; pchEnd) {
  const CHAR* pchEOL = std::find(pchBuf, pchEnd, '\n');
  if (*pchBuf != '#') {
   size_t cchBuf = pchEOL - pchBuf;
   wchar_t* buf = new wchar_t[cchBuf];
   <font color="blue">DWORD cchResult = MultiByteToWideChar(CP_BIG5, 0,
                          pchBuf, cchBuf, buf, cchBuf);
   if (cchResult) {</font>
    wstring line(buf, <font color="blue">cchResult</font>);
    DictionaryEntry de;
    if (de.Parse(line)) {
     v.push_back(de);
    }
   }
   delete[] buf;
  }
  pchBuf = pchEOL + 1;
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Instead of using the <code>codecvt::in</code> method to perform
character conversion, we go straight to the
<code>MultiByteToWideChar</code> function.
Notice that we assume that the Big5 string will not generate
more Unicode characters than its length in bytes.
This happens to be a safe assumption based on our external knowledge
of the Big5 encoding.  (If the encoding were something else,
the assumption may no longer be valid.)
</p>
<p>
With this change, the dictionary load time has dropped to 240ms
(or 300ms if you include the time it takes to destroy the
dictionary).  That’s twice as fast the previous version, but still
not quite close enough to the 100ms goal.
We still have some work ahead of us.
