<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Use the #error directive to check whether the compiler even sees you</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
You may find yourself in a twisty maze of <code>#ifdef</code>s.
Or you may be wondering why your macros aren’t working.

I have these lines in my header file:
</p>
<pre>
#define MM_BUSY     0x0001
#define MM_IDLE     0x0002
</pre>
<p>
but when I try to use them, I get errors.
</p>
<pre>
sample.cpp(23): error C2065: 'MM_BUSY': undeclared identifier
sample.cpp(40): error C2065: 'MM_IDLE': undeclared identifier
</pre>
<p>
Any idea why this is happening?

<p>
First, make sure the compiler even sees you.
Notice that for macros, generating a preprocessed file
doesn’t accomplish anything since <code>#define</code>s don’t
show up in the preprocessor output.
(They are preprocessor <i>input</i>.)
What I do is use the <code>#error</code> directive.
Add it to the header file and recompile.
</p>
<pre>
#define MM_BUSY     0x0001
#define MM_IDLE     0x0002
#error Did we get here?
</pre>
<p>
If you get
</p>
<pre>
sample.h(80) : error C1189: #error :  Did we get here?
</pre>
<p>
then you know that the line is indeed being compiled
and that somebody after you is doing an <code>#undef MM_BUSY</code>.
If not, then you get to investigate why the lines in the header
file are being ignored.
For example,
they might be hidden by an <code>#ifdef</code>,
or (if you’re using Visual Studio with precompiled headers),
your <code>#include</code> directive might be ignored due to an
overriding precompiled header directive.
You can scatter <code>#error</code> directives into other parts
of the header file (or other header files) to narrow down why
your lines are being skipped.</p>
