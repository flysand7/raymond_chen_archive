<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When I tell the file or folder picker that I want only file system files and folders, why does it still show virtual folders?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You can ask a file picker dialog to limit itself to files in the file system by passing the <code>FOS_</code><code>FORCE­FILE­SYSTEM</code> flag. There is an analogous <code>BIF_</code><code>RETURN­ONLY­FS­DIRS</code> flag for the folder picker.</p>
<p>But if you pass this flag, you’ll still see virtual folders in the user interface. Things like <i>Network</i> and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><i>My Computer</i></span> <i>This PC</i>. And if the user picks it, the OK button grays out, which is confusing. Why are these virtual folders showing up when I explicitly asked that they not show up?</p>
<p>Well, that’s not what you asked.</p>
<p>You asked that the user be able to select only file system files or folder. You didn’t ask that non-file-system object be removed from view.</p>
<p>But why are these non-file-system objects shown in the view if the user can’t select them?</p>
<p>Because there might be a file system object <i>inside</i> them.</p>
<p>The shell namespace has two attributes related to the file system. One is <code>SFGAO_</code><code>FILE­SYSTEM</code>, which means that the item is itself in the file system. The other is <code>SFGAO_</code><code>FILE­SYS­ANCESTOR</code> which means that the item <i>or its children</i> are in the file system.</p>
<p>If an item has the <code>SFGAO_</code><code>FILE­SYS­ANCESTOR</code> attribute, then it will show up in the “make sure the user picks an item in the file system” dialogs: Even if the item itself is not a file system item, it may <i>contain</i> a file system item, so the dialog shows the item so the user can navigate into it to find the actual file system item.</p>
<p>The <code>SFGAO_</code><code>FILE­SYS­ANCESTOR</code> attribute is like a sign that says “This way to the file system.”</p>
<p>If the file and folder picker dialogs showed only file system objects and not also file system ancestors, then your dialog would be pretty blank, seeing as the root items like <i>This PC</i> and <i>Network</i> are themselves not file system items. But if you want to pick something from your D: drive, you’ll probably need to go through <i>This PC</i> to get there.</p>
