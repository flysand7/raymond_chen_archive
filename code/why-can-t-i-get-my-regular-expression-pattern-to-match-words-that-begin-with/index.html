<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I get my regular expression pattern to match words that begin with %?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer asked for help writing a regular expression that, in the customer’s words, matched the string <code>%1</code> when it appeared as a standalone word.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Match</th>
<th>No match</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt><u>%1</u></tt></td>
<td><tt>%1b</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>:<u>%1</u>:</tt></td>
<td><tt>x%1</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> One of the things that people often forget to do when asking a question is to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/22/10000406.aspx"> describe the things that they tried and what the results were</a>. This is important information to include, because it saves the people who try to answer the question from wasting their time repeating the things that you already tried.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Pattern</th>
<th>String</th>
<th>Result</th>
<th>Expected</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>\b%1\b</tt></td>
<td><tt>%1</tt></td>
<td>No match</td>
<td>Match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>\b%1\b</tt></td>
<td><tt>:%1:</tt></td>
<td>No match</td>
<td>Match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>\b%1\b</tt></td>
<td><tt>x%1</tt></td>
<td>Match</td>
<td>No match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>^..$</tt></td>
<td><tt>%1</tt></td>
<td>Match</td>
<td>Match</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> That last entry was just to make sure that the test app was working, a valuable step when chasing a problem: First, make sure the problem is where you think it is. If the <tt>^..$</tt> hadn’t worked, then the problem would not have been with the regular expression but with some other part of the program.
 “Is the <tt>\b</tt> operator broken?”
 No, the <tt>\b</tt> operator is working just fine. The problem is that the <tt>\b</tt> operator doesn’t do what you think it does.
 For those not familiar with this notation, well, first you were probably confused by the <tt>\b</tt> in the original question and skipped the rest of this article. Anyway, <tt>\w</tt> matches A through Z (either uppercase or lowercase), a digit 0 through 9, or an underscore. (It’s actually more complicated than that, but the above description is good enough for the current discussion.) By contrast, <tt>\W</tt> matches every other character. And in regular expression speak, a “word” is a maximal contiguous string of <tt>\w</tt> characters. Finally, the <tt>\b</tt> operator matches the location between a <tt>\w</tt> and a <tt>\W</tt>, treating the beginning and end of the string as an invisible <tt>\W</tt>. I will stop mentioning the pretend <tt>\W</tt> at the ends of the string; just mentally insert them where applicable.
 Okay, let’s go back to the original regular expression of <tt>\b%1\b</tt>. Notice that the percent sign is not one of the things which is matched by <tt>\w</tt>. Therefore, in order for the <tt>\b</tt> that comes before it to match, the character before the percent sign must be a <tt>\W</tt>. That way, the <tt>\b</tt> comes between a <tt>\w</tt> and a <tt>\W</tt>. The pattern <tt>\b%1\b</tt> means “A percent sign which comes after a <tt>\w</tt>, followed by a 1 which comes before a <tt>\W</tt>.”
 Looking at it another way, the string <tt>%1</tt> breaks down like this:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td><tt>\W</tt></td>
<td>beginning of string (virtual)</td>
</tr>
<td><tt>\W</tt></td>
<td><tt>%</tt></td>
<td><tt>\w</tt></td>
<td><tt>1</tt></td>
<td><tt>\W</tt></td>
<td>end of string (virtual)</td>
</table>
<p> There is a <tt>\b</tt> between the <tt>%</tt> and the <tt>1</tt> and another one between the <tt>1</tt> and the end of the string, but there is no <tt>\b</tt> before the percent sign, because that location has <tt>\W</tt> on both sides.
 The question started off on the wrong foot: You are having trouble writing a regular expression that matches a word that begins with <tt>%</tt> because <i>there are no words which begin with <tt>%</tt></i>. The percent sign is not a <tt>\w</tt> and therefore cannot be part of a word.
 What the customer is looking for is something more like <tt>(?&lt;!\w)%1\b</tt>, a regular expression which means <i>a percent sign not preceded by a <tt>\w</tt>, followed by a 1 which comes before a <tt>\W</tt></i>.</p>
<p> The customer realized the mistake once it was pointed out. “I keep forgetting that I can’t get <tt>%</tt> included in <tt>\w</tt> just because I want it to.” </p>
