<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Injected class names: The C++ feature you didn’t even realize that you were using</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>C++ has a feature called <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/injected-class-name"> injected class names</a>, which lets you refer to the class being defined by its plain name without needing to fully qualify it with namespaces and template parameters.</p>
<p>You have probably been taking advantage of this feature without even realizing it:</p>
<pre>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct Wrapper
{
    Wrapper() { /* constructor */ }
};
</pre>
<p>That <code>Wrapper()</code> is using the injected class name. The full name of the constructor is</p>
<pre>    Wrapper&lt;T&gt;() { /* constructor */ }
</pre>
<p>but C++ secretly injects the simple name of the class into the class itself, as if you had written</p>
<pre>    using Wrapper = Wrapper&lt;T&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Injected class names are public and therefore can be inherited:</p>
<pre>namespace details {
    struct Base
    {
        Base(int) { /* constructor */ }
    };
}

struct Derived : details::Base
{
    Derived() : Base(42) { /* constructor */ }
};
</pre>
<p>The construction of the base class from the derived class can be done by writing just <code>Base(42)</code> instead of the full name <code>details::Base(42)</code>. The injection goes like this:</p>
<pre>namespace details {
    struct Base
    {
        <span style="color: blue;">using Base = ::details::Base; // injected</span>
        Base(int) { /* constructor */ }
    };
}

struct Derived : details::Base
{
    Derived() : Base(42) { /* constructor */ }
}
</pre>
<p>When you write <code>Base</code> inside the definition of <code>Derived</code>, you are using the name <code>Base</code> that was defined way over there in the <code>Base</code> class.</p>
<p>Note that making base classes private prevents their types from being inherited:</p>
<pre>namespace details {
    struct Base { };
    struct Middle : <span style="color: blue;">private</span> Base { };
}

struct Derived : details::Middle
{
    void blah()
    {
        Middle m; // "Middle" accessible from details::Middle
        Base b; // "Base" not accessible because it was privately inherited
        details::Base b; // Need to use the full name
    }
};
</pre>
