<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is std::exception_ptr nothrow constructible and assignable?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I was writing my <a href="/code/a-map-through-the-three-major-coroutine-series" title="A map through the three major coroutine series"> series on awaitable signals and coroutine promises</a>, I had to investigate a few details of the language specification, like <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210505-00/?p=105186"> why <code>coroutine_<wbr/>handle::<wbr/>resume()</code> is potentially-throwing</a>. Another detail I had to investigate was whether <code>std::<wbr/>exception_<wbr/>ptr</code> was potentially-throwing in its constructors and assignment operators.</p>
<p>The answer is <i>No</i>, but you have to chase through the language specification a bit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception_ptr"> <code>exception_ptr</code></a> is introduced in the C++ language specification under <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/propagation"> <b>[propagation]</b></a>, and it says that <code>exception_ptr</code> is a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/NullablePointer"> <i>NullablePointer</i></a>¹ but otherwise says nothing about exceptions.</p>
<p>Chase through to <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/nullablepointer.requirements"> <b>[nullablepointer.requirements]</b></a>, which spells out the various operations that must be supported. <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/NullablePointer"> It says</a>, for example, that the object must satisfy <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i> (or <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/CopyConstructible"><i>CopyConstructible</i></a>, as cppreference.com calls it), but if you follow that definition, there is still no mention of exceptions.</p>
<p>But the magic sentence is right there. You just overlooked it.</p>
<p>Back in the definition of <i>NullablePointer</i>, <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4659/nullablepointer.requirements#4"> it says</a>,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><span style="font-size: 66%;">4</span> No operation which is part of the <i>NullablePointer</i> requirements shall exit via an exception.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The <code>exception_ptr</code>, or more generally, anything that satisfies <i>NullablePointer</i>, is nothrow comparable, constructible, assignable, destructible, swappable, and testable.</p>
<p>¹ Starting in C++20, these requirements have been renamed <i>Cpp17NullablePointer</i>, <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i>, <i>etc</i>.</p>
