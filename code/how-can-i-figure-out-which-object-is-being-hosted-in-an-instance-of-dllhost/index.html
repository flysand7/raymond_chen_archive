<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I figure out which object is being hosted in an instance of dllhost?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We saw some time ago that the <code>dllhost.exe</code> process goes by the name <i>COM Surrogate</i> and is used <a href="/tips/what-does-the-com-surrogate-do-and-why-does-it-always-stop-working"> when a COM object is configured to run in a separate process</a>.</p>
<p>If you have found an instance of the <code>dllhost.exe</code> process, how can you figure out which COM object is running inside it? For example, maybe you are debugging an out-of-process COM object and you want to find the <code>dllhost.exe</code> that is hosting it, so you can debug further. Or you’re studying a crash of <code>dllhost.exe</code> and you want to know what object the crashed <code>dllhost.exe</code> was working with.</p>
<p>Note that this information is for debugging purposes only.</p>
<p>The information is encoded in the <code>dllhost.exe</code> command line. From the debugger, you can use the <code>!peb</code> command to view the command line. You can also ask Task Manager to show the command line by going to the <i>Details</i> page and turning on the <i>Command line</i> column.</p>
<p>From the command line, extract the GUID. That is the AppId of the object loaded into the <code>dllhost.exe</code> process. You can look up this GUID in the registry under <code>HKEY_<wbr/>CLASSES_<wbr/>ROOT\<wbr/>AppId\<wbr/>{Guid}</code>. That will give you some information about what the object is. To obtain the CLSID that corresponds to the AppId, go to <code>HKEY_<wbr/>CLASSES_<wbr/>ROOT\<wbr/>CLSID</code> and search for the AppId GUID. It will be a value inside one of the CLSID entries. That’s the object.</p>
