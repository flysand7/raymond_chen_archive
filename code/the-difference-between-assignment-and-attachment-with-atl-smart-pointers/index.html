<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The difference between assignment and attachment with ATL smart pointers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Last time,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/19/9924950.aspx">
I presented a puzzle regarding a memory leak</a>.
Here’s the relevant code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
<font color="red">CComPtr&lt;IStream&gt; pMemoryStream;</font>
CComPtr&lt;IXmlReader&gt; pReader;
UINT nDepth = 0;
//Open read-only input stream
<font color="red">pMemoryStream = ::SHCreateMemStream(utf8Xml, cbUtf8Xml);</font>
</pre>
<p>
The problem here is assigning the return value of
<code>SHCreateMemStream</code> to a smart pointer
instead of attaching it.
</p>
<p>
The <code>SHCreateMemStream</code> function creates a memory stream
and returns a pointer to it.
That pointer has a reference count of one,
in accordance with COM rules that a function
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms692481.aspx">
which produces a reference calls <code>AddRef</code>,
and the responsibility is placed upon the recipient
to call <code>Release</code></a>.
The assignment operator for <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is a copy operation:
It <code>AddRef</code>s the pointer and saves it.
You’re still on the hook for the reference count of the original pointer.
</p>
<pre>
ATLINLINE ATLAPI_(IUnknown*) AtlComPtrAssign(IUnknown** pp, IUnknown* lp)
{
        if (lp != NULL)
                lp-&gt;AddRef();
        if (*pp)
                (*pp)-&gt;Release();
        *pp = lp;
        return lp;
}
template &lt;class T&gt;
class CComPtr
{
public:
        ...
        T* operator=(T* lp)
        {
                return (T*)AtlComPtrAssign((IUnknown**)&amp;p, lp);
        }
</pre>
<p>
Observe that assigning a <code>T*</code> to a <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/06/108395.aspx">
<code>AddRef</code>s the incoming pointer</a>
and
<code>Release</code>s the old pointer (if any).
When the <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is destructed, it will release
the pointer, undoing the <code>AddRef</code> that was performed by
the assignment operator.
In other words, assignment followed by destruction has a net effect
of zero on the pointer you assigned.
The operation behaves like a copy.
</p>
<p>
Another way of putting a pointer into a <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>
is with the <code>Attach</code> operator.
This is a transfer operation:
</p>
<pre>
        void Attach(T* p2)
        {
                if (p)
                        p-&gt;Release();
                p = p2;
        }
</pre>
<p>
Observe that there is no <code>AddRef</code> here.
When the <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> is destructed,
it will perform the <code>Release</code>,
which doesn’t undo any operation performed by the <code>Attach</code>.
Instead, it releases the reference count held by the original pointer
you attached.
</p>
<p>
Let’s put this in a table, since people seem to like tables:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
<th>Semantics</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attach()</td>
<td>Takes ownership</td>
<td>Transfer semantics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>operator=()</td>
<td>Creates a new reference</td>
<td>Copy semantics</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
You use the <code>Attach</code> method when you want to assume
responsibility for releasing the pointer (ownership transfer).
You use the assignment operator when you want the original pointer
to continue to be responsible for its own release (no ownership transfer).
</p>
<p>
There is also a <code>Detach</code> method which is the opposite of
<code>Attach</code>:
Detaching a pointer from the <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code>
means “I am taking over responsibility for releasing this pointer.”
The <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> gives you its pointer and then forgets
about it; you’re now on your own.
</p>
<p>
The memory leak in the code fragment above occurs because the
assignment operator has copy semantics, but we wanted transfer
semantics,
since we want the smart pointer to take the responsibility for
releasing the pointer when it is destructed.
</p>
<pre>
pMemoryStream.Attach(::SHCreateMemStream(utf8Xml, cbUtf8Xml));
</pre>
<p>
The <code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;::operator=(T*)</code> method
is definitely one of the more dangerous methods in the
<code>CComPtr&lt;T&gt;</code> repertoire,
because it’s so easy to assign a pointer to a smart pointer
without giving it a moment’s thought.
(Another dangerous method is the
<code>T** CComPtr&lt;T&gt;::operator&amp;()</code>,
but at least that has an assertion to try to catch the bad usages.
Even nastier is
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2009/11/04/type-safety-issue-when-assigning-ccomptr-t-instances.aspx">
the secret QI’ing assignment operator</a>.)
I have to say that there is merit to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/06/108395.aspx#108407">
Ben Hutchings’ recommendation</a> simply not to allow a simple pointer
to be assigned to a smart pointer, precisely because the semantics are
easily misunderstood.
(The boost library, for example, follows Ben’s recommendation.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s another exercise based on what you’ve learned:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
Application Verifier told us that we have a memory leak,
and we traced it back to the
function <code>GetTextAsInteger</code>.
</p>
<pre>
BSTR GetInnerText(IXMLDOMNode *node)
{
    BSTR bstrText = NULL;
    node-&gt;get_text(&amp;bstrText);
    return bstrText;
}
DWORD GetTextAsInteger(IXMLDOMNode *node)
{
    DWORD value = 0;
    CComVariant innerText = GetInnerText(node);
    hr = VariantChangeType(&amp;innerText, &amp;innerText, 0, VT_UI4);
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        value = V_UI4(&amp;innerText);
    }
    return value;
}
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, the problem is that we passed the same input and output
pointers to <code>VariantChangeType</code>,
causing the output integer to overwrite the input <code>BSTR</code>,
resulting in the leak of the <code>BSTR</code>.
But when we fixed the function, we still got the leak:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD GetTextAsInteger(IXMLDOMNode *node)
{
    DWORD value = 0;
    CComVariant innerText = GetInnerText(node);
    <font color="blue">CComVariant textAsValue;</font>
    hr = VariantChangeType(&amp;innerText, &amp;<font color="blue">textAsValue</font>, 0, VT_UI4);
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        value = V_UI4(&amp;<font color="blue">textAsValue</font>);
    }
    return value;
}
</pre>
<p>
Is there a leak in the <code>VariantChangeType</code> function itself?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hint: It is in fact explicitly documented that the output parameter
to <code>VariantChangeType</code> can be equal to the input parameter,
which results in an in-place conversion.
There was nothing wrong with the original call to
<code>VariantChangeType</code>.</p>
