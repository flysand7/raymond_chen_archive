<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Rescuing thread messages from modal loops via message filters</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
As we have seen recently, thread messages are eaten by modal loops
because they have nowhere to go when dispatched.
However, there is a way to see them before they vanish,
provided the modal loop is cooperative.
</p>
<p>
The WH_MSGFILTER message hook allows you to receive messages
passed to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/hooks/hookreference/hookfunctions/callmsgfilter.asp">
the <code>CallMsgFilter</code> function</a>.
Fortunately, all the modal loops in the window manager use
<code>CallMsgFilter</code> to allow the thread to capture thread
messages before they are lost.
Therefore, this gives you a way to snoop
on messages as they travel through modal loops.
</p>
<p>
Let’s add a message filter to the program we wrote last time to
see how messages pass through a message filter.
Note that <strong>this is the wrong way to solve the problem</strong>.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/27/412565.aspx">
The correct solution was illustrated last time</a>.
I’m doing it the wrong way
to illustrate message filters since they are not
well-understood.  (For example, a valid reason for a message
filter would to
prevent the menu loop from seeing certain input.)
</p>
<p>
Start with the program from last the before we changed the
<code>PostThreadMessage</code> to a <code>PostMessage</code>,
then make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">HHOOK g_hhkMSGF;
LRESULT CALLBACK MsgFilterProc(int code, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 MSG* pmsg = (MSG*)lParam;
 if (code &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; IsThreadMessage(pmsg)) return TRUE;
 return CallNextHookEx(g_hhkMSGF, code, wParam, lParam);
}</font>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
<font color="blue"> g_hhkMSGF = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_MSGFILTER, MsgFilterProc,
    NULL, GetCurrentThreadId());
 if (!g_hhkMSGF) return FALSE;</font>
 DWORD dwThread;
 HANDLE hThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, ThreadProc,
       UintToPtr(GetCurrentThreadId()), 0, &amp;dwThread);
 ...
</pre>
<p>
Here, we installed a message filter hook on our thread so that we can seem
messages as they pass through modal loops.  The <code>code</code>
parameter tells us what type of modal loop retrieved the message;
we ignore it here since we want to do our filtering for all modal loops.
</p>
<p>
Run this program and observe that the beeps are no longer lost
because our message filter is getting a chance to see them and
react to them.
</p>
<p>
The message filter trick relies on all modal loops sending the
messages they retrieve through a message filter before dispatching
them.  If you are writing code that is going into a library,
and you have a modal loop, then you too should call the message filter
before dispatching messages you’ve retrieved, in case the program
using your library wants to do something with the message.
</p>
<pre>
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
 <font color="blue">if (!CallMsgFilter(&amp;msg, MSGF_MYLIBRARY)) {</font>
  TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
  DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
 <font color="blue">}</font>
}
</pre>
<p>
The value <code>MSGF_MYLIBRARY</code> is an arbitrary positive value
you can choose and document in your library’s header file.
You can see examples of this in the <code>commctrl.h</code> header
file:
</p>
<pre>
#define MSGF_COMMCTRL_BEGINDRAG     0x4200
#define MSGF_COMMCTRL_SIZEHEADER    0x4201
#define MSGF_COMMCTRL_DRAGSELECT    0x4202
#define MSGF_COMMCTRL_TOOLBARCUST   0x4203
</pre>
<p>
These are the message filters called by the modal loops in the
shell common controls library.
</p>
<p>
One question you might ask is, “Why use a message filter hook
instead of a <code>GetMessage</code> hook?”
</p>
<p>
Message filter hooks are less expensive than <code>GetMessage</code>
hooks because they are called only upon request, as opposed to
a <code>GetMessage</code> hook
which is called for every retrieved message.
Message filter hooks also tell you <strong>which</strong> modal loop
is doing the filtering, in case you want to adjust your behavior
accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The downside of message filter hooks is that all modal loops need
to remember to call <code>CallMsgFilter</code> as part of their
dispatch loop.</p>
