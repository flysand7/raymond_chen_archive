<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The lackey catastrophe</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We encountered a real problem with global object destruction in Explorer. The object in question was an RAII container for a graphics object, so its destructor destroyed the graphics object. But the call to destroy the object was crashing. </p>

<p>What’s going on? </p>
<p>The call to <code>Delete­Object</code> was occurring after <code>GDI32</code> had already run its <strike><code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code></strike> <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>. As a result, it was calling into a DLL that had already uninitialized, so bad things happen. </p>
<p>But wait, how can you call into a DLL that has already uninitialized? The EXE links to the DLL via a load-time dependency, so the EXE should uninitialize first. But it’s not. Why not? </p>
<p>Recall <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141017-00/?p=43823">how global objects are constructed and destructed</a>. If the global object had been in a DLL, then indeed the loader dependency analysis would have seen that the global object’s DLL depends upon <code>GDI32</code>. </p>
<p>As we saw in the earlier discussion, executables do not have <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>. You can look at the situation in two ways: One interpretation is that the executable has already stopped running at the point it calls <code>Exit­Process</code>. All that’s left is to shut down the DLLs. Another interpretation is that the executable is <i>always</i> running (seeing as DLLs run in the context of a process), so there’s no point trying to wait until the executable has “finished” because if you did that, you’d be waiting forever. </p>
<p>Anyway, regardless of how you choose to look at the situation, the problem is the same: The lackey we hired to run down our global objects is running them down too late. </p>
<p>This is a case where the C runtime is doing the best it possibly can, but it’s still not good enough. </p>
<p>Next time, we’ll look at one possible extrication from this quandary. </p>
