<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Determining whether your window is covered</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
        The method described in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/29/54728.aspx">the
        previous coding blog entry</a> works great if you are using the window visibility state
        to control painting, since you’re using the paint system itself to do the heavy lifting
        for you.
    </p>
<p>
        To obtain this information outside of the paint loop, use <code>GetDC</code> and <code>GetClipBox</code>.
        The HDC that comes out of <code>GetDC</code> is clipped to the visible region, and
        then you can use <code>GetClipBox</code> to extract information out of it.
    </p>
<p>
        Start with our scratch program and add these lines:
    </p>
<pre>void CALLBACK
PollTimer(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, UINT_PTR idTimer, DWORD dwTime)
{
    HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
    if (hdc) {
        RECT rcClip, rcClient;
        LPCTSTR pszMsg;
        switch (GetClipBox(hdc, &amp;rcClip)) {
        case NULLREGION:
            pszMsg = TEXT("completely covered"); break;
        case SIMPLEREGION:
            GetClientRect(hwnd, &amp;rcClient);
            if (EqualRect(&amp;rcClient, &amp;rcClip)) {
                pszMsg = TEXT("completely uncovered");
            } else {
                pszMsg = TEXT("partially covered");
            }
            break;
        case COMPLEXREGION:
            pszMsg = TEXT("partially covered"); break;
        default:
            pszMsg = TEXT("Error"); break;
        }
        // If we wanted, we could also use RectVisible
        // or PtVisible - or go totally overboard by
        // using GetClipRgn
        ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc);
        SetWindowText(hwnd, pszMsg);
    }
}
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
    SetTimer(hwnd, 1, 1000, PollTimer);
    return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
        Once a second, the window title will update with the current visibility of the client
        rectangle.
    </p>
<p>
        Polling is more expensive than letting the paint system do the work for you, so do
        try to use the painting method first.
    </p>

        (Side note: The reason why part 9 of the scrollbar series is so slow to come out finally
        struck me as I tried to write it: It’s too big. I’ve split it into parts 9 through
        12, with an optional part 13; that may make the little pieces more manageable. Part
        9 is written, but I want to hold off posting it until I’ve got at least through part
        12, because something from the later parts may force me to rewrite part
        9.  A somewhat self-absorbed and rather boring insight into the writing process.)
