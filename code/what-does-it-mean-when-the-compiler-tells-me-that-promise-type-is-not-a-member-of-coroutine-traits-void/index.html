<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does it mean when the compiler tells me that <code>promise_type</code>: is not a member of <code>coroutine_traits&lt;void&gt;</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer using C++/WinRT found that their attempt to perform a <code>co_await</code> on an <code>IAsyncAction</code> failed to compile with the error</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">promise_type: is not a member of coroutine_traits&lt;void&gt;
</pre>
<p>What does this error mean? “We included <code>&lt;winrt/Windows.Foundation.h&gt;</code>, which is allegedly <a href="/code/why-am-i-getting-a-weird-error-about-promise-type-when-i-try-to-write-a-coroutine" title="Why am I getting a weird error about promise_type when I try to write a coroutine?"> how to fix this weird error message</a>, but that didn’t fix it.”</p>
<p>This is a case of skipping the <i>reading the explanation</i> part of looking for a solution to your problem and skipping directly to the <i>how to fix it</i> part, without checking that the <i>how to fix it</i> applies to your specific situation. “Somebody called in to a car repair show because their car didn’t start, and the answer was that they had loose battery cables. My car won’t start, and I tightened the battery cables, but it didn’t fix it.” Well yeah, because you skipped over the part of the call where they did the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>As I noted in the earlier article, the <code>co_await</code> keyword triggers the coroutine transformation which rewrites the function performing the <code>co_await</code> into a state machine, and one of the pieces of the state machine is the <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code> associated with the coroutine’s return type and parameters.</p>
<p>The <code>coroutine_<wbr/>traits</code> specialization in the error message is <code>coroutine_traits&lt;void&gt;</code>, so the return type is <code>void</code> and there are no parameters. In other words, the function performing the <code>co_await</code> looks something like this:</p>
<pre>void DoSomething()
{
    co_await MyFunctionAsync();
}
</pre>
<p>The C++/WinRT library provides support for producing coroutines returning <code>winrt::<wbr/>Windows::Foundation::<wbr/>IAsyncAction</code> and related interfaces, as well as the special type <code>winrt::<wbr/>fire_<wbr/>and_<wbr/>forget</code>. It does not, however, add support for coroutines returning <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>winrt/<wbr/>Windows.<wbr/>Foundation.<wbr/>h</code> header file defines the Windows Runtime coroutines, but <code>void</code> is not a Windows Runtime coroutine type, so including Windows Runtime headers isn’t going to help. The code probably meant for <code>Do­Something()</code> to return a type that can be used for coroutines, most likely <code>IAsyncAction</code> or <code>fire_<wbr/>and_<wbr/>forget</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you could always write your own support for producing coroutines returning <code>void</code>, say, by having it behave roughly the same as <code>fire_<wbr/>and_<wbr/>forget</code>. It’s not hard.</p>
<p>But probably not advisable.</p>
