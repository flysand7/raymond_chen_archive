<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are leading digits converted to language-specific digit shapes, but not trailing digits, and how do I suppress the conversion entirely?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you have a string like <code>12345ABCDE67890</code>, and you render it on an Arabic system, you might get <span dir="ltr">٠١٢٣٤ABCDE67890</span>. The leading digits are rendered as Arabic-Indic digits, but the trailing digits are rendered as European digits. What’s going on here?
 This is a feature known as <i>contextual digit substitution</i>. You can specify whether European digits are replaced with native equivalents by going to the <i>Region</i> control panel (formerly known as <i>Regional and Language Options</i>), clicking on the <i>Formats</i> tab, going to <i>Additional settings</i> (formerly known as <i>Customize this format</i>), and looking at the options under <i>Use native digits</i>. The three options there correspond to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120119031036/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/09/09/462920.aspx"> the three values for <code>LOCAL_IDIGITSUBSTITUTION</code></a>.
 Programmatically, you can override the user preference (if you know that you are in a special case, like an IP address) by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317791%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"> following the instructions in MSDN</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p> As a last resort, you can stick a Unicode NODS (U+206F) at the beginning of the string to force European digits, or a <!-- A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2011/05/12/10163685.aspx" --> Unicode NADS (U+206E) to force national digits.
 <b>Bonus chatter</b>: What’s the point of contextual digit substitution anyway?
 Suppose you have the string “there are 3 items remaining.” (Let’s say that all text in lowercase is in Arabic.) You want this 3 to be rendered in Arabic-Indic digits because it is part of an Arabic sentence. On the other hand, if you have the string “that’s a really nice BMW 350.” you want the 350 to be in European digits since it is part of the brand name “BMW 350”.</p>
<p> Contextual digit substitution chooses whether to use Arabic-Indic digits or European digits by matching them to the characters that immediately precede them. (And if no character precedes them, then it uses the ambient language.) </p>
