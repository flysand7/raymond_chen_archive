<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Do you need clean up one-shot timers?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/createtimerqueuetimer.asp">
The <code>CreateTimerQueueTimer</code> function</a> allows you to create
one-shot timers by passing
the <code>WT_EXECUTEONLYONCE</code> flag.
The documentation says that
you need to call
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/deletetimerqueuetimer.asp">
the <code>DeleteTimerQueueTimer</code> function</a>
when you no longer need the timer.
</p>
<p>
Why do you need to clean up one-shot timers?
</p>
<p>
To answer this, I would like to introduce you to one of my
favorite rhetorical questions when trying to puzzle out
API design:
“What would the world be like if this were true?”
</p>
<p>
Imagine what the world would be like if you didn’t need to
clean up one-shot timers.
</p>
<p>
Well, for one thing, it means that the behavior of the
function would be confusing.  The caller of the
the <code>CreateTimerQueueTimer</code> function would have
to keep track of whether the timer was one-shot or not,
to know whether or not the handle needed to be deleted.
</p>
<p>
But far, far worse is that if one-shot timers were self-deleting,
it would be impossible to use them correctly.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you have an object that creates a one-shot timer,
and you want to clean it up in your destructor if it hasn’t fired yet.
If one-shot timers were self-deleting,
then it would be impossible to write this object.
</p>
<pre>
class Sample {
 HANDLE m_hTimer;
 Sample() : m_hTimer(NULL) { CreateTimerQueueTimer(&amp;m_hTimer, …); }
 ~Sample() { … what to write here? … }
};
</pre>
<p>
You might say, “Well, I’ll have my callback null out the
<code>m_hTimer</code> variable. That way, the destructor
will know that the timer has fired.”
</p>
<p>
Except that’s a race condition.
</p>
<pre>
Sample::Callback(void *context)
{
  /// RACE WINDOW HERE
  ((Sample*)context)-&gt;m_hTimer = NULL;
  …
}
</pre>
<p>
If the callback is pre-empted during the race window
and the object is destructed,
and one-shot timers were self-deleting,
then the object would attempt to use an invalid handle.
</p>
<p>
This race window is uncloseable
since the race happens even before
you get a chance to execute a single line of code.
</p>
<p>
So be glad that you have to delete handles to one-shot timers.
</p></p>
