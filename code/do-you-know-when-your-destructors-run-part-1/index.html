<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/LarryOsterman/archive/2004/04/22/118240.aspx">
Larry Osterman discussed the importance of knowing when your
global destructors run</a>, but this problem is not exclusive
to global objects.  You need to take care even with local
objects.  Consider:
</p>
<pre>
void Sample()
{
  if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {
    CComPtr&lt;IXMLDOMDocument&gt; p;
    if (SUCCEEDED(p.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_IXMLDOMDocument))) {
     ...
    }
    CoUninitialize();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Easy as pie.  And there’s a bug here.
</p>
<p>
When does the destructor for that smart-pointer run?
</p>
<p>
Answer: When the object goes out of scope,
which is at the closing brace of the outer <code>if</code> statement,
<strong>after</strong> the <code>CoUninitialize</code> call.
</p>
<p>
So you shut down COM, and then try to access a pointer to a COM object.
This is not good.
(Or as Larry describes it, “Blam!”)
</p>
<p>
To fix this problem, you have to release all your COM pointers
before the <code>CoUninitialize</code>.  One way would be to insert a
<code>p.Release()</code> at the end of the inner <code>if</code>.
(But of course, if you’re going to do that, then why bother using
a smart pointer?)
</p>
<p>
Another fix would be to introduce a seemingly unnecessary scope:
</p>
<pre>
void Sample()
{
  if (SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {
    {
      CComPtr&lt;IXMLDOMDocument&gt; p;
      if (SUCCEEDED(p.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_IXMLDOMDocument))) {
       ...
      }
    } <font color="blue">// ensure p is destructed before the CoUninit</font>
    CoUninitialize();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Make sure you leave that comment there or the next person to come
across this code is going to “clean it up” by removing the
“redundant” braces.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this is still too subtle.  Here’s another solution:
Put the CoUninitialize inside a destructor of its own!
</p>
<pre>
class CCoInitialize {
public:
 CCoInitialize() : m_hr(CoInitialize(NULL)) { }
 ~CCoInitialize() { if (SUCCEEDED(m_hr)) CoUninitialize(); }
 operator HRESULT() const { return m_hr; }
 HRESULT m_hr;
};
void Sample()
{
  CCoInitialize init;
  if (SUCCEEDED(init)) {
    CComPtr&lt;IXMLDOMDocument&gt; p;
    if (SUCCEEDED(p.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_IXMLDOMDocument))) {
     ...
    }
  }
} <font color="blue">// CoUninitialize happens here</font>
</pre>
<p>
This works even if you put the smart pointer at the same scope,
as long as you put it <strong>after the CCoInitialize object</strong>:</p>
<pre>
void Sample()
{
  CCoInitialize init;
  CComPtr&lt;IXMLDOMDocument&gt; p;
  if (SUCCEEDED(init) &amp;&amp;
      SUCCEEDED(p.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_IXMLDOMDocument))) {
   ...
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
This works because objects with automatic storage duration
are destructed in reverse order of declaration, so the
object <code>p</code> wil be destructed first, then the
object <code>init</code>.
</p>
<p>
Mind you, this is basically subtle no matter now you slice it.
Nobody said programming was easy.
