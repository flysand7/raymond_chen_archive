<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the CompileAsWinRT Visual Studio project option mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was investigating some build problems in their C++/WinRT project related to mismatches in the state of <code>WINRT_<wbr/>NO_<wbr/>MAKE_<wbr/>DETECTION</code>. Along the way, they found that in their project file, they did not set <code>CompileAsWinRT</code> to <code>true</code>. Is that a problem?</p>
<p>The <code>CompileAsWinRT</code> property controls whether the Microsoft C++ compiler enables C++/CX language extensions. It corresponds to the command line switch <code>/ZW</code>. This is confirmed by the <code>cl.xml</code> file buried deep inside Visual Studio:</p>
<pre>  &lt;BoolProperty
        Name="CompileAsWinRT"
        DisplayName="Consume Windows Runtime Extension"
        Description="Consume the Windows Run Time languages extensions.  (/ZW)"
        Category="General"
        Switch="ZW"
        F1Keyword="VC.Project.VCCLCompilerTool.CompileAsWinRT"&gt;
  &lt;/BoolProperty&gt;
</pre>
<p>(I like how they spelled it as <i>Run Time</i> in the description, but used the compound word <i>Runtime</i> in the display name.)</p>
<p>C++/CX was the first projection of the Windows Runtime into C++, so it got first dibs and took the good name. It’s now a decade later, and C++/CX is no longer the Windows Runtime projection of choice, but the name of the property can’t be changed for compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>So don’t worry, you don’t need to (and indeed shouldn’t) turn on <code>CompileAsWinRT</code> for your C++/WinRT projects. Turning it on enables the old-and-busted projection of the Windows Runtime.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: So what’s the compiler switch to enable C++/WinRT?</p>
<p>That’s a trick question. There is no special compiler switch needed because C++/WinRT is written in standard C++. No nonstandard language extensions are required. Just include the C++/WinRT header files and go.</p>
