<p>
One customer traced a problem they were having to the way they
were calling a function similar in spirit to this one:
</p>
<pre>
HGLOBAL CopyClipboardData(UINT cf)
{
 HGLOBAL hglob = NULL;
 HANDLE h = GetClipboardData(cf);
 if (h) {
  void *p = GlobalLock(h);
  if (p) {
   SIZE_T size = GlobalSize(h);
   hglob = GlobalAlloc(GMEM_FIXED, size);
   if (hglob) {
    CopyMemory(hglob, p, size);
   }
   GlobalUnlock(h);
  }
 }
 return hglob;
}
</pre>
<p>
This function takes a clipboard format and
looks for it on the clipboard.
If found, it returns a copy of the data.
</p>
<p>
Looks great, huh?
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the customer would sometimes call the function as
<code>CopyClipboardData(CF_BITMAP)</code>.
The <code>CF_BITMAP</code> clipboard format stores its contents in
the form of a <code>HBITMAP</code>,
not an <code>HGLOBAL</code>.
</p>
<p>
The question from the customer:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
This code was written in 2002, and we are wondering why it works
“most” of the time and crashes sporadically.
We expected that the call to <code>GlobalLock</code> would fail
with an invalid parameter error, but sometimes it succeeds,
and then when we call
<code>GlobalSize</code> we crash.
Why does it crash sometimes?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You already know the answer to this.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/09/254441.aspx">
<code>GlobalAlloc</code> works closely with
<code>GlobalLock</code> so that <code>GlobalLock</code> can be fast</a>.
The bitmap handle returned by <code>GetClipboardData</code>
usually fails the quick tests performed by <code>GlobalLock</code>
to see whether the parameter is a fixed memory block,
in which case the <code>GlobalLock</code> must go down its slow code path,
and it is in this slow code path that the function recognizes that the
the handle is downright invalid.
</p>
<p>
But once in a rare while, the bitmap handle happens to smell just
enough like a fixed global handle that it passes the tests,
and <code>GlobalLock</code> uses its highly optimized code path
where it says,
“Okay, this is one of those fixed global handles that
<code>GlobalAlloc</code> created for me.
I can just return the pointer back.”
Result:
The call to <code>GlobalLock</code> succeeds
(garbage in, garbage out),
and then you crash in the <code>GlobalSize</code> function
where it tries to use the <code>HBITMAP</code> as if it were
a <code>HGLOBAL</code> and access some of the memory block metadata,
which isn’t there since the handle isn’t valid after all.
</p>
<p>
The bitmap handle is basically a random number from the global
heap’s point of view, since it’s just some number that some other
component made up.
It’s not a global handle.
If you generate enough random numbers,
eventually one of them will look like a valid parameter.</p>
