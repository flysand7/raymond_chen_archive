<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I move an HTREEITEM to a new parent?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Suppose you have a TreeView control, and you created an item in it, and you want to move the <code>HTREEITEM</code> to a new parent. How do you do that?</p>
<p> You can’t, at least not all in one motion. </p>
<p> You will have to delete the <code>HTREEITEM</code> and then re-create it in its new location. </p>
<p> If you want to move an <code>HTREEITEM</code> within the same parent (say, to reorder it among its siblings), then you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773785.aspx"> <code>Tree­View_Sort­Children­CB</code></a> and pass a custom sort function that rearranges the children into the order you want. </p>
