<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A survey of the various ways of creating GDI bitmaps with predefined data</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Suppose you have a buffer full of pixels and you want to create a GDI bitmap that contains those pixels. </p>
<p>We’ll start with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd183485(v=vs.85).aspx"><code>Create­Bitmap</code> function</a>. This creates a device-dependent bitmap with the pixels you provide. The weird thing about this function is that it’s a device-dependent bitmap, but there’s no parameter that specifies the device! As a result, the bitmap has the format you specify, but you can select it only into device contexts that are compatible with the bitmap format. For example, if you create a 4bpp bitmap, then you can select it only into 4bpp device contexts.¹ </p>
<p>Next up is the misleadingly-named <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd183491(v=vs.85).aspx"><code>Create­DI­Bitmap</code> function</a>. Even though the <i>DI</i> stands for device independent, this function does not create a device-independent bitmap. It creates a device-dependent bitmap that is compatible with the provided device context. The reason it’s called <i>DI</i> is that you can provide pixels in a device-independent format, and those pixels will be used to initialize the bitmap. As noted in the documentation, the behavior is functionally equivalent to <code>Create­Compatible­Bitmap</code> followed by <code>Set­DI­Bits</code>. </p>
<p>If it’s a device-independent bitmap you want, then the function to use is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd183494(v=vs.85).aspx"><code>Create­DIB­Section</code></a>. The simplest use of this function creates a device-independent bitmap and gives you a pointer to the in-memory pixel buffer. You can then manipulate the pixel buffer directly, say, by <code>memcpy</code>ing the bytes from your original buffer. </p>
<p>The fancier use of this function creates a device-independent bitmap <i>around existing memory</i>. The memory needs to be in a file mapping object, either a file mapping object created from a file or (more often) a file mapping object created from the page file (in other words, a shared memory block). You can then specify the byte offset within the file mapping at which the pixel buffer starts. In this case, the memory is not copied; the memory in the file mapping object is the backing memory for the bitmap. If you modify the bitmap, then the contents of the file mapping object change; if you modify the contents of the file mapping object, you modify the bitmap. </p>
<p>Here’s the table: </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Type of bitmap</th>
<th>Resulting format</th>
<th>Source pixels</th>
<th>Must format match?</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Create­Bitmap</code></td>
<td>Device-dependent</td>
<td>As specified</td>
<td>Copied</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Create­DI­Bitmap</code></td>
<td>Device-dependent</td>
<td>Device-compatible</td>
<td>Copied</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Create­DIB­Section</code> without <code>hSection</code></td>
<td>Device-independent</td>
<td>As specified</td>
<td>Uninitialized (copy them yourself)</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Create­DIB­Section</code> with <code>hSection</code></td>
<td>Device-independent</td>
<td>As specified</td>
<td>Shared</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In the above table, the <i>Resulting format</i> column describes the pixel format of the returned bitmap. The <i>Source pixels</i> column describes what happens to the pixels you pass as the source pixels: Are they copied into the bitmap, or does the bitmap share the memory with the source pixels? The <i>Must format match?</i> column specifies whether the format of the source pixels must match the pixel format of the returned bitmap. If <i>Must format match?</i> is <i>No</i>, then the system will perform a format conversion. </p>
<p>¹ Monochrome bitmaps are compatible with any device context and have <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061114-01/?p=29013">special behavior when selected into color device contexts</a>.</p>
