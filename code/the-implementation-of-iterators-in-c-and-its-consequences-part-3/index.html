<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The implementation of iterators in C# and its consequences (part 3)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
I mentioned that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849519.aspx">
there was an exception</a>
to the general statement that the conversion of an iterator into
traditional C# code is something you could have done yourself.
That’s true, and it was also a pun,
because the exception is exception handling.
</p>
<p>
If you have a <code>try … finally</code> block in your iterator,
the language executes the <code>finally</code> block under the following
conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>After the last statement of the <code>try</code> block is executed.
    (No surprise here.)
<li>When an exception propagates out of the <code>try</code> block.
    (No surprise here either.)
<li>When execution leaves the <code>try</code> block via
    <code>yield break</code>.
<li>When the iterator is <code>Dispose</code>d and the iterator body
    was trapped inside a <code>try</code> block at the time.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
That last case can occur if somebody decides to abandon the enumerator
before it is finished.
</p>
<pre>
IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountTo10()
{
 try {
  for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
   yield return i;
  }
 } finally {
  System.Console.WriteLine(“finally”);
 }
}</pre></p>
<p>foreach (int i in CountTo10()) {
 System.Console.WriteLine(i);
 if (i == 5) break;
}

<p>
This code fragment prints “1 2 3 4 5 finally”.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, this behavior is completely natural.
You want the <code>finally</code> block to execute when
the <code>try</code> block is finished executing, either by normal
or abnormal means.
Although control leaves the <code>try</code> block
during the <code>yield return</code>, it comes back when
the caller asks for the next item from the enumerator, so execution
of the <code>try</code> block isn’t finished yet.
The <code>try</code> is finished executing after the last statement
completes,
an exception is thrown past it,
or execution is abandoned when the enumerator is prematurely destroyed.
</p>
<p>
And this is exactly what you want when you use the <code>finally</code>
block to clean up resources used by the <code>try</code> block.
</p>
<p>
Now, technically, you <i>can</i> write this yourself without
using iterators, but it’s pretty ugly.
You’ll need more internal state variables to keep track of whether
the <code>try</code> block is still active and whether the exit
of the <code>try</code> block is temporary (due to <code>yield return</code>)
or permanent.
It’s a real pain in the neck, however, so you probably are better off
letting the compiler do the work for you.
