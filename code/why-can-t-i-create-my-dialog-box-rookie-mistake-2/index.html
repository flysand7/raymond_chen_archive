<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I create my dialog box? Rookie mistake #2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Another class of rookie mistake is less obvious from looking
at the code.
</p>
<pre>
#define DLG_SAMPLE 1
DLG_SAMPLE DIALOGEX 32, 32, 210, 200
...
BEGIN
 ...
 CONTROL "",IDC_LISTVIEW,WC_LISTVIEW,LVS_REPORT |
         WS_TABSTOP | WS_BORDER,
         14,92,182, 80
 ...
END
DialogBox(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(DLG_SAMPLE),
          hwnd, SampleDlgProc);
</pre>
<p>
The problem with this code is that we forgot to call
<code>InitCommonControlsEx</code> to register the listview class.
More generally, the problem is that one of the controls on the
dialog uses a window class that was not registered.
(For example, maybe there’s a rich edit control on the dialog,
but nobody remembered to load the rich edit library.)
</p>
<p>
Next time, a sophomore version of this mistake.</p>
