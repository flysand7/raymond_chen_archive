<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The great thing about regular expression languages is that there are so many to choose from!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Before you ask a question about regular expressions,
you should make sure you and your audience agree on
<i>which</i> regular expression language you are talking about.
</p>
<p>
Here is a
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130830063653/http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html">
handy table of which features are supported by
which regular expression language</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can use that table to solve this customer’s problem:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I have a regular expression that works just fine when I test
it in
⟨<i>insert regular expression testing tool, like
<a href="http://gskinner.com/RegExr/">RegExr</a>
or
<a href="http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/java/index.html">
RegexPlanet</a></i>⟩,
but I can’t get it to work in real life.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; findstr /r /c:"a(?!.*b)" file.txt
<i>(prints no results!)</i>
C:\&gt;
</pre>
<p>
My goal is to find all lines that contain an <code>a</code>
not followed anywhere by a <code>b</code>.
