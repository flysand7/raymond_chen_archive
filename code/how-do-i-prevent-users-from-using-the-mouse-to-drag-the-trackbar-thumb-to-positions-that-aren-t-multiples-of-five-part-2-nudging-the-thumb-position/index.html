<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I prevent users from using the mouse to drag the trackbar thumb to positions that aren’t multiples of five? Part 2: Nudging the thumb position</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, we investigated one approach to the problem of keeping a trackbar position on multiples of five: Just divide everything by five! (And then multiply by five when you read the value.) This works great, except that accessibility tools report the range as 0–20 in one-unit increments, even though you are presenting it to the user as a range of 0–100 in five-unit increments. </p>
<p>So it’s back to the drawing board. This time, we’ll leave the range at 0–100 and manipulate the trackbar position in the <code>TRBN_</code><code>THUMB­POS­CHANGING</code> notification. </p>
<p>Take our program from last time and make the following changes: </p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">#pragma comment(linker, \
    "\"/manifestdependency:type='win32' \
    name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' \
    version='6.0.0.0' \
    processorArchitecture='*' \
    publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' \
    language='*'\"")</font>
</pre>
<p>This <code>#pragma</code> is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">a quick way to enable version 6 of the common controls</a>. </p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TRACKBAR_CLASS, TEXT(""),
    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE <font color="blue">| TBS_NOTIFYBEFOREMOVE</font>,
   0, 0, 100, 100,
    hwnd, (HMENU)100, g_hinst, 0);

  <font color="blue">SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETLINESIZE, 0, 5);
  SendMessage(g_hwndChild, TBM_SETPAGESIZE, 0, 20);</font>

  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>TBS_</code><code>NOTIFY­BEFORE­MOVE</code> style enables the <code>TRBN_</code><code>THUMB­POS­CHANGING</code> notification, which we will take advantage of below. We leave the range at its default of 0–100 and set the line size and page size to the desired multiples of five. </p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">LRESULT OnNotify(HWND hwnd, int idCtl, NMHDR* pnm)
{
 if (pnm-&gt;hwndFrom == g_hwndChild &amp;&amp;
     pnm-&gt;code == TRBN_THUMBPOSCHANGING) {
  auto ptpc = (NMTRBTHUMBPOSCHANGING*)pnm;
  auto pos = ptpc-&gt;dwPos;
  auto newpos = (pos + 2) / 5 * 5;
  if (pos != newpos) {
    SendMessage(pnm-&gt;hwndFrom, TBM_SETPOS, TRUE, newpos);
    return TRUE; // we moved the thumb, so the control doesn't have to
  }
 }
 return 0;
}
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NOTIFY, OnNotify);</font>
</pre>
<p>When we are being notified that the thumb is about to move, we take the proposed new position and round it to the nearest multiple of five. If that produces a value different from what the control would have done, then we manually set the thumb position to the desired multiple of five and return <code>TRUE</code> to tell the trackbar that it shouldn’t move the trackbar thumb (because we moved it). </p>
<p>(And again, don’t forget that if this is happening in a dialog box, you need to use <code>DWLP_</code><code>MSG­RESULT</code> to make the dialog box return a nonzero value from its window procedure.) </p>
