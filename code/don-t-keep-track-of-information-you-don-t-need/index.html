This is sort of an extreme corollary to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/20/327369.aspx">
<i>Don’t save anything you can recalculate</i></a>.
Sure, it sounds like such an obvious principle,
but many people fail to understand its consequences.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at the principle again.
<i>Don’t keep track of information you don’t need</i>.
I remember being asked to look at a customer’s program,
and one thing that struck me was that the program had
a bazillion different flag variables that it spent a lot of time
setting and clearing. Here’s an oversimplified example:
</p>
<pre>
void CConfiguration::ShowDialog(HWND hwnd)
{
  m_fShowingDialog = true;
  DoModal(hwnd);
  m_fShowingDialog = false;
  m_fDialogHasBeenShown = true;
}
</pre>
<p>
A naïve reading of the code would lead one to believe that
the main purpose of the program was to set and clear flags!
Upon closer inspection, I found that most of the flag
variables were write-only.
Although the code went to great pains to update the flags
as it ran,
there was no code that actually cared whether the flag was set or not.
</p>
<p>
I asked the customer liaison about this, thinking that maybe
I missed something.
Maybe the variables were being used in a subtle way that I failed
to appreciate.
Maybe they were used during debugging.
</p>
<p>
The customer liaison got back to me.
“When I asked them about it, they just said, ‘Ah, yes.’
Apparently that code was written by one of their guys named Bob.
I guess he likes to set and clear flags a lot.”
</p>
<p>
<i>But is there any code that actually checks the values of those flags?</i>
</p>
<p>
“Probably not.
He just set and cleared those flags because he figured maybe someday
he might need them.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, once in a while, he actually tested one of the dozens of flags
he spent most of his time setting and resetting.
But the vast majority of the flags were write-only.
(And since most of the flags went unused,
I suspect that many of them weren’t even accurate.)
</p>
<p>
Obviously, this is an extreme case of write-only variables,
but it illustrates the point.
Next time, we’ll look at one of the consequences of the principle
of not keeping track of information you don’t need.
