<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the difference between WINVER, _WIN32_WINNT, _WIN32_WINDOWS, and _WIN32_IE?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Okay, so there are
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/10/2065725.aspx">
all these different ways you can specify
what version of the Windows header files you want</a>.†
</p>
<pre>
#define WINVER         0x0400
#define _WIN32_WINNT   0x0400
#define _WIN32_WINDOWS 0x0400
#define _WIN32_IE      0x0400
</pre>
<p>
Let’s take them in order.
</p>
<p>
The <code>WINVER</code> symbol is the earliest one.
That’s the symbol that 16-bit Windows used to control the
versioning of its header files,
and its use carried forward into the 32-bit header files,
presumably from the people who did the initial conversion
of the header files to 32-bit and who grew up with the
<code>WINVER</code> symbol.
This symbol is still used a lot in the header files that
can trace their origins to 16-bit Windows, such as
<code>winuser.h</code>,
<code>wingdi.h</code>, and
<code>mmsystem.h</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>_WIN32_WINNT</code> symbol came next.
I’m not sure where it came from, but from its name
it probably was invented by the Windows NT team
in order to allow them to block off sections of the
header file that are available only in the Windows NT implementation
of Win32.
Don’t forget that in the early days, there was also Win32s,
a subset of Win32 that could run on 16-bit Windows 3.1.
The single <code>WINVER</code> symbol wasn’t enough to
specify exactly what you wanted to be compatible with.
For example, a function available only in Windows NT 3.1
would be guarded with <code>#if _WIN32_WINNT &gt;= 0x030A</code>
so that programs that wanted to run on Win32s could set
<code>_WIN32_WINNT</code> to zero and keep that function off-limits.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4 identified
themselves as Windows major version 4, so
the <code>WINVER</code> symbol was insufficient to distinguish them.
Functions that existed in Windows NT 4 but
not in Window 95 were therefore guarded with <code>_WIN32_WINNT</code>.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there were also functions that were first introduced
in Windows 95 and did not exist in
the original version of Windows NT 4.
The <code>_WIN32_WINDOWS</code> symbol let you specify that
you wanted access to stuff that was new for Windows 95 and
which would also be ported to Windows NT 4 and future
versions of Windows NT.
</p>
<p>
The next symbol in this progression is
<code>_WIN32_IE</code>, which lets you specify what version
of Internet Explorer you require to be installed on the system.
This was more important back in the days when Internet Explorer
included updates to selected operating system components.
For example, Internet Explorer 4 came not only with an
updated <code>comctl32.dll</code> but also a new
<code>shell32.dll</code> that gave you Active Desktop.
(Wow, remember Active Desktop?
That was when everybody thought that HTML
was going to take over the world and people would write
entire applications in HTML.
People are still trying.)
</p>
<p>
And history repeated itself:
We saw it before when we tried to puzzle out why
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/02/82639.aspx">
some functions return
<code>NULL</code> while others return <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code></a>.
Each time somebody added a new feature to Windows and had to
add an <code>#ifdef</code> guard,
it was pretty much a toss-up whether they would use
<code>WINVER</code>,
<code>_WIN32_WINDOWS</code>, or
<code>_WIN32_WINNT</code>.
Once Internet Explorer stopped including updates to shell components,
<code>_WIN32_IE</code> fell into the “toss-up” bucket as well.
</p>
<p>
In an attempt to make some sense out of this disaster,
the SDK and DDK teams came up with a new plan for Windows Vista
header files:
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383745.aspx">
sdkddkver.h</a>.
There’s now just one symbol you define to specify your minimum
target operating system: <code>NTDDI_VERSION</code>.
Once you set that, all the other symbols are set automatically
to the appropriate values for your target operating system.
(And no, I don’t know what the letters NTDDI stand for,
though there is one
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789534.aspx">
obvious candidate</a>.)
With any luck,
everybody wll standardize on
<code>NTDDI_VERSION</code> and this article will become one of those
“quaint historical novelties” like all the ones about
16-bit Windows.
Just “a little story about what people had to do back in the
crazy days of the early 21st century.
Boy am I glad we don’t have to worry about that any more!”

<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<p>
I’d appreciate it if people would extend me the courtesy of not
stepping on my announced topic.
(I wonder if these are the same people who go to a comedy show
and shout out the punch lines before the performer gets to say them.)
I did say that I would pick up the topic today, after all.

If you really want to steal my topic</a>,
at least be polite enough to post your essay on your own blog.
