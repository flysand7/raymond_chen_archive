<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On the abuse of properties</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One thing that I see occasionally is the abuse of property syntax.
IDispatch and CLR objects (and C++ objects if you want to avail
yourself of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccelng/htm/msmod_30.asp">
a Microsoft-specific extension</a>)
support “properties”, which syntactically look like fields
but internally are treated as a pair of methods (“get” and “put”).
An important principle is that given an object <code>o</code>
and a property <code>p</code>, the lines
</p>
<pre>
(void)o.p;
o.p = o.p;
</pre>
<p>
should be effectively nops.
(Mind you, they might be really inefficient nops.)
</p>
<p>
My favorite (or perhaps most hated) example of violating this
principle is an object I saw many years ago that had a “print”
property, which if set to true, caused the object to send itself
to the printer.
If you did
</p>
<pre>
o.print = true;
o.print = true;
</pre>
<p>
then two copies of the object were printed.
</p>
<p>
Property syntax mimics field syntax for a reason:
Properties should behave like fields.
</p>
<p>
(Plenty more guidance on properties can be found in the

.NET Framework Property Usage Guidelines</a>.)
