The details have been changed since they aren’t important
but the lesson is the same.
</p>
<p>
A customer had the following problem with a command-line tool:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I’ve created a taglist but I can’t seem to get it to work
with the <code>track</code> command.
When I ask it to track the taglist, it can’t find it.
But if I ask for all my taglists, there it is.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; show taglists
You have 2 taglists:
 active (8 tags)
 closed (6 tags)
C:\&gt; track active
No such tag "active".
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, the <code>track</code> command isn’t working,
but let’s take a closer look at that error message.
It says <code>no such tag</code>.
Strange, because you are trying to track a taglist, not a tag.
Shouldn’t the error message be
<code>no such taglist</code>?
</p>
<p>
Aha, the problem is that the <code>track</code> command takes
a list of tags on the command line, not a taglist name.
The error message is correct:
There is no such tag called <code>active</code>.
Because <code>active</code> isn’t a tag name;
it’s a taglist name.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; track -taglist active
Taglist "active" is now being tracked.
</pre>
<p>
Today’s lesson:
Look carefully at what the error message complaining about;
it may not be what you expect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Diagnose the following error message, given no information
about the program being used beyond what is presented here:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
I accidentally made a change (transaction number 12345)
to the file XYZ,
and I want to back it out.
But when I run the <i>backout</i> command, I get an error.
Can somebody help me?
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; backout 12345
12345 - file not found
</pre>
