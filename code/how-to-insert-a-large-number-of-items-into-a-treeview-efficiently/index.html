<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to insert a large number of items into a treeview efficiently</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Just a quick tip today.
</p>
<p>
If you need to insert a large number of items into a treeview,
like tens of thousands,
then it’s much more efficient to insert them “backwards”.
(I’m ignoring for now the usability question of having a treeview
that large in the first place.)
In other words, instead of
</p>
<pre>
for (i = 0; i &lt; array.Count(); i++) {
 TVINSERTSTRUCT tvis;
 tvis.hParent = hParentNode;
 tvis.hInsertAfter = TVIF_LAST;
 tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT;
 item.item.pszText = array[i].Text();
 TreeView_InsertItem(hwndTreeView, &amp;tvis);
}
</pre>
<p>do it this way:</p>
<pre>
for (<font color="blue">i = array.Count() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--</font>) {
 TVINSERTSTRUCT tvis;
 tvis.hParent = hParentNode;
 tvis.hInsertAfter = <font color="blue">TVIF_FIRST</font>;
 tvis.item.mask = TVIF_TEXT;
 item.item.pszText = array[i].Text();
 TreeView_InsertItem(hwndTreeView, &amp;tvis);
}
</pre>
<p>
Why is backwards-insertion faster?
</p>
<p>
It has to do with the annoying
<code>hInsert­After</code> parameter.
To validate that the
<code>hInsert­After</code> parameter is valid,
the treeview needs to verify that the
<code>hInsert­After</code> is a valid child of the
<code>hParent</code>,
and this is done by walking the parent’s children
looking for a match.
The sooner you find the match, the faster the validation completes.
(And if you pass
<code>TVI_LAST</code>,
then the treeview needs to walk to the end of the child list.)
</p>
<p>
You’d think that you could verify the parent/child relationship
by just doing a
<code>Tree­View_Get­Parent(hInsert­After)</code>,
but that turns out not to be strict enough, because
<code>hInsert­After</code> might itself not be a valid parameter.
If <code>hInsert­After</code> is a bogus value,
then you may crash when you try to read its Parent property.
That’s if you’re lucky.
If you’re not lucky,
then the random memory that
<code>hInsert­After</code> points to might look just enough
like a valid <code>HTREEITEM</code> that you end up inserting
the new node after a completely bogus node,
and now the treeview has become corrupted.
</p>
<p>
Sure, you got the same problem if you passed a garbage
<code>HTREEITEM</code> to
<code>Tree­View_Get­Parent</code>,
but in that case, it’s just garbage in garbage out.
Nothing gets corrupted;
the application just gets a garbage result.
But in the case of
<code>Tree­View_Insert­Item</code>,
the treeview is going to update its internal data structures
based on the garbage you passed in,
and that means that the treeview winds up corrupted.
</p>
<p>
To ensure that the value passed in is valid,
the treeview checks it against the list of valid values for
<code>hInsert­After</code>.
And therefore, you get better performance if the valid value
you pass is the one that it checks first.
</p>
<p>
(As it happens, a <i>lot</i> of programs pass garbage
for <code>hInsert­After</code>,
so this defensive validation step is absolutely necessary.)
</p>
<p>
You might say that the treeview could have a one-off optimization
for the special
<code>TVI_LAST</code> value by remembering the last child
so it can be located quickly.
The question is whether the complexity of adding that optimization
is worth the cost:
Any tree rearranging function would have to update the
cached value, and if you miss a spot,
then the treeview ends up corrupted.
That’s a pretty high-risk optimization you’re suggesting there.
</p>
<p>
And think about it this way:
You’re worrying about a tree where a single node
has tens of thousands of children,
something which (I am no longer ignoring) is a horrible user interface.
That’s like a list box with tens of thousands of items,
or a dialog box with tens of thousands of checkboxes.
You’ll probably want to consider a better way of presenting
the information than in a tree view that goes on for
hundreds of screens.
The treeview isn’t optimized for this case because

you don’t optimize for the case where somebody is mis-using your system</a>.</p>
