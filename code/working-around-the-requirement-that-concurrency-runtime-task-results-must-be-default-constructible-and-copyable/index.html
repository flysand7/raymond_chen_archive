<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Working around the requirement that Concurrency Runtime task results must be default-constructible and copyable</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/code/hidden-constraints-on-the-result-type-in-concurrency-runtime-tasks" title="Hidden constraints on the result type in Concurrency Runtime tasks"> Last time</a>, we shed light on the hidden constraints on the result type in Concurrency Runtime tasks: The result type must have a public default constructor, and it must be copyable.</p>
<p>But what if your desired result type doesn’t satisfy these requirements?</p>
<p>To work around the need for a public default constructor, you can wrap your result type inside something that does have a public default constructor, such as <code>std::optional</code>.</p>
<pre>Concurrency::task&lt;std::optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;
    t([]() { return T::make(); });
</pre>
<p>If you produce the result from a lambda, you can just return a <code>T</code>, and a <code>std::optional&lt;T&gt;</code> will be constructed from it. If you produce the result from a <code>task_</code><code>completion_</code><code>event</code>, you’ll have to use a <code>task_</code><code>completion_</code><code>event&lt;std::optional&lt;</code><code>T&gt;&gt;</code>. The result of the task will be an <code>optional&lt;T&gt;</code>, and you can use the dereference operator <code>*</code> to extract the value. (This assumes that the task always completes with a value, which I assume it does, because that’s what it did before you started down this path.)</p>
<p>To work around the need for copyability, you can wrap the result in a <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>. That way, there is still only one <code>T</code> object, and all the continuations get the shared copy.</p>
<p>And since <code>std::shared_ptr</code> has a public default constructor, if your result type falls into both categories (lacks a public default constructor, is not copyable), you can wrap it in a <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> and solve both problems.</p>
