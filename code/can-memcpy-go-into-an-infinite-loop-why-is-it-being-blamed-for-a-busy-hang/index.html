<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can memcpy go into an infinite loop? Why is it being blamed for a busy hang?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that their program locks up once or twice each day. They took a full dump of the file while it was hung and asked <code>windbg</code> to analyze it. Here’s a redacted version of what it said: </p>
<pre>
PRIMARY_PROBLEM_CLASS: APPLICATION_HANG_BusyHang

STACK_TEXT:  
msvcr80!_memcpy+0x7d
contoso!Buffer::Compact+0x3d
contoso!BufferReader::Parse+0x14c
contoso!handle_widget_message+0x37
contoso!handle_input+0x12f
contoso!dispatch_event+0x27
contoso!handle_events+0xbe
</pre>
<p>The <code>Buffer::Compact</code> method shifts some memory around inside the buffer: </p>
<pre>
void Buffer::Compact()
{
  if (m_bytesRead &gt; 0) {
    memmove(m_buffer, m_buffer + m_bytesRead, m_capacity - m_bytesRead);
    m_capacity -= m_bytesRead;
    m_bytesRead = 0;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>“Is it possible that <code>memmove</code> has a busy wait? What could it be waiting for?” </p>
<p>The <code>memmove</code> function doesn’t have a busy loop where it waits for something. It just moves the memory from one location to another. </p>
<p>What’s probably happening is that there is a busy loop higher up the stack. Maybe  <code>Buffer­Reader::Parse</code> has gotten into a loop, or (my guess) <code>handle_events</code> is stuck in a loop processing a huge number of incoming events. </p>
<p>When you take the memory dump, you are capturing the program at a moment in time. All you know is that the thread is probably in a busy wait, but the source of the busy wait need not be the thing at the top of the stack. </p>
<p>If <code>memcpy</code> is consistently at the top of the stack, then it means that the thread is spending most of its time copying memory. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that <code>memcpy</code> is stuck in a loop. The more likely reason is that the thread is busy doing some larger operation, and that larger operation entails a lot of <code>memcpy</code> operations. </p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: The customer’s code calls <code>memmove</code>, so why is the <code>memcpy</code> function the one at the top of the stack? What happened to <code>memmove</code>? </p>
