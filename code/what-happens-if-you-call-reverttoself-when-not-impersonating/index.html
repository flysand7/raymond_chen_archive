<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happens if you call RevertToSelf when not impersonating?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know what happens if you call <code>Revert­To­Self</code> from a thread that is not impersonating. “Does the call succeed or fail? This particular scenario is not explicitly discussed in the documentation. We have a bunch of places in our code that say <code>if (impersonating) RevertToSelf();</code> and we were wondering whether the <code>if</code> test was really necessary.” </p>
<p>The answer to the question is that calling <code>Revert­To­Self</code> when the thread is not impersonating will return success without doing anything (because the thread is already not impersonating). </p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean that you can blindly remove all your <code>if</code> tests. You don’t want to over-revert either. Consider: </p>
<pre>
// Error checking elided for expository purposes.
void DoSomething()
{
 bool impersonating = false;

 if (!ThreadIsAlreadyImpersonating() &amp;&amp;
     ImpersonationIsNeeded()) {
   StartImpersonating();
   impersonating = true;
 }

 DoWork();

 if (impersonating) {
  RevertToSelf();
 }
}
</pre>
<p>If you remove the <code>if (impersonating)</code> and unconditionally revert, then you have a security defect if the thread was already impersonating, because your modified code will unconditionally revert and prematurely end the existing impersonation.  </p>
<p>So yes, it’s okay to call <code>Revert­To­Self</code> when the thread is not impersonating, but that doesn’t relieve you of the responsiblity of knowing when to revert. </p>
