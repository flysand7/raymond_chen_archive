<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Pitfalls in handling the WM_CONTEXTMENU message</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Before we continue with our IContextMenu discussion,
I need to take a little side trip and discuss the subtleties
of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Resources/Menus/MenuReference/MenuMessages/WM_CONTEXTMENU.asp">
the WM_CONTEXTMENU message</a>.
</p>
<p>
First, a correction to the existing &lt;windowsx.h&gt; header file:
</p>
<pre>
#undef HANDLE_WM_CONTEXTMENU
#define HANDLE_WM_CONTEXTMENU(hwnd, wParam, lParam, fn) \
    ((fn)((hwnd), (HWND)(wParam), <font color="blue">GET_X_LPARAM(lParam), GET_Y_LPARAM(lParam)</font>), 0L)
</pre>
<p>
Apparently, HANDLE_WM_CONTEXTMENU was overlooked when the
&lt;windowsx.h&gt; header file gained multimonitor support.
</p>
<p>
The second subtlety of the WM_CONTEXTMENU message is the
recognition that context menus can be invoked from the keyboard,
not just by the mouse.  If you have a 104-key keyboard, you
will probably have a menu key to the right of your space bar.
(Laptop owners: You’re on your own.  Laptop keyboards are hardly
standardized.)  Alternatively, you can type Shift+F10 to get
the same effect.
</p>
<p>
When the user invokes a context menu from the keyboard, the
x and y coordinates are both -1.  In this case, you should
display the context menu for the currently-selected item
(or items, if a multiple selection is active).
If you miss this detail, then you will end up hit-testing
against (-1, -1) and probably not find anything.
</p>
<p>
Okay, now that these remarks on the WM_CONTEXTMENU message are
out of the way, we can return to our discussion of the
IContextMenu interface
