<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't SHGetKnownFolderPath return the customized path?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported that the
<code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function
was not working correctly.
They moved their Videos folder to a new location,
but when they called
<code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code>,
they got the old path rather than the new one.
</p>
<p>
A quick check of the code they provided showed why:
</p>
<pre>
 ...
 SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_Videos,
                      KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY |
                      KF_FLAG_DEFAULT_PATH,
                      NULL,
                      &amp;pszPath);
</pre>
<p>
Um, you’re passing the
<code>KF_FLAG_DEFAULT_PATH</code> flag.
That flag means
“Tell me where this folder <i>would have been</i>
if its location had never been customized.”
Therefore,
if you pass this flag,
you have no right to complain that it’s returning
a path different from the customized path.
Because passing that flag means “I don’t want
the customized path.”</p>
