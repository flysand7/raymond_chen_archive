<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don't use global state to manage a local problem, practical exam</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There was much speculation as to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/30/8790272.aspx"> how the “Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange” setting got set</a>. Well, <a href="http://www.belshe.com/2006/11/29/excel-programming-and-ignoreremoterequests/"> one possibility</a> is that somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx"> used global state to manage a local problem</a>.
 “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/30/8790272.aspx#8792614">Why on earth does this setting exist?</a>” I don’t know, but there appear to be scripts which rely on it.
 The setting is exposed to scripts, and perhaps at some point you ran a script which didn’t want Excel to be interrupted while it was running. The documentation for the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa213696(office.11).aspx"> Excel Application Object</a> does say that it contains application-wide (global) settings.
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/14/1676656.aspx"> I’m not saying that’s why <i>you</i> are encountering the problem</a>, but it’s just one possibility I ran across while doing some Web searching to learn more about the setting.</p>
<p> One of those Web searches took me to <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/bradley/"> Susan Bradley (the SBS Diva)</a> who gave one reason why somebody would enable this checkbox: <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/bradley/archive/2008/07/30/one-fix-creates-another-problem.aspx"> It shuts up a different warning</a>. </p>
