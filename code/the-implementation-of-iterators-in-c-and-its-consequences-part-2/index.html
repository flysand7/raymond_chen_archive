<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The implementation of iterators in C# and its consequences (part 2)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Now that you have
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849519.aspx">
the basic idea behind iterators</a>
under your belt, you can already answer some questions
on iterator usage.
Here’s a scenario based on actual events:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
I have an iterator that is rather long and complicated,
so I’d like to refactor it.
For illustrative purposes, let’s say that the enumerator
counts from 1 to 100 twice.
(In real life, of course, the iterator will not be this simple.)
</p>
<pre>
IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountTo100Twice()
{
 int i;
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
  yield return i;
 }
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
  yield return i;
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
As we learned in
Programming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_%28number%29">101</a>,
we can pull common code into a subroutine and call the subroutine.
But when I do this, I get a compiler error:
</p>
<pre>
IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountTo100Twice()
{
 CountTo100();
 CountTo100();
}</pre></blockquote></p>
<p>void CountTo100()
{
 int i;
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
  yield return i;
 }
}

<p>
What am I doing wrong?
How can I move the “count to 100” into a subroutine
and call it twice from the <code>CountTo100Twice</code> function?
</p>

<p>
As we saw last time,
iterators are not coroutines.
The technique above would have worked great 
had we
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/31/344799.aspx">
built iterators out of, say, fibers</a>
instead of building them out of state machines.
As state machines, all <code>yield return</code> statements
must occur at the “top level”.
So how do you iterate with the help of subroutines?
</p>
<p>
You make the subroutine its own iterator
and suck the results out from the main function:
</p>
<pre>
IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountTo100Twice()
{
 foreach (int i in CountTo100()) yield return i;
 foreach (int i in CountTo100()) yield return i;
}</pre></p>
<p>IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountTo100()
{
 for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
  yield return i;
 }
}

<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Consider the following fragment:
</p>
<pre>
 foreach (int i in CountTo100Twice()) {
  …
 }
</pre>
<p>
Explain what happens on the 150th call to
<code>MoveNext()</code> in the above loop.
Discuss its consequences for recursive enumerators
(such as tree traversal).
