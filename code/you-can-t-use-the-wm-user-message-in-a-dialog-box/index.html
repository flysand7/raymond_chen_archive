<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can't use the WM_USER message in a dialog box</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today, I’m not actually going to say anything new.
I’m just going to collate information I’ve already written
under a better title to improve search engine optimization.
</p>
<p>
A customer reported that they did the following but found
that it didn’t work:
</p>
<pre>
#define MDM_SETITEMCOUNT WM_USER
INT_PTR CALLBACK MyDlgProc(HWND hdlg, UINT wm, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
  switch (wm) {
  ...
  case MDM_SETITEMCOUNT:
    SetDlgItemInt(hwnd, IDC_ITEMCOUNT, (UINT)wParam, FALSE);
    return TRUE;
  ...
  }
  return FALSE;
}
</pre>
<p>
“I send the <code>MDM_SET­ITEM­COUNT</code> message
to my dialog, but the value doesn’t stick.
At random times, the value resets back to zero.”
</p>
<p>
As we saw some time ago,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/02/55914.aspx">
window messages in the <code>WM_USER</code> range belong to the
window class</a>.
In the case of a dialog box, the window class is the dialog class,
and the owner of the class is the window manager itself.
An application which tries to use the
<code>WM_USER</code> message is using window messages it does not own.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that the dialog manager already defined the
<code>WM_USER</code> message:
</p>
<pre>
#define DM_GETDEFID         (WM_USER+0)
</pre>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/25/770536.aspx">
We saw this problem some time ago</a>
when we tried to find a message we could use for custom use
in a dialog box.
</p>
<p>
What the customer is seeing is that whenever the dialog manager
sends a <code>DM_GET­DEF­ID</code> message to the dialog box
to get the default control ID,
the <code>MyDlgProc</code> function mistakenly thinks that it’s
a
<code>MDM_SET­ITEM­COUNT</code> message and
sets the item count to whatever happens to be in the
<code>wParam</code> (which happens to be zero).
On top of that, it claims to have handled the message,
which means that the current value of
<code>DWL_MSG­RESULT</code> is returned to the sender
(probably zero),
so the dialog manager thinks that there is no default ID on the dialog.
</p>
<p>
The solution,
as noted in that same article, is to use <code>WM_APP</code>
instead of <code>WM_USER</code>.
Because you don’t have permission to define messages in the
<code>WM_USER</code> range if you aren’t the owner of the window class.</p>
