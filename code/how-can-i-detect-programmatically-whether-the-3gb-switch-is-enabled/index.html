<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I detect programmatically whether the /3GB switch is enabled?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer was doing some diagnostic work and wanted a way to detect
whether the
<code>/3GB</code> switch was enabled.
(Remember that the <code>/3GB</code> switch is
meaningful only for 32-bit versions of Windows.)
</p>
<p>
The way to detect the setting is to call
<code>Get­System­Info</code> and look at the
<code>lp­Maximum­Application­Address</code>.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int __cdecl main(int, char **)
{
 SYSTEM_INFO si;
 GetSystemInfo(&amp;si);
 printf("%p", si.lpMaximumApplicationAddress);
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Compile this <i>as a 32-bit program</i>
and run it.

On 32-bit systems, this reports the system-wide setting that
specifies the maximum user-mode address space,
regardless of how your application is marked.
Note, however, that your application must be marked
<code>LARGE­ADDRESS­AWARE</code>
in order to take advantage of the space above 2GB.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
when you run a 32-bit application on 64-bit Windows,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/22/9244582.aspx">
it runs the application in an emulation layer</a>.
Therefore, 64-bit Windows can give each application a different view of
the system.
In particular, depending on how your application is marked,
Windows can emulate a 32-bit system with or without the
<code>/3GB</code> switch enabled,
based on what the application prefers.

Armed with this knowledge, perhaps you can help this customer.
Remember, you sometimes need to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/20/10427187.aspx">
go beyond simply answering the question
and actually solve the customer’s problem</a>.

<p>
We would like to know how to detect from our 32-bit application
whether the host operating system is 64-bit or 32-bit.
</p>
<p>
We need to know this because our program does some data processing,
and we have to choose an appropriate algorithm.
We have written one algorithm that is faster but uses
1½<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">GB</a>
of address space,
and we have also written
a fallback algorithm that is slower but does not
use anywhere near as much address space.
When running on a native 32-bit system,
there is typically not 1½GB of address space available,
so we have to use the slow algorithm.
But when running on a native 64-bit system
(or a native 32-bit system with the <code>/3GB</code> switch enabled),
our program can use the fast algorithm.
Therefore, we would like to detect
whether the native operating system
is 64-bit so that we can decide whether to use the fast or slow algorithm.

Here’s another customer question you can now answer:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
We have a 64-bit program, and since we know that Windows currently
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx#memory_limits">
does not use the full 64-bit address space</a>,
we would like to
steal the upper bits of the pointer to hold additional information:
If there are at least 8 bits available, we can use a more efficient
data format.
Otherwise, we fall back to a less efficient format.
How can we detect whether the upper 8 bits are being used for
addressing?
