<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The interaction between AppBars and Windows 10 virtual desktops</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a question about the interaction between <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/cc144177.aspx">Application Desktop Toolbars</a> (commonly known as AppBars) and Windows 10 virtual desktops. “When we create our AppBar, it is shown on all virtual desktops. Is this expected behavior? Can I limit it to only one virtual desktop?” </p>
<p>Yes, this is expected behavior. AppBars modify the work area of the monitor they appear on, and the work area is global across all virtual desktops. As a result, AppBars are also global across all virtual desktops. </p>
