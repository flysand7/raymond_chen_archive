<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does it mean when GetQueuedCompletionStatus return ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer asked for assistance interpreting a failure of the <code>Get­Queued­Completion­Status</code> function.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  We are observing that <code>Get­Queued­Completion­Status</code> is intermittently behaving as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>The handle is a <code>SOCKET</code>. </li>
<li>The function returns <code>FALSE</code>. </li>
<li><code>lpOverlapped != NULL</code>. </li>
<li><code>Get­Last­Error</code> reports     <code>ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT</code>:     “The semaphore timeout period has expired.” </li>
</ul>
<p> That’s all the information we have in our log files. We don’t know the value of <code>number­Of­Bytes</code> or <code>completion­Key</code>, sorry. </p>
<p> We realize that this is a rather vague question, but when this problem hits our machines, it causes our internal logic to go into a reset state since it doesn’t know what the error means or how to recover. Resetting is expensive, and we would prefer to handle this error in a less drastic manner, if only we knew what it meant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The error code <code>ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT</code> is a rather bad translation of the underlying status code <code>STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT</code>, which is much more meaningful. It means that the I/O operation timed out.
 Colleagues of mine from the networking team chimed in with additional information:
 A common source of this error with TCP sockets is that the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/170359"> maximum retransmission count and timeout have been reached</a> on a bad (or broken) link.</p>
<p> If you know that the handle is a socket, then you can use <code>WSA­Get­Overlapped­Result</code> on the <code>lpOverlapped</code> that got returned. Winsock will convert the status code to something more Winsocky. In this case, it would have given you <code>WSA­ETIMED­OUT</code>, which makes it clearer what happened. </p>
