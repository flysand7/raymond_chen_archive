<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Psychic debugging: Why does ExitProcess(1) produce an exit code of zero?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Here’s a question that came from a customer. By now, you should already have the necessary psychic powers to answer it. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Our program calls <code>ExitProcess(1)</code> to indicate that it exited unsuccessfully. The process that launched our program waits for the program to exit and then calls <code>GetExitCodeProcess</code> to retrieve the exit code. The function succeeds, but the exit code is zero! How can this be? </p></blockquote>
