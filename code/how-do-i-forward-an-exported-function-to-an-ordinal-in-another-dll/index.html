<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I forward an exported function to an ordinal in another DLL?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The syntax for specifying that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/04/7439592.aspx">
requests to import a function from your
DLL should be forwarded to another DLL</a>
is
</p>
<pre>
; A.DEF
EXPORTS
 Dial = B.Call
</pre>
<p>
This says that if somebody tries to call <code>Dial()</code> from
<code>A.DLL</code>,
they are really calling <code>Call()</code> in <code>B.DLL</code>.
This forwarding is done in the loader.
Normally,
when a client links to the function
<code>A!Dial</code>,
the loader says,
“Okay, let me get the address of the <code>Dial</code> function
in <code>A.DLL</code> and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/21/673830.aspx">
store it into the
<code>__imp__Dial</code> variable</a>.”
It’s the logical equivalent of
</p>
<pre>
client::__imp__Dial = GetProcAddress(hinstA, "Dial");
</pre>
<p>
When you use a forwarder,
the loader sees the forwarder entry and says,
“Whoa, I’m not actually supposed to get the function from <code>A.DLL</code>
at all!
I’m supposed to get the function <code>Call</code> from <code>B.DLL</code>!”
So it loads <code>B.DLL</code> and gets the function
<code>Call</code> from it.
</p>
<pre>
hinstB = LoadLibrary("B.DLL");
client::__imp__Dial = GetProcAddress(B, "Call");
</pre>
<p>
(Of course, the loader doesn’t actually do it this way,
but this is a good way of thinking about it.)
</p>
<p>
But what if the function <code>Call</code> was exported by ordinal?
How do you tell the linker,
“Please create a forwarder entry for <code>Dial</code> that forwards
to function 42 in <code>B.DLL</code>?”
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know, but I was able to guess.
</p>
<p>
Back in the days of 16-bit Windows, there were two ways to obtain
the address of a function exported by ordinal.
The first way is the way most people are familiar with:
</p>
<pre>
FARPROC fp = GetProcAddress(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(42));
</pre>
<p>
The second way uses an alternate formulation,
passing the desired ordinal as a string prefixed with the number-sign:
</p>
<pre>
FARPROC fp = GetProcAddress(hinst, "#42");
</pre>
<p>
You can hide a number inside a string by using
<code>MAKEINTRESOURCE</code>,
and you can hide a string inside a number by using the ‘#’ character.
</p>
<p>
Given that the number sign has been used in the past to hide
a number inside a string,
I figured it was worth a shot to see if the loader carried this
convention forward.
(No pun intended.)
</p>
<pre>
; A.DEF
EXPORTS
 Dial = B.#1
</pre>
<p>
Hey, check it out. It works.

Sometimes a little knowledge of history actually helps you solve
problems in the present day.</p>
