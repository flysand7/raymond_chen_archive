<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nasty gotcha: Powershell aliases that match commands you might want to run</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>PowerShell has a bunch of aliases, but some of them collide with programs you might want to run. </p>
<pre>
PowerShell Get-Alias
</pre>
<p>will print all the aliases. These two conflict with programs that come with Windows: </p>
<ul>
<li> <code>sc</code>: <code>Set-Content</code> vs. <code>sc.exe</code>     (service control) </li>
<li> <code>fc</code>: <code>Format-Custom</code> vs. <code>fc.exe</code>     (file compare) </li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve seen email threads where somebody says, for example, </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Try running these commands: </p>
<pre>
sc stop someservice
some-command-to-reconfigure-the-service
sc start someservice
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>and the other person says, “It doesn’t work.” When I run the second command, it says that it cannot reconfigure the service because it is already running.” </p>
<p>Eventually, we figure out that the reason is that the other person uses PowerShell as their default command shell, and the command happens to collide with a PowerShell alias. What’s particularly devious is that <code>Set-Content</code> command is happy  to accept <code>start someservice</code> as its command line. It creates a text file called <code>start</code> with the contents <code>someService</code>. </p>
