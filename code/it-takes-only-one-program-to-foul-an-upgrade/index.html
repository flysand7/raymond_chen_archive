<p> “<a href="http://blog.devstone.com/aaron/archive/2005/02/06/446.aspx">Worst software ever</a>.” That was  <a href="http://blog.devstone.com/aaron/archive/2005/02/06/446.aspx"> Aaron Zupancic</a>‘s cousin’s reaction to the fact that Windows XP was incompatible with one program originally designed for Windows 98. </p>
<p> Then again, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/18/355177.aspx"> commenter Aargh! says</a> “The bad code should be fixed, period. If it can’t be fixed, it breaks, too bad.” Perhaps Aargh! can send a message to Aaron’s cousin saying, “Too bad.” I’m sure that’ll placate Aaron’s cousin. </p>
