<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does “Do not launch, but debug my code when it launches” mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Visual Studio has an option called <i>Do not launch, but debug my code when it launches.</i></p>
<p>For a long time, I was confused by this setting. It’s like telling someone, “Don’t drive my car, but wear a seat belt when you drive my car.”</p>
<p>I also tried to parse this as</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>(Do not launch, but debug my code) when it launches.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, “When my code launches, don’t launch it; just debug it.”</p>
<p>Which makes no sense. “When my code launches, don’t launch it.”</p>
<p>I eventually got clued in that both of those attempts at parsing the statement were incorrect. The intended parse is</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>Do not launch, but (debug my code when it launches).</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, “Don’t launch it right now. Wait for somebody <i>else</i> to launch it, and then debug it when that launch happens.”</p>
