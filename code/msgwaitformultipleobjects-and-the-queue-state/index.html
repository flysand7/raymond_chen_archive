<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">MsgWaitForMultipleObjects and the queue state</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One danger of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/msgwaitformultipleobjects.asp"> the <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> function</a> is calling it when there are already messages waiting to be processed, because <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> returns only when there is a <strong>new</strong> event in the queue.</p>
<p>In other words, consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE)</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> indicating that there is a message.</li>
<li>Instead of processing the message, you ignore it and call <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wait will <strong>not</strong> return immediately, even though there is a message in the queue. That’s because the call to <code>PeekMessage</code> told you that a message was ready, and you willfully ignored it. The <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> message tells you only when there are new messages; any message that you already knew about doesn’t count.</p>
<p>A common variation on this is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> returns that there is a message.</li>
<li>You call <code>PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)</code> and process that message.</li>
<li>You call <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> to wait for more messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it so happens that there were <strong>two</strong> messages in your queue, the <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> does not return immediately, because there are no new messages; there is an old message you willfully ignored, however.</p>
<p>When <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> tells you that there is a message in your message queue, you have to process <strong>all</strong> of the messages until <code>PeekMessage</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>, indicating that there are no more messages.</p>
<p>Note, however, that this sequence is not a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE)</code> returns <code>FALSE</code> indicating that there is no message.</li>
<li>A message is posted into your queue.</li>
<li>You call <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> and include the <code>QS_ALLPOSTMESSAGE</code> flag.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wait does return immediately, because the incoming posted message sets the “There is a new message in the queue that nobody knows about” flag, which <code>QS_ALLPOSTMESSAGE</code> matches and therefore causes <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</code> to return immediately.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/msgwaitformultipleobjectsex.asp"> The <code>MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx</code> function</a> lets you pass the <code>MWMO_INPUTAVAILABLE</code> flag to indicate that it should check for previously-ignored input.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, explain why the observed behavior with the following code is “Sometimes my program gets stuck and reports one fewer record than it should. I have to jiggle the mouse to get the value to update. After a while longer, it falls two behind, then three…”</p>
<pre>// Assume that there is a worker thread that processes records and
// posts a WM_NEWRECORD message for each new record.
BOOL WaitForNRecords(HANDLE h, UINT cRecordsExpected)
{
  MSG msg;
  UINT cRecords = 0;
  while (true) {
    switch (MsgWaitForMultipleObjects(1, &amp;h,
                         FALSE, INFINITE, QS_ALLINPUT)) {
    case WAIT_OBJECT_0:
      DoSomethingWith(h); // event has been signalled
      break;
    case WAIT_OBJECT_1:
      // we have a message - peek and dispatch it
      if (PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) {
        TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
        DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
      }
      if (SendMessage(hwndNotify, WM_GETRECORDCOUNT,
                      0, 0) &gt;= cRecordsExpected) {
        return TRUE; // we got enough records
      }
      break;
    default:
      return FALSE; // unexpected failure
    }
  }
}
</pre>
