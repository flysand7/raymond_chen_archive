<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't String.Format throw a FormatException if you pass too many parameters?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Welcome to CLR Week 2009.
As always, we start with a warm-up.
</p>
<p>
The <code>String.Format</code> method doesn’t throw a
<code>FormatException</code>
if you pass too many parameters,
but it does if you pass too few.
Why the asymmetry?
</p>
<p>
Well,
this is the type of asymmetry you see in the world a lot.
You need a ticket for each person that attends a concert.
If you have too few tickets, they won’t let you in.
If you have too many,
well, that’s a bit wasteful, but you can still get in;
the extras are ignored.
If you create an array with 10 elements and use only the first five,
nobody is going to raise an <code>ArrayBiggerThanNecessary</code> exception.
Similarly, the
<code>String.Format</code> message doesn’t mind if you pass
too many parameters; it just ignores the extras.
There’s nothing harmful about it, just a bit wasteful.
</p>
<p>
Besides, you probably don’t want this to be an error:
</p>
<pre>
if (verbose) {
  format = "{0} is not {1} (because of {2})";
} else {
  format = "{0} not {1}";
}
String.Format(format, "Zero", "One", "Two");
</pre>
<p>
Think of the format string as a <code>SELECT</code> clause
from the dataset provided by the remaining parameters.
If your table has fields <code>ID</code> and <code>NAME</code>
and you select just the <code>ID</code>, there’s nothing wrong
with that.
But if you ask for <code>DATE</code>, then you have an error.</p>
