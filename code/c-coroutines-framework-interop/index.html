<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">C++ coroutines: Framework interop</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/code/c-coroutines-constructible-awaitable-or-function-returning-awaitable"> So far</a>, we’ve been looking at the basics of awaitable objects. Even though we barely know anything beyond <code>await_</code><code>suspend</code>, we already know enough to allow us to start diving deeper.</p>
<p>It is frequently the case that you need your awaiter to interact with something outside the C++ standard library. To make it easier to integrate coroutines with existing frameworks, the <code>coroutine_handle</code> can be converted to a <code>void*</code> by calling its <code>address()</code> method, and the resulting <code>void*</code> can be converted back to an equivalent <code>coroutine_handle</code> by calling <code>from_</code><code>address()</code>.¹</p>
<p>Most frameworks let you pass a pointer-sized piece of data around to help remember state, and being able to convert a handle into a pointer (and back) lets you pass the coroutine handle through such state parameters. Otherwise, you’d have to copy the <code>coroutine_handle</code> to the heap and pass the address of the heap block, and then keep track of when to free the heap block.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate this by reimplementing <code>resume_</code><code>new_</code><code>thread</code> in terms of Win32 functions instead of the <code>std::</code><code>thread</code> standard library class.</p>
<pre>struct resume_new_thread : std::experimental::suspend_always
{
  void await_suspend(
      std::experimental::coroutine_handle&lt;&gt; handle)
  {
    HANDLE thread = CreateThread(nullptr, 0, callback,
                        handle.address(), 0, &amp;threadId);
    if (!thread) throw some_kind_of_error();
    CloseHandle(thread);
  }

  DWORD CALLBACK callback(void* parameter)
  {
    auto handle = std::experimental::coroutine_handle&lt;&gt;::
                    from_address(parameter);
    handle();
    return 0;
  }
};
</pre>
<p>The basic idea is the same as last time: When the coroutine suspends, schedule the continuation on a newly-created thread.</p>
<p>The <code>Create­Thread</code> function allows you to pass a single pointer-sized piece of data, so we convert our handle to a <code>void*</code> by calling the <code>address</code> method, and pass that pointer as the reference data to the thread procedure. The thread procedure converts the pointer back into a coroutine handle by calling <code>from_</code><code>address</code>, and then invokes the coroutine to resume execution.</p>
<p>If terseness is your game, you could inline the thread procedure as a stateless lambda, taking advantage of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150220-00/?p=44623"> the implicit conversion from a stateless lambda to a function pointer</a>.</p>
<pre>struct resume_new_thread : std::experimental::suspend_always
{
  void await_suspend(
      std::experimental::coroutine_handle&lt;&gt; handle)
  {
    HANDLE thread = CreateThread(nullptr, 0,
      [](void* parameter) -&gt; DWORD
      {
        std::experimental::coroutine_handle&lt;&gt;::
                    from_address(parameter)();
        return 0;
      }, handle.address(), 0, &amp;threadId);
    if (!thread) throw some_kind_of_error();
    CloseHandle(thread);
  }
};
</pre>
<p>Next time, we’ll use what we’ve learned about awaiters to develop a way to override C++/WinRT coroutine threading defaults.</p>
<p>¹ The method names <code>address</code> and <code>from_</code><code>address</code> give a strong clue as to what the <code>void*</code> represents: it’s the address of runtime-managed coroutine state, known in the language specification as a <i>coroutine frame</i>.</p>
