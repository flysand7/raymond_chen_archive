<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Crash course in async and await</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m going to assume that you know how the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords work. If you need a refresher, you can <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/tag/async/">read Eric Lippert’s extensive exposition of the subject</a>. Here’s the short version. <b>People who know how <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> work can go take a nap.</b> </p>
<p>When you write a function that is marked <code>async</code>, then the function is broken up into a series of mini-functions at each <code>await</code> call. The code executes synchronously up until the first <code>await</code>, at which point the rest of the code is scheduled for resumption when the awaited thing produces a result. Optionally, a task is returned so that the caller can schedule its own continuation when the async function executes its <code>return</code> statement. </p>
<p>For example, let’s take this function: </p>
<pre>
async Task&lt;int&gt; GetTotalAsync()
{
  int total = GetStartValue();
  int increment = await GetIncrementAsync();
  return total + increment;
}
</pre>
<p>This is shorthand for the following, with error checking has been elided for expository simplicity. </p>
<pre>
Task&lt;int&gt; GetTotalAsync()
{
  int total = GetStartValue();
  return GetIncrementAsync().ContinueWith((incrementTask) =&gt; {
    int increment = incrementTask.Result;
    return total + increment;
  });
}
</pre>
<p>(Actually, that’s not really what happens; <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh456403.aspx">here are the gory details</a>.) </p>
<p>The point is that the function executes normally until it encounters the first <code>await</code>, at which point it schedules itself as a continuation of the thing being awaited, and returns a new task that represents the continuation. When the thing being awaited completes, execution resumes with the continuation. That continuation might do some work, and then perform another <code>await</code>, which once again schedules itself as a continuation of the thing being awaited. Eventually, the original function runs to completion, at which point the chain of tasks terminates with a result, namely the thing that the original function returned. </p>
<p>Note that when dealing with <code>async</code> functions, you have to distinguish with what the function <i>returns</i> and what it <i>produces</i> as a <i>result</i> when it <i>completes</i>. The <i>return value</i> is the thing that is returned synchronously by the function, typically a task of some sort. When execution reaches the end of the task chain, the task is said to have <i>completed</i>. The thing that comes out the end is called the <i>result</i>. </p>
<p>In other words, there are two ways to call an <code>async</code> function. </p>
<pre>
var task = SomethingAsync();
var result = await SomethingAsync();
</pre>
<p>If you call it without <code>await</code> then you get the raw task back. If you call it with <code>await</code>, then when the task completes, you get the result. </p>
<p><b>People who know how <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> work can start waking up now.</b> You still know the stuff coming up next, but at least you’ll be primed for the discussion to come after. </p>
<p>There are three ways of writing an <code>async</code> function: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>async Task&lt;T&gt; SomethingAsync() { ... return t; }</code>
<li><code>async Task SomethingAsync() { ... }</code>
<li><code>async void SomethingAsync() { ... }</code> </li></li></li></ul>
<p>In all the cases, the function is transformed into a chain of tasks. The difference is what the function returns. </p>
<p>In the first case, the function returns a task that eventually produces the <code>t</code>. </p>
<p>In the second case, the function returns a task which has no product, but you can still <code>await</code> on it to know when it has run to completion. </p>
<p>The third case is the nasty one. The third case is like the second case, except that <i>you don’t even get the task back</i>. You have no way of knowing when the function’s task has completed. </p>
<p>The <code>async void</code> case is a “fire and forget”: You start the task chain, but you don’t care about when it’s finished. When the function returns, all you know is that everything up to the first <code>await</code> has executed. Everything after the first <code>await</code> will run at some unspecified point in the future that you have no access to. </p>
<p>Now that I’ve set up the story, we’ll dig into the consequences next time. </p>
