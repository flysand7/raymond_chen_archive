<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Stupid JavaScript debugging tricks: Abusing the conditional breakpoint</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Your favorite JavaScript debugger may very well have a conditional breakpoint facility, and if it does, you can abuse it to do things unrelated to conditional breakpoints. </p>
<p>Since conditional breakpoints are based on evaluating an expression, you can use an expression with side effects, like, say, logging. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border: solid 3px #ebebeb;font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;width: 30em;color: black;background-color: #f0f0f0">
<tr>
<td align="center" style="background-color: white;padding: 5px">Breakpoint Condition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 1px #dadada;padding: 10px">
<p>When the breakpoint location is reached,     the expression is evaluated and the breakpoint     is hit only if the expression is true or has changed.     </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td>☒</td>
<td>Condition:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray;background-color: white;width: 30em">    console.log(“click received”)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>ⵙ Is true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>ⵔ Has changed</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" style="text-align: center">
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 2px black;width: 9em">OK</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px black;width: 9em">Cancel</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p></td>
</tr>

<p>The <code>console.log</code> function returns <code>undefined</code>, so the condition is never true, but that’s okay, because we’re executing the expression for its side effect of printing a string to the console. </p>
<p>Here, we just logged a hard-coded string, but you can log any expression you want. For example, you could use </p>
<pre>
console.log("current selection is " + this.currentSelection)
</pre>
<p>Or even more fun: </p>
<pre>
console.log(getStack())
</pre>
<p>where you’ve defined </p>
<pre>
function getStack() { try { throw new Error(); } catch (e) { return e.stack; } }
</pre>
<p>What, you didn’t define that function? No problem. Just evaluate it in your immediate window and boom, now it’s defined. </p>
<p>Now, printing an entire stack trace may be excessive. So store it in your object for future inspection. For example, you might do this in a constructor so that you have a stack trace of how your object got created. That way, when you have a transaction that failed to complete, you can look at the cached stack trace to see how the transaction got started. </p>
<pre>
(this._stack = getStack()) === 42
</pre>
<p>The extra <code>=== 42</code> at the end is to ensure that the value of the expression is falsy. </p>
<p>Anyway, just a few quick tips for JavaScript debugging. I didn’t come up with these ideas, but I’m sharing them. </p>
