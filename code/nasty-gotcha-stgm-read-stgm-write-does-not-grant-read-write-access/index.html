<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nasty gotcha: STGM_READ | STGM_WRITE does not grant read/write access</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You might think that if you want to get read/write access, you could pass <code>STGM_READ | STGM_WRITE</code>. You would be wrong. You have to pass <code>STGM_READ­WRITE</code>.
 The three flags <code>STGM_READ</code>, <code>STGM_WRITE</code>, and <code>STGM_READ­WRITE</code> are mutually exclusive. If you try to combine them, you get a weird mess.
 In particular, since the numerical value of <code>STGM_READ</code> is zero, passing <code>STGM_READ | STGM_WRITE</code> is numerically equivalent to passing <code>STGM_WRITE</code>, which grants write-only access.
 The documentation for the <code>STGM_*</code> constants specifically says “<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380337(v=vs.85).aspx">It is not valid to use more than one element from a single group</a>,” and <code>STGM_READ</code> and <code>STGM_WRITE</code> belong to the Access group (as does <code>STGM_READ­WRITE</code>).
 These values date back to the days of MS-DOS, where function 3Dh (Open File) passed an access mode in the AL register.</p>

<p> The bottom three bits specified the requested access (0 = read-only, 1 = write-only, 2 = read/write), and the remaining bits were reserved.
 Later, when networking support was added in approximately MS-DOS 3.5, three more bits were pressed into service:</p>

<th>1</th>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td colspan="3">share<br/>mode</td>
<td>0</td>
<td colspan="3">access<br/>mode</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Sharing modes were 0 = compatibility mode, 1 = deny all, 2 = deny write, 3 = deny read, 4 = deny none.</p>
<p> These values were carried forward into Windows as flags to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365430(v=vs.85).aspx"> <code>Open­File</code> function</a>: </p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse">

<p> These flags were then carried forward into the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380337(v=vs.85).aspx"> STGM constants</a> with the same numerical values. </p>
