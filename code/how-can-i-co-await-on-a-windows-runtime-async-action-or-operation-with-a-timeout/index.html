<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I <code>co_await</code> on a Windows Runtime async action or operation with a timeout?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Say you want to <code>co_await</code> on an <code>IAsyncOperation</code> but also want to abandon the await if it takes too long.</p>
<pre>auto widgetOperation = GetWidgetAsync();
if (winrt::wait_for(widgetOperation, 15s) == AsyncStatus::Started)
{
    // timed out
    widgetOperation.Cancel(); // abandon the operation
} else {
    // will throw if operation failed or was cancelled
    auto widget = widgetOperation.GetResults();
}
</pre>
<p>The downside of this approach is that it blocks the thread for 15 seconds. This is bad enough for a background thread, since you are holding a thread hostage for the duration, but it’s really bad for a UI thread, since it makes your UI hang.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use <code>when_any</code> which creates a new <code>IAsyncXxx</code> that completes when any of its parameters completes. The first parameter is the <code>widgetOperation</code>, and the second is a coroutine that returns the same type of operation, but completes after a set timeout.</p>
<pre>auto widgetOperation = GetWidgetAsync();
auto widgetTimeout = [] -&gt; IAsyncOperation&lt;Widget&gt;
    {
        co_await winrt::resume_after(15s);
        co_return nullptr;
    }();
auto widget = co_await winrt::when_any(widgetOperation, widgetTimeout);

widgetOperation.Cancel();
widgetTimeout.Cancel();

if (!widget) {
    // timed out or GetWidgetAsync() returned nullptr
} else {
    // GetWidgetAsync() produced a widget
}
</pre>
<p>We create two <code>IAsyncOperation&lt;Widget&gt;</code>s. One is the operation we care about (<code>GetWidgetAsync()</code>) and the other is an operation that waits 15 seconds, and then completes with <code>nullptr</code>.</p>
<p>We then use <code>winrt::<wbr/>when_any</code> to await until anything completes. Once anything completes, we cancel everything. This has no effect on asynchronous operations that are completed, but it tells the still-incomplete operations to abandon their work if they can. Cancelling everything isn’t technically necessary, but it does avoid doing extra work that is going to be ignored anyway.</p>
<p>After all the tidying is done, we see if we actually got something. If the <code>Get­Widget­Async()</code> is taking too long, then the winning operation will be the <code>widgetTimeout</code>, and it completes with <code>nullptr</code>. If the <code>Get­Widget­Async()</code> finishes in under 15 seconds, then it will be the winning operation, and the result will be the thing it produced. That thing it produced could have been <code>nullptr</code>, so you can’t distinguish it from a timeout, but the idea here is that you picked the <code>co_return</code> at the end of the <code>widgetTimeout</code> lambda so that <code>nullptr</code> corresponds to what you would have wanted to do in the case of a timeout.</p>
<p>If you really need to distinguish between completing with <code>nullptr</code> and timing out, you could add an explicit flag.</p>
<pre><span style="color: blue;">auto timedOut = std::make_shared&lt;bool&gt;();</span>
auto widgetOperation = GetWidgetAsync();
auto widgetTimeout = []<span style="color: blue;">(auto timedOut)</span> -&gt; IAsyncOperation&lt;Widget&gt;
    {
        co_await winrt::resume_after(15s);
        <span style="color: blue;">*timedOut = true;</span>
        co_return nullptr;
    }(timedOut);
auto widget = co_await winrt::when_any(widgetOperation, widgetTimeout);

widgetOperation.Cancel();
widgetTimeout.Cancel();

if (*timedOut) {
    // timed out
} else {
    // GetWidgetAsync() produced something (possibly nullptr)
}
</pre>
<p>Or, perhaps more sneakily, you can check the status of the <code>widgetTimeout</code> operation.</p>
<pre>auto widgetOperation = GetWidgetAsync();
auto widgetTimeout = [] -&gt; IAsyncOperation&lt;Widget&gt;
    {
        co_await winrt::resume_after(15s);
        co_return nullptr;
    }();
auto widget = co_await winrt::when_any(widgetOperation, widgetTimeout);
<span style="color: blue;">auto timedOut = widgetTimeout.Status() == AsyncStatus::Completed;</span>

widgetOperation.Cancel();
widgetTimeout.Cancel();

if (<span style="color: blue;">timedOut</span>) {
    // timed out
} else {
    // GetWidgetAsync() produced something (possibly nullptr)
}
</pre>
<p>We’ll expand upon this pattern in a few weeks, so stay tuned. (Or “tune out”, if that’s more to your liking.)</p>
