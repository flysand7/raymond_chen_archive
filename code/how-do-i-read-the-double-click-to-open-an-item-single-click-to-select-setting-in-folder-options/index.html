<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I read the "Double-click to open an item (single-click to select)" setting in Folder Options?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program reports whether the
<i>Double-click to open an item (single-click to select)</i>
option is selected in the <i>Folder Options</i> dialog.
A customer wanted to know how to do this,
presumably so that their program
would respect the setting and adjust its user interface
to match.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
BOOL IsDoubleClickToOpenEnabled()
{
 SHELLFLAGSTATE sfs;
 SHGetSettings(&amp;sfs, SSF_DOUBLECLICKINWEBVIEW);
 return sfs.fDoubleClickInWebView;
}
int __cdecl main(int, char**)
{
 printf("Double-click is %s\n",
        IsDoubleClickToOpenEnabled() ? "enabled" : "disabled");
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The flag and member name is kind of weird.
The ability to single-click to open an item was
introduced as part of the Windows Desktop Update
which came with Internet Explorer 4.
This update made Explorer more Web-like,
with single-click to activate and underlines appearing
on hover.
(This was back in the day when making everything more
Web-like was the new hotness.)
</p>
<p>
The internal name of this Explorer feature was <i>WebView</i>,
and that name is reflected in the flag and structure.</p>
