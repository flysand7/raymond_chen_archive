<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why am I getting a weird error about <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code> when I try to write a coroutine?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was following <a href="https://kennykerr.ca/2018/03/09/cppwinrt-producing-async-objects/"> a tutorial by Kenny Kerr</a> and tried to create the world’s simplest coroutine:</p>
<pre>using namespace winrt::Windows::Foundation;

IAsyncAction Dummy()
{
    co_return;
}
</pre>
<p>This resulted in an error:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">// MSVC
error C2039: 'promise_<wbr>type': is not a member of 'std::<wbr/>experimental::<wbr/>coroutine_traits&lt;<wbr/>winrt::<wbr/>Windows::<wbr/>Foundation::<wbr/>IAsyncAction&gt;'

// gcc
error: unable to find the promise type for this coroutine

// clang
this function cannot be a coroutine: 'std::<wbr/>experimental::<wbr/>coroutine_traits&lt;<wbr/>winrt::<wbr/>Windows::<wbr/>Foundation::<wbr/>IAsyncAction&gt;' has no member named 'promise_<wbr/>type'
</wbr></pre>
<p>What is this error trying to say?</p>
<p>Recall that one of the steps in the coroutine transformation is taking the formal return type of the coroutine function, combining it with the formal parameters, and looking up a corresponding specialization of the <code>coroutine_<wbr/>traits</code> type, specifically to find a nested type name <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code>.</p>
<p>If no such specialization exists, then the lookup for <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code> fails.</p>
<p>And that’s what the error message is complaining about. The error message is wearing compiler-colored glasses.</p>
<p>To be fair, it’s not like the error message is intentionally being obtuse. What’s happening is that the compiler front-end performs the coroutine transformation, and then the result goes through the type resolver, and it’s the type resolver that can’t find a <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code>. The type resolver doesn’t know that the request for <code>promise_<wbr/>type</code> was the result of a coroutine transformation. It just reports it as a failed type lookup in the coroutine traits type.</p>
<p>It looks like gcc goes the extra mile and passes some information to the type resolver that “This type is coming from a coroutine transformation”, so that it can generate a coroutine-specific error message.</p>
<p>Okay, so now that we understand what the error message means, how do we fix it?</p>
<p>To fix it, you need to provide the appropriate specialization of the <code>coroutine_<wbr/>traits</code> type. In the case of C++/WinRT, you get it by doing a</p>
<pre>#include &lt;winrt/Windows.Foundation.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>This is consistent with the overall C++/WinRT rules that you <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190529-00/?p=102527"> must include the header file for any namespace you use</a>.</p>
