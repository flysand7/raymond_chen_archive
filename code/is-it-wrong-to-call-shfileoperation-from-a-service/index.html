<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is it wrong to call SHFileOperation from a service?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A customer had a simple question: “Is it wrong to call <code>SHFile­Operation</code> from a service?” </p>
<p> I don’t know if I’d call it wrong, but I’d call it highly inadvisable. </p>
<ul>
<li> <code>SHFile­Operation</code> was designed for interactive operations,     so you’re using it outside its original design parameters. </li>
<li>     Many shell extensions ignore “no UI” flags and put up UI anyway.     As a result, your call to <code>SHFile­Operation</code>     may end up getting stuck on unexpected UI.     Now you have a service displaying UI,     and that’s just     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2005/09/14/466175.aspx">     asking for trouble</a>. </li>
<li>     The shell for the most part     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/28/10217445.aspx">     does not expect to be called while impersonating</a>.     There are a few functions specifically designed for use     while impersonating;     those exceptions are called out explicitly     in their respective documentation.     <code>SHFile­Operation</code> is not one of those functions. </li>
<li>     Since <code>SHFile­Operation</code> uses the shell namespace,     you are at risk of loading shell extensions into a service.     Shell extensions typically are not written with the     strict security requirements of a service in mind,     and you may end up creating a security hole.     Somebody could plant a     <code>desktop.ini</code> into a directory your service operates on,     and now your service has been tricked into loading     a shell namespace extension.     The bad guys are constantly searching for     buggy shell extensions that they     can use as an attack point.     And if they can get into a service, well, then     they just hit the jackpot! </li>
</ul>
