Just because you have
<a href="http://www.prepressure.com/library/binhex.htm">
the ASCII table</a> memorized
doesn’t mean you know how sorting works.
</p>
<p>
I remember a bug filed where somebody said that the “sort”
command was sorting underscores incorrectly:
</p>
<pre>
AAA__
AAAAA
</pre>
<p>
this was claimed to be wrong “because underscore character
follow uppercase letters and precedes lowercase letters”.
</p>
<p>
Well perhaps it does if you think ASCII sorting is the way
sorting should be.
</p>
<p>
ASCII sorting is so last century.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/strings/stringreference/stringfunctions/comparestring.asp">
CompareString function</a>
describes two types of sorting, “word sort” and “string sort”.
And both of them sort punctuation before letters.</p>
