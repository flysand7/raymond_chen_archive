<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Try to avoid having BOOL function parameters</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Generally speaking, I believe that you should try to avoid giving functions a boolean parameter (<code>BOOL</code>, <code>bool</code>, etc.) unless the meaning of that boolean parameter is blatantly obvious. Examples of obvious meaning would be the second parameter to the <code>EnableWindow</code> function (<code>TRUE</code> obviously means the window is being enabled and <code>FALSE</code> means that it’s being disabled) and the final parameter to <code>ShowScrollBar</code> (<code>TRUE</code> obviously means the scroll bar is being shown and <code>FALSE</code> means that it’s being hidden). In both of these cases, the meaning of the boolean parameter is encoded in the name of the function itself.
 But for functions like <code>CreateEvent</code>, what does that first <code>BOOL</code> parameter mean? First, you have to realize that the first <code>BOOL</code> parameter controls whether you get an auto-reset event or a manual-reset one. Does <code>FALSE</code> create a manual-reset event? Or is that done by passing <code>TRUE</code>? I can never remember and I have to go looking it up each time. That first parameter should have been declared as, say, a <code>DWORD</code> or, even better, an <code>enum</code> with two legal values, <code>EVENTTYPE_AUTORESET</code> and <code>EVENTTYPE_MANUALRESET</code>.
 Even worse is that <code>CreateEvent</code> has <strong>two</strong> <code>BOOL</code> parameters. Like anybody reading the code later can remember which comes first.
 And the mystery <code>bool</code>s keep coming. Consider, for example, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemiostreamreaderclassctortopic3.asp"> <code>StreamReader(Stream, bool)</code></a>. What does <code>true</code> mean? Or <code>false</code>? Heck if I know.</p>
<p> Mind you, this is just my opinion. Others may disagree with me. </p>
