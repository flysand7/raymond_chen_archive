<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A question about how to detect whether Windows Update needs the system to be restarted turns out to be the wrong question</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know whether there was a way to detect that Windows Update has recently installed an update that requires a reboot. They explained that their computers are running dedicated software, and the customers are not technically-savvy, so they want to display the “You need to reboot” message more prominently, and let the user choose the best time to reboot. “We have been checking a variety of registry keys, and we have found that the set of keys to check is quite extensive and varies depending on the nature of the update that was installed.” </p>
<p>There is a fairly straightforward way to check <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/09/21/10642727.aspx">whether Windows Update is waiting for the system to reboot</a>, but we asked for more information about the customer’s scenario. Fortunately, the customer was willing to share. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>These computers are in a hospital running critical medical software. The software runs 24/7 and must not reboot without user consent. </p></blockquote>
<p>If these are critical machines, then asking whether Windows Update is requesting a reboot is the wrong question. By the time you get the answer “Yes”, you are already in trouble: If you reboot the computer as soon as a reboot is required, you interrupt the machine’s critical functioning. If you postpone the reboot, then you leave the computer in a nonstandard configuration wherein an update is partially-installed, and that nonstandard configuration may compromise the machine’s critical function. </p>
<p>In this specific case, the idea would be to change the design from “Install the update, and then postpone the reboot until a convenient time” to “Wait for a convenient time, then install the update and reboot immediately.” Here’s a sketch of how it could work. (Note: This is a sketch, not a fully-analyzed scenario. Do not implement this design on your critical medical systems before independently validating its efficacy to your satisfaction. In fact, as a general rule, you should not use blog posts as the sole basis for software design decisions for critical medical systems.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Set Automatic Updates so it does not install updates     immediately. Either disable it, or set it to     download updates without installing them. 
<li>Ensure that users do not have permission to alter these settings     or to initiate the installation of updates independently. 
<li>Periodically check whether there are new updates available.     The     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387102(v=vs.85).aspx">    Searching, Downloading, and Installing Updates</a>     script on MSDN is an example of how you can use the     Windows Update Agent API to answer questions like this. 
<li>If there are updates available that do not require a reboot,     you may choose to install them without interrupting service.     You can use the     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.updateservices.administration.installationbehavior.rebootbehavior%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"> <code>Installation­Behavior.Reboot­Behavior</code></a>     property     to determine whether a particular update     guarantees that it can be installed     without a reboot. 
<li>If there are updates available that may require a reboot,     inform the user that the computer will be unavailable while     the updates are installed and let the user choose when to install     those updates. 
<li>When installing the updates, display a message indicating that     the computer is unavailable. 
<li>When installation is complete, reboot immediately. </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>The important things are that (1) you treat the installation of the update and the reboot as a unit, and (2) you don’t start the install+reboot process until the user confirms that they are okay with the system being temporarily unavailable. </p>
