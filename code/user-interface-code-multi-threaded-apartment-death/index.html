<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">User interface code + multi-threaded apartment = death</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There are single-threaded apartments and multi-threaded apartments. Well, first there were only single-threaded apartments. No wait, let’s try that again.</p>
<p>First, applications had only one thread. Remember, 16-bit Windows didn’t have threads. Each process had one of what we today call a thread, end of story. Compatibility with this ancient model still exists today, thanks to <a href="/history/the-dreaded-main-threading-model" title='the dreaded "main" threading model'> the dreaded “main” threading model</a>. The less said about that threading model the better.</p>
<p>OLE was developed back in the 16-bit days, so it used window messages to pass information between processes, there being no other inter-process communication mechanism available. When you initialized OLE, it created a secret <code>OleMainThreadWnd</code> window, and those secret windows were used to communicate between processes (and in Win32, threads). As we learned some time ago, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20051010-09/?p=33843" title="Thread affinity of user interface objects, part 1: Window handles"> window handles have thread affinity</a>, which means that these communication windows have thread affinity, which means that OLE has thread affinity. When you made a call to an object that belonged to another apartment, OLE posted a message to the owner thread’s secret <code>OleMainThreadWnd</code> window to tell it what needs to be done, and then it went into a private message loop waiting for the owner thread to do the work and post the results back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the OLE team realized that there were really two parts to what they were doing. There was the low-level object and interface management stuff (<code>IUnknown</code>, <code>CoMarshalInterThreadInterfaceInStream</code>) and the high-level “object linking and embedding” stuff (<code>IOleWindow</code>, <code>IOleDocument</code>) that was the impetus for the OLE effort in the first place. The low-level stuff got broken out into a functional layer known as COM; the high-level stuff kept the name OLE.</p>
<p>Breaking the low-level and high-level stuff apart allowed the low-level stuff to be used by non-GUI programs, which for quite some time were eyeing that object management functionality with some jealousy. As a result, COM grew two personalities, one focused on the GUI customers and another focused on the non-GUI customers. For the non-GUI customers, additional functionality such as multi-threaded apartments were added, and since the customers didn’t do GUI stuff, multi-threaded apartments weren’t burdened by the GUI rules. They didn’t post messages to communicate with each other; they used kernel objects and <code>WaitForSingleObject</code>. Everybody wins, right?</p>
<p>Well, yes, everybody wins, but you have to know what side your bread is buttered on. If you initialize a GUI thread as a multi-threaded apartment, you have violated the assumptions under which multi-threaded apartments were invented! Multi-threaded apartments assume that they are not running on GUI threads since they don’t pump messages; they just use <code>WaitForSingleObject</code>. This not only clogs up broadcasts, but it can also deadlock your program. The thread that owns the object might try to send a message to your thread, but your thread can’t receive the message since it isn’t pumping messages.</p>
<p>That’s why COM objects involved with user interface programming nearly always <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041213-00/?p=37043" title="Why do I get E_NOINTERFACE when creating an object that supports that interface?"> require a single-threaded apartment</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060902130739/http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/06/275659.aspx#276270"> why <code>OleInitialize</code> initializes a single-threaded apartment</a>. Because multi-threaded apartments were designed on the assumption that there was no user interface. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060902130739/http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/06/275659.aspx#277587"> Once you’re doing user interface work, you have to use a single-threaded apartment</a>.</p>
