<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My, those threads start up really fast nowadays</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Here’s a little puzzle
inspired by an actual bug:
</p>
<pre>
// global variable
DWORD g_WorkerThreadId;
bool IsRunningOnWorkerThread()
{
  return GetCurrentThreadId() == g_WorkerThreadId;
}
bool LaunchWorkerThread()
{
 HANDLE hThread = CreateThread(nullptr, 0,
                               WorkerThread,
                               nullptr, 0,
                               &amp;g_WorkerThreadId);
 if (hThread != nullptr) {
   CloseHandle(hThread);
   return true;
 }
 return false;
}
DWORD CALLBACK WorkerThread(void *Proc)
{
  // Can this assertion ever fire?
  assert(IsRunningOnWorkerThread());
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Can the assertion at the start of <code>WorkerThread</code>
ever fire?
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the answer is <i>Yes</i>,
otherwise it wouldn’t be a very interesting article.
</p>
<p>
The assertion can fire if the worker thread starts running
<i>before the call the <code>Create­Thread</code> returns</i>.
In that case, the caller hasn’t yet received the
handle or ID of the newly-started thread.
The new thread calls
<code>Is­Running­On­Worker­Thread</code>,
which returns <code>false</code> since
<code>g_Worker­Thread­Id</code> hasn’t been initialized yet.
</p>
<p>
The actual bug was something along the lines of this:
</p>
<pre>
void DoSomething()
{
  if (IsRunningOnWorkerThread()) {
     .. do it one way ..
  } else {
     .. do it the other way ..
  }
}
void DoManyThings()
{
  DoSomething();
  DoSomethingElse();
  DoYetAnotherThing();
}
DWORD CALLBACK WorkerThread(void *Proc)
{
  ...
  DoManyThings();
  ...
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
If the new thread started up so quickly that the original thread
doesn’t get a chance to receive the new thread ID and put
it into
<code>g_Worker­Thread­ID</code>,
then the <code>Do­Something</code> function
called from the worker thread will accidentally do things
the not-on-the-worker-thread way,
and then things start go go awry.
</p>
<p>
One way to address is is to add suspenders to your belt:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CALLBACK WorkerThread(void *Proc)
{
  g_WorkerThreadId = GetCurrentThreadId();
  ...
</pre>
<p>
By having both the original thread and the created thread
set the <code>g_WorkerThreadId</code> variable,
you cover both cases of the race.
If the original thread runs faster, then the
<code>CreateThread</code> function will set the
<code>g_WorkerThreadId</code> variable to the ID of the worker
thread,
and the first line of <code>Worker­Thread</code>
will be redundant.
On the other hand, if the worker thread runs faster,
then the assignment at the beginning of
<code>Worker­Thread</code> sets the thread ID,
and the assignment performed by
the <code>CreateThread</code> function will be redundant.</p>
