<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How you might be loading a DLL during DLL_PROCESS_DETACH without even realizing it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
As you are I’m sure aware,
you shouldn’t be doing much of anything in your <code>DllMain</code>
function,
but you have to watch out for cases where you end up doing them
accidentally.
</p>
<p>
Some time ago, I was investigating a failure which was traced back
to loading a DLL inside <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>.
Wait, what kind of insane person <i>loads</i> a DLL as part of
shutting down?
Shouldn’t you be cleaning up stuff, not creating new stuff?
</p>
<p>
The following is not the actual code, but it captures the same
spirit:
</p>
<pre>
INFO *CachedInfo;
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD dwReason, void *pvReserved)
{
  switch (dwReason) {
  ...
  case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
    ...
    CoTaskMemFree(CachedInfo);
    ...
  }
  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
There is some global variable that contains a pointer to memory
that was allocated by <code>CoTaskMemAlloc</code>.
In this case, I made it a cache, but the details aren’t important.
When the DLL is detached from the process, we free the cached memory
so we don’t have a leak.
Since it is okay to pass <code>NULL</code> to
the <code>CoTaskMemFree</code> function (it simply returns
without doing anything),
the cleanup code works even if we never called a function that
put a value into the cache.
</p>
<p>
Except that this code ended up loading a DLL.
The reason is delay-loading.
</p>
<p>
The authors of this DLL sped up its load time by marking
<code>OLEAUT32.DLL</code> as a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/yx9zd12s.aspx">
delay-loaded DLL</a>,
which means that it doesn’t get loaded until somebody calls a
function in it.
</p>
<p>
And in fact, nobody called a function from <code>OLEAUT32</code>.
Ever.
</p>
<p>
“Hooray!” you shout.
“We avoided loading <code>OLEAUT32</code> altogether.”
After all, the fastest code is code that doesn’t run.
</p>
<p>
Except that it does run.
Right there.
In your <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> handler.
</p>
<p>
Since nobody called a function from <code>OLEAUT32</code>,
the call to <code>CoTaskMemFree</code> was the first call to
<code>OLEAUT32</code> and therefore
<i>caused it to be loaded</i>.
From inside a <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> handler.
</p>
<p>
Delay-loading is one of those features that is very convenient
and saves you a lot of typing (namely, writing those stub functions
yourself),
but you also have to understand what’s going on so you don’t
use it incorrectly.
(In this case, a superficially-redundant
<code>if (CachedInfo != NULL)</code> test needs to be inserted.)</p>
