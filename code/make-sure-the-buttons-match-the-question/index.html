<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Make sure the buttons match the question</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         When your program displays a dialog box with buttons, please make the buttons match         the text. Consider this dialog, which appears after you install patches from Windows         Update:      </p>

<p>         It asks a yes/no question, but the options are “OK” and “Cancel”. Either the buttons         should be changed to “Yes” and “No”, or the text of the message should be changed         to match the OK/Cancel buttons. In the latter case, the text could go something like,         “Windows Update will restart your computer. If you want to restart later, or close         other programs first, click Cancel, and then restart your computer manually.”      </p>
