<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">We've traced the call and it's coming from inside the house: Operating system names</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
As the Windows Server 2003 project wound down,
somebody reported a serious bug that went something like this:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
<b>Subject</b>: Windows Server 2003 still refers to itself as Windows .NET Server
</p>
<p>
Previous versions of Windows report the product name correctly,
but Windows Server 2003 still calls itself “Windows .NET Server”
instead of Windows Server 2003.
</p>
<pre>
// on Windows XP
C:\&gt; osver
Windows XP
// on Windows 2000
C:\&gt; osver
Windows 2000 Professional
// on Windows 2000 Server
C:\&gt; osver
Windows 2000 Server
// on Windows NT 4 SP3
C:\&gt; osver
Windows NT 4 SP3 Workstation
// but on Windows Server 2003
C:\&gt; osver
Windows .NET Server
</pre>
<p>
I’ve attached a copy of the <code>osver</code> program
you can use to reproduce the problem.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, if you run the <code>osver</code> program attached to the
bug report, it does report <code>Windows .NET Server</code> when
run on Windows Server 2003.
Now to find out where
<code>osver</code> gets the product name from,
so we can find and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The customer was kind enough to include the source code to the
<code>osver</code> program, and we found some code in that program
that gave away the root of the problem:
</p>
<pre>
...
if (osv.dwMajorVersion == 5 &amp;&amp;
    osv.dwMinorVersion == 2) {
 printf("Windows .NET Server\n");
}
...
</pre>
<p>
When we pointed this out to the bug submitter,
we received a simple but gracious reply:
</p>
<p>
“Oops. Sorry about that.”</p>
