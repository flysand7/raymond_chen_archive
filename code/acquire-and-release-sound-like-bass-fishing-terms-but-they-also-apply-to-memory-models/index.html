<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Acquire and release sound like bass fishing terms, but they also apply to memory models</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Many of the normal interlocked operations
come with variants called
<code>InterlockedXxxAcquire</code> and <code>InterlockedXxxRelease</code>.
What do the terms <code>Acquire</code> and
<code>Release</code> mean here?
</p>
<p>
They have to do with the memory model and how aggressively
the CPU can reorder operations around it.
</p>
<p>
An operation with <i>acquire</i> semantics is one which does not
permit subsequent memory operations to be advanced before it.
Conversely,
an operation with <i>release</i> semantics is one which does not
permit preceding memory operations to be delayed past it.
(This is pretty much the same thing that
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa490209.aspx">
MSDN says on the subject of Acquire and Release Semantics</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
int adjustment = CalculateAdjustment();
while (InterlockedCompareExchangeAcquire(&amp;lock, 1, 0) != 0)
  { /* spin lock */ }
for (Node *node = ListHead; node; node = node-&gt;Next)
   node-&gt;value += adjustment;
InterlockedExchangeRelease(&amp;lock, 0);
</pre>
<p>
Applying <i>Acquire</i> semantics to the first operation
operation ensures that the operations on the linked list
are performed
only after the <code>lock</code> variable
has been updated.
This is obviously desired here, since the purpose of the
updating the <code>lock</code> variable is ensure that
no other threads are updating the list while we’re walking it.
Only after we have successfully set the lock to 1
is it safe to read from <code>ListHead</code>.
On the other hand,
the <i>Acquire</i> operation imposes no constraints upon when
the store to the <code>adjustment</code> variable can be
completed to memory.
(Of course, there may very well be
other constraints on the <code>adjustment</code>
variable,
but the Acquire does not add any new constraints.)
</p>
<p>
Conversely, <i>Release</i> semantics for an interlocked
operation prevent pending memory operations from being delayed
past the operation.
In our example, this means that the stores to
<code>node-&gt;value</code> must all complete
before the interlocked variable’s value changes
back to zero.
This is also desired, because the purpose of the lock
is to control access to the linked list.
If we had completed the stores after the lock was released,
then somebody else could have snuck in, taken the lock,
and, say, deleted an entry from the linked list.
And then when our pending writes completed, they would end up
writing to memory that has been freed. Oops.
</p>
<p>
The easy way to remember the difference between <i>Acquire</i>
and <i>Release</i>
is that <i>Acquire</i> is typically used when you are acquiring a resource
(in this case, taking a lock),
whereas
<i>Release</i> is typically used when you are releasing the resource.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa490209.aspx">
the MSDN article on acquire and release semantics</a> already notes,
the plain versions of the interlocked functions impose both acquire
and release semantics.
