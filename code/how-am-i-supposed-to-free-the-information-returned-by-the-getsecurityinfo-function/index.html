<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How am I supposed to free the information returned by the GetSecurityInfo function?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa446654.aspx">
The <code>Get­Security­Info</code> function</a>
returns a copy of the security descriptor for a kernel object,
along with pointers to specific portions you request.
More than once, a customer has been confused by the
guidelines for how to manage the memory returned by the function.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at what the function says:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<dl>
<dt><i>ppsidOwner</i> [out, optional]
<dd>A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the owner SID
    in the security descriptor returned in
    <i>ppSecurity­Descriptor</i>.
    The returned pointer is valid only if you set the
    <code>OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION</code>
    flag.
    This parameter can be NULL if you do not need the owner SID.
</dd></dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similar verbiage can be found for the other subcomponent
parameters.
The final parameter is described as
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<dl>
<dt><i>ppSecurity­Descriptor</i> [out, optional]
<dd>A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the security
    descriptor of the object.
    When you have finished using the pointer, free the returned
    buffer by calling the <b>Local­Free</b> function.
</dd></dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, so it’s clear that you need to free the security descriptor
with <code>Local­Free</code>.
But how do you free the owner, group, DACL, and SACL?
</p>
<p>
Read the documentation again.
I’ve underlined the important part.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<dl>
<dt><i>ppsidOwner</i> [out, optional]
<dd>A pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to the owner SID
    <u>in the security descriptor returned in
    <i>ppSecurity­Descriptor</i></u>.
    The returned pointer is valid only if you set the
    <code>OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION</code>
    flag.
    This parameter can be NULL if you do not need the owner SID.
</dd></dt></dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
In case that wasn’t clear, the point is reiterated in the remarks.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
If the <i>ppsidOwner</i>,
<i>ppsidGroup</i>,
<i>ppDacl</i>,
and
<i>ppSacl</i> parameters are non-NULL,
and the
<i>Security­Info</i> parameter specifies that they be retrieved
from the object,
those parameters will point to the corresponding parameters
in the security descriptor returned in
<i>ppSecurity­Descriptor</i>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In other words, you are getting a pointer
<i>into the security descriptor</i>.
No separate memory allocation is made.
The memory for the owner SID is freed when you free the security
descriptor.
It’s like the last parameter to <code>Get­Full­Path­Name</code>,
which receives a pointer to the file part of the full path.
There is no separate memory allocation for that pointer;
it’s just a pointer back into the main buffer.
</p>
<p>
You can think of the
<code>ppsidOwner</code> parameter
as a convenience parameter.
The <code>Get­Security­Info</code> function
offers to do the work of calling
<code>Get­Security­Descriptor­Owner</code>
for you.
You can think of the function as operating like this:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD WINAPI GetSecurityInfo(...)
{
    ... blah blah get the security info ...
    // Just out of courtesy:
    // Fetch the owner if the caller requested it
    if (ppsidOwner != NULL &amp;&amp;
        (SecurityInfo &amp; OWNER_SECURITY_INFO)) {
        BOOL fDefaulted;
        GetSecurityDescriptorOwner(pSecurityDescriptor,
                                   ppsidOwner,
                                   &amp;fDefaulted);
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
That’s why the documentation says that you need to pass
a non-null
<code>ppSecurity­Descriptor</code>
if you request any of the pieces of the security descriptor:
If you don’t, then you won’t be able to free the memory for it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
If the
<code>ppSecurity­Descriptor</code>
is so important,
why is it marked “optional”?
</p>
<p>
It really should be a mandatory parameter,
but older versions of Windows didn’t enforce the rule,
so the parameter is grandfathered in as optional,
even though no self-respecting program should ever
pass in <code>NULL</code>.
If you pass <code>NULL</code> for the
<code>ppSecurity­Descriptor</code>,
the function happily allocates the security descriptor
and then, “Oh wait, the caller didn’t give me a way to
receive the pointer to the security descriptor,
so I guess I won’t give it to him.”
</p>
<pre>
DWORD WINAPI GetSecurityInfo(...)
{
    ... blah blah get the security info ...
    if (ppSecurityDescriptor != NULL) {
        *ppSecurityDescriptor = pSecurityDescriptor;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Result: Memory leak.
</p>
<p>
You might say that the last parameter was designed by somebody
