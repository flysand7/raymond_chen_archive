<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Deleting elements from an JavaScript array and closing up the gaps</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program is an exercise that solves the following problem:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
Given a JavaScript array <code>a</code>
and an unsorted array <code>indices</code>
(possibly containing duplicates),
calculate the result of deleting all of the elements from the original
array as specified by the indices.
For example, suppose
<code>a = ["alice", "bob", "charles", "david", "eve"]</code>
and
<code>indices = [2, 4, 2, 0]</code>.
</p>
<table border="0">

<tr>
<td><code>a[0] </code></td>
<td><code>= "alice";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a[1] </code></td>
<td><code>= "bob";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a[2] </code></td>
<td><code>= "charles";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a[3] </code></td>
<td><code>= "david";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a[4] </code></td>
<td><code>= "eve";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.length</code></td>
<td><code>= 5;<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The indices specify that elements 2 (charles), 4 (eve),
2 (charles again, redundant), and 0 (alice) should be
deleted from the array,
leaving bob and david.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, if you had to delete only one element from the array,
it is pretty simple:
</p>
<pre>
a.splice(n, 1);
</pre>
<p>
The trick with removing multiple elements is
that deleting one element shifts the indices,
which can throw off future calculations.
One solution is to remove the highest-indexed element first;
in other words, operate on the indices in reverse sorted order.
</p>
<pre>
indices.sort().reverse().forEach(function(n) { a.splice(n, 1); });
</pre>
<p>
This technique does still suffer from the problem that if
there are duplicates in the indices,
extraneous elements get deleted by mistake.
</p>
<p>
Another approach is to reinterpret the problem by focusing not on
the deletion but on the survivors:
Produce the array consisting of elements whose indices are not
in the list of indices to be deleted.
</p>
<pre>
a = a.filter(function(e, i) { return indices.indexOf(i) &gt;= 0; });
</pre>
<p>
The above approach works well if the list of indices to be deleted
is short, but it gets quite expensive if the list is long.
</p>
<p>
My approach is to use the fact that JavaScript arrays can be sparse.
This is a side effect of the fact that JavaScript array indices
are actually object properties;
the only thing that makes arrays different from generic objects in
a language-theoretic sense is
the magic <code>length</code> property:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If a new property is added, and the property name
    is the stringification of a whole number,
    then the <code>length</code> is updated to the numeric
    value of the added property name, plus 1.
<li>If the <code>length</code> property is modified programmatically,
    the new value must be a whole number,
    and
    all properties which are the stringification of a whole number
    greater than or equal to the new <code>length</code>
    are deleted.
</li></li></ul>

for nitpicky details.)
</p>
<p>
The first step, then, is to delete all the indices that need to be deleted.
</p>
<pre>
indices.forEach(function(n) { delete a[n]; });
</pre>
<p>
When applied to our sample data, this leaves
</p>
<table border="0">

<tr>
<td><code>a[1] </code></td>
<td><code>= "bob";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a[3] </code></td>
<td><code>= "david";<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.length</code></td>
<td><code>= 5;<code></code></code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
which
gets printed in a rather goofy way:
<code>a = [, "bob", , "dave", ]</code>.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to close up the gaps.
We take advantage of the fact that the <code>Array</code>
enumeration methods operate on indices 0 through <code>length - 1</code>
and that they <i>skip missing elements</i>.
Therefore, I can simply apply a dummy filter:
</p>
<pre>
a = a.filter(function() { return true; });
</pre>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
What is the difference (aside from performance) between
<code>a.push(1);</code> and <code>a = a.concat(1);</code>?
How is this question relevant to today's exercise?</p>
