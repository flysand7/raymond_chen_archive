<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mount points, volumes, and physical drives, oh my!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>At the bottom of the storage hierarchy are physical drives. These are units of physical storage, access to which is governed by a single disk controller. Your SSD or hard drive is a physical drive.¹</p>
<p>The next layer up is the volume. A volume is region of storage that is managed by a single file system. The relationship between volumes and physical drives is typically one-to-one, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>For example, a physical drive might not have any volume associated with it at all. For example, it could be a raw hard drive that hasn’t been partitioned or formatted yet.</p>
<p>You might take your physical drive and create multiple partitions, and then format each partition separately. Each of those formatted partitions is its own volume.</p>
<p>Or you might get really fancy and use a feature like spanned volumes or Storage Spaces to take multiple physical drives and combine them into one giant volume.</p>
<p>Once you have your volumes, you need to make them accessible somehow.²</p>
<p>Mount points are places that volumes are inserted into the namespace and become paths. The most usual place to see them is as a drive letter. For example, your system boot volume is almost certainly mounted as <code>C:</code>.</p>
<p>Volumes don’t have to be mounted as drive letters, though. You can also mount them inside a subdirectory of an existing volume, sort of like grafting one tree onto another. One way to do this is by going to the Disk Management tool, right-clicking a volume, and selecting <i>Change drive letter and paths</i>. From there, you can add a path for a volume, and the contents of the volume will be visible via that path.</p>
<p>Note that a volume can be mounted in multiple places, or it might not be mounted at all.</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll look at how to navigate these concepts in code.</p>
<p>¹ Paradoxically, you can have virtual physical drives, like a RAM drive.</p>
<p>² Theoretically, you could eschew mounting the volume and just access it via its volume GUID.</p>

<p>I mean, theoretically you could do that, but you’d also be a little bit crazy.</p>
