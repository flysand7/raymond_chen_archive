<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The scope of the C# checked/unchecked keyword is static, not dynamic</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
C# has operators <code>checked</code> and <code>unchecked</code>
to control the behavior of the language in the face of integer overflow.
There are also <code>checked</code> and <code>unchecked</code> statements
which apply the behavior to blocks of statements rather than single
expressions.
</p>
<pre>
int x;
x = checked(a + b); // evaluate with overflow checking
y = unchecked(a + b); // evaluate without overflow checking
checked {
 x = a + b; // evaluate with overflow checking
}
unchecked {
 x = a + b; // evaluate without overflow checking
}
</pre>
<p>
Why, then, doesn’t this code below raise an overflow exception?
</p>
<pre>
class Program {
 static int Multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
 static int Overflow() { return Multiply(int.MaxValue, 2); }
 public static void Main() {
  System.Console.WriteLine(checked(Overflow()));
  checked {
    System.Console.WriteLine(Overflow());
  }
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
(Mini-exercise: Why couldn’t I have just written
<code>static int Overflow() { return int.MaxValue * 2; }</code>?)
</p>
<p>
The answer is that the scope of the <code>checked</code> or
<code>unchecked</code> keyword is static, not dynamic.
Whether a particular arithmetic is checked or unchecked is
determined at compile time, not at run time.
Since the multiplication in the <code>Multiply</code> function
is not explicitly marked checked or unchecked,
uses the overflow context implied by your compiler options.
Assuming you’ve left it at the default of
<code>unchecked</code>,
this means that
there is no overflow checking in the <code>Multiply</code> function,
even if you call it from a checked context.
Because once you call the <code>Multiply</code> function,
you have left the checked context.
</p>
<p>
The C# language specification addresses this issue not once,
not twice, but three times!
(But it seems that some people miss it,
possibly because there is
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/04/10/10409822.aspx">
too much documentation</a>.)
</p>
<p>
First, there is an
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691349(v=VS.71).aspx">
explicit list</a> of
operations which
are controlled by the <code>checked</code> or <code>unchecked</code>
keyword:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<ul>
<li>The predefined <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> unary operators,
    when the operand is of an integral type.
<li>The predefined <code>-</code> unary operator,
    when the operand is of an integral type.
<li>The predefined <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>,
    <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code> binary operators,
    when both operands are of integral types.
<li>Explicit numeric conversions from one integral type to another
    integral type, or from <code>float</code> or <code>double</code>
    to an integral type.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s all.
Note that function calls are not on the list.
</p>
<p>
Now, that may have been a bit too subtle (documentation by omission),
so the language specific goes ahead and calls it out.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
The <code>checked</code> and <code>unchecked</code> operators
only affect the overflow checking context for those operations
that are textually contained within the “<code>(</code>”
and “<code>)</code>” tokens.
The operators have no effect on function members
that are invoked as a result of evaluating the contained expression.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then, in case you still didn’t get it, the language specification
even includes an example:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<pre>
class Test
{
   static int Multiply(int x, int y) {
      return x * y;
   }
   static int F() {
      return checked(Multiply(1000000, 1000000));
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The use of <code>checked</code> in <code>F</code> does not
affect the evaluation of <code>x * y</code> in
<code>Multiply</code>,
so <code>x * y</code> is evaluated in the default overflow
checking context.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(I wrote my example before consulting the language specification.
That we both chose to use multiplication overflow is just a coincidence.)
</p>
<p>
Even though the language specification
<a href="http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/carrol03.html">
says it three times</a>,
in three different ways,
there are still people who are under the mistaken impression that
the scope of the <code>checked</code> keyword is dynamic.
</p>
<p>
Another thing you may have notice is that the <code>checked</code>
and <code>unchecked</code> keywords apply only to the built-in
arithmetic operations on integers.
They do not apply to overloaded operators or to operators on custom
classes.
</p>
<p>
Which makes sense if you think about it,
because in order to define an overloaded operator or an operator
on a custom class,
you need to write the implementation as a separate function,
in which case you have already left the scope of the
<code>checked</code> and <code>unchecked</code> keywords.
</p>
<p>
And now we are leaving the scope of CLR Week.
You can remove your hands from your ears now.</p>
