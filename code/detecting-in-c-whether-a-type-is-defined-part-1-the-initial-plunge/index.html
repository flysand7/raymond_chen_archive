<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Detecting in C++ whether a type is defined, part 1: The initial plunge</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><b>Warning to those who got here via a search engine</b>: Don’t use this version. Keep reading to the end of the series.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to be able to detect in C++ whether a type has been defined. For example, maybe you want to use a type if it exists. This can happen if, say, you are a library like <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-windows"> React Native for Windows</a>, and you need to be able to run with different versions of the Windows SDK. Or you’re writing a library where the client can customize the behavior by defining another class with a well-known name. Perhaps you’re trying to mimic C# partial classes.</p>
<p>My initial idea was to take advantage of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/unqualified_lookup"> unqualified name lookup</a> by creating an alternate definition for the type that sits at a lower priority than the one we’re looking for.</p>
<pre>// awesome.h
namespace awesome
{
  // might or might not contain
  struct special { ... };
}

// your code
namespace detect::impl
{
  struct not_implemented {};
  using special = not_implemented;
}

namespace awesome::detect
{
  using namespace ::detect::impl;
  constexpr bool is_special_defined =
    !std::is_same_v&lt;special, ::detect::impl::not_implemented&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>The idea here is that I declare an alternate version of the <code>special</code> structure in the <code>detect::impl</code> namespace, and place it in the search order at a location that comes <i>after</i> searching in the <code>awesome</code> namespace.</p>
<p>The <code>using namespace ::detect</code><code>::impl;</code> directive makes the names from the <code>detect::impl</code> visible as if they had been declared in the global namespace. Why the global namespace? Because the rule for <code>using namespace</code> is that the names from the imported-from namespace are treated as if they had been declared in the namespace which is the nearest common ancestor of the importing namespace and the imported-from namespace. In our case, the imported-from namespace is <code>::detect</code><code>::impl</code> and the importing namespace is <code>::awesome</code><code>::detect</code>. Since they don’t even share a common top-level namespace, the nearest common ancestor is the global namespace.</p>
<p>Next, I check the name <code>special</code>. The unqualified name lookup searches in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>::awesome</code><code>::detect</code><code>::special</code></li>
<li><code>::awesome</code><code>::special</code></li>
<li><code>::special</code> (which, thanks to our <code>using namespace ::detect</code><code>::impl;</code> directive also searches in <code>::detect</code><code>::impl</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is definitely no <code>special</code> declared in the <code>::awesome</code><code>::detect</code> namespace, so it comes down to the other two. If it exists in the <code>::awesome</code> namespace, then the unqualified lookup will find that type; otherwise, it will find the one in the <code>::detect</code><code>::impl</code> namespace.</p>
<p>We then use <code>std::</code><code>is_same_v</code> to see whether the type we found is our fake one.</p>
<p>This works, but it’s awkward because you have to do the detection from inside the <code>::awesome</code><code>::detect</code> namespace, since that’s where we set up the search order. For every type you want to detect, you need to create an alias in the <code>::detect</code><code>::impl</code> namespace and a custom <code>is_whatever_defined</code> constant.</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll look at my second attempt.</p>
