<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the debugger telling me I crashed because my DLL was unloaded, when I see it loaded right here happily executing code?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer was puzzled by what appeared to be contradictory information
coming from the debugger.

We have Windows Error Reporting failures that tell us that we
are executing code in our DLL which has been unloaded.
Here’s a sample stack:

But if we ask the debugger what modules are loaded,
our DLL is right there, loaded as happy as can be:
</p>
<pre>
0:000&gt; lm
start             end                 module name
...
000007f6`e6000000 000007f6`e6050000   contoso    (deferred)
...
</pre>
<p>
In fact, we can view other threads in the process,
and they are happily running code in our DLL.
What’s going on here?

All the information you need to solve this problem is given
right there in the problem report.
You just have to put the pieces together.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a closer look at that
<code>&lt;Unloaded_contoso.dll&gt;+0x3390c</code>
entry.
The address that the symbol refers to is the return address
from the previous frame:
<code>000007f6`e5d5390c</code>.
Subtract <code>0x3390c</code> from that, and you get
<code>000007f6`e5d20000</code>,
which is the base address of the unloaded module.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the <code>lm</code> command says that
the currently-loaded copy of <code>contoso.dll</code> is
loaded at
<code>000007f6`e6000000</code>.
This is a <i>different address</i>.
</p>
<p>
What happened here is that <code>contoso.dll</code> was
loaded into memory at <code>000007f6`e5d20000</code>,
and then it ran for a while.
The DLL was then unloaded from memory,
and later loaded back into memory.
When it returned, it was loaded at a different address
<code>000007f6`e6000000</code>.
For some reason
(improper cleanup when unloading the first copy, most likely),
there was still a function pointer pointing into the old
unloaded copy, and when <code>NDRS­Rundown­Context­Handle</code>
tries to call into that function pointer,
it calls into an unloaded DLL,
and you crash.
</p>
<p>
When faced with something that seems impossible,
you need to look more closely for clues that suggest
how your implicit assumptions may be incorrect.
In this case, the assumption was that there was only one
copy of <code>contoso.dll</code>.</p>
