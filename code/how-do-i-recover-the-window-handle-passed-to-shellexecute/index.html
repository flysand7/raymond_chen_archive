<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I recover the window handle passed to ShellExecute?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I’m using the <code>ShellExecute</code> function to launch a new process and am passing the handle to my application’s main window as the <code>hwnd</code> parameter. From the new process, I want to get information from the old process, and to do that, I need the window handle. How can I recover that window handle from the new process? </p></blockquote>
<p> You can’t.
 That window handle is used by the <code>ShellExecute</code> function only to host any user interface operations that occur as a result of the attempt to execute the program. For example, it is the owner window used for any error dialogs. The <code>ShellExecute</code> function does not pass the window handle to the launched process. (It couldn’t even if it wanted to: There is nowhere to pass it. There is no window handle among the parameters to <code>CreateProcess</code> nor is there a window handle in the <code>STARTUPINFO</code> structure.)</p>
<p> If you want to pass this information to the process being launched, you’ll have to come up with your own mechanism for transferring this information. For example, you can pass it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/10/56028.aspx"> on the command line</a>, or if you have a lot of information to pass, you can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/11/56043.aspx"> use a shared memory block</a>. </p>
