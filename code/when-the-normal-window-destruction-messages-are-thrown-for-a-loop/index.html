<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When the normal window destruction messages are thrown for a loop</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Last time,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/26/443384.aspx">
I alluded to weirdness that can result in
the normal cycle of destruction messages being thrown out of kilter</a>.
</p>
<p>

Commenter Adrian noted that the <code>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</code> message
arrives before <code>WM_NCCREATE</code> for top-level windows</a>.
This is indeed unfortunate but (mistake or not)
it’s been that way for over a decade and changing it now
would introduce serious compatibility risk.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not the weirdness I had in mind.
</p>
<p>
Some time ago I was helping to debug a problem with
a program that was using
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/listview/listview.asp">
the ListView control</a>,
and the problem was traced to the program subclassing the
ListView control and, through a complicated chain of
C++ objects, ending up attempting to destroy the ListView
control while it was already in the process of being destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take
<a>
our new scratch program</a>
and illustrate what happens in a more obvious manner.
</p>
<pre>
class RootWindow : public Window
{
public:
 <font color="blue">RootWindow() : m_cRecurse(0) { }</font>
 …
private:
 <font color="blue">void CheckWindow(LPCTSTR pszMessage) {
  OutputDebugString(pszMessage);
  if (IsWindow(m_hwnd)) {
   OutputDebugString(TEXT(” – window still exists\r\n”));
  } else {
   OutputDebugString(TEXT(” – window no longer exists\r\n”));
  }
 }</font>
private:
 HWND m_hwndChild;
 <font color="blue">UINT m_cRecurse;</font>
 …
};</pre></p>
<p>LRESULT RootWindow::HandleMessage(
                          UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 …
  case WM_NCDESTROY:
   <font color="blue">CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_NCDESTROY received”));
   if (m_cRecurse &lt; 2) {
    m_cRecurse++;
    CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_NCDESTROY recursing”));
    DestroyWindow(m_hwnd);
    CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_NCDESTROY recursion returned”));
   }</font>
   PostQuitMessage(0);
   break;</p>
<p> <font color="blue">case WM_DESTROY:
   CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_DESTROY received”));
   if (m_cRecurse &lt; 1) {
    m_cRecurse++;
    CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_DESTROY recursing”));
    DestroyWindow(m_hwnd);
    CheckWindow(TEXT(“WM_DESTROY recursion returned”));
   }
   break;</font>
  …
}

<p>
We add some debug traces to make it easier to see what is going on.
Run the program, then close it, and watch what happens.

</pre>
<p>
Yikes!  What happened?
</p>
<p>
When you clicked the “X” button, this started the window destruction
process.
As is to be expected,
the window received a <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message,
but the program responds to this by attempting to destroy the window
<strong>again</strong>.
Notice that <code>IsWindow</code> reported that the window still
exists at this point.
This is true: The window does still exist,
although it happens to be in the process of being destroyed.
In the original scenario, the code that destroyed the window went
something like
</p>
<pre>
if (IsWindow(hwndToDestroy)) {
 DestroyWindow(hwndToDestroy);
}
</pre>
<p>
At any rate, the recursive call to <code>DestroyWindow</code>
caused a <strong>new</strong> window destruction cycle to begin,
nested inside the first one.
This generates a new <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message,
followed by a <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message.
(Notice that this window has now received
<strong>two</strong> <code>WM_DESTROY</code> messages!)
Our bizarro code then makes yet another
recursive call to <code>DestroyWindow</code>,
which starts a <strong>third</strong> window destruction cycle.
The window gets its third <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message,
then its second <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message, at which point
the second recursive call to <code>DestroyWindow</code> returns.
At this point, the window no longer exists:
<code>DestroyWindow</code> has destroyed the window.
</p>
<p>
And that’s why we crash.
The base <code>Window</code> class
handles the <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message by destroying the
instance variables associated with the window.
Therefore, when the innermost <code>DestroyWindow</code>
returns, the instance variables have been thrown away.
Execution then resumes with the base class’s
<code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> handler, which tries to access
the instance variables and gets heap garbage,
and then makes the even worse no-no of freeing memory that
is already freed, thereby corrupting the heap.
It is here that we crash, attempting to call the virtual
destructor on an already-destructed object.
</p>
<p>
I intentionally chose to use the new scratch program
(which uses C++ objects) instead of the classic scratch program
(which uses global variables) to highlight the fact that
after the recursive <code>DestroyWindow</code> call,
all the instance variables are gone and you are operating on
freed memory.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story:
Understand your window lifetimes
and don’t destroy a window that you know already to be
in the process of destruction.</p>
