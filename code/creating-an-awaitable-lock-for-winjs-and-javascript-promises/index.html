<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Creating an awaitable lock for WinJS and JavaScript Promises</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180802-00/?p=99395">Last time</a>, we created an awaitable lock for C++ PPL tasks. Let’s do the same thing for WinJS Promises (because I needed one of those too). </p>
<pre>
var AwaitableLock = WinJS.Class.define(function AwaitableLock() {
  this._locked = false;
  this._p = null;
  this._c = null;
}, {
  waitAsync: function waitAsync() {
    if (!this._locked) {
      // Lock is available. Acquire it.
      this._locked = true;
      return WinJS.Promise.wrap();
    }

    // Lock is not available.
    var self = this;
    if (!this._p) {
      // Create a promise that completes when the lock is released.
      this._p = new WinJS.Promise(function (c) { self._c = c; });
    }

    // Return a promise that waits for the lock to be released
    // and then retries the wait.
    return this._p.then(function () { return self.waitAsync(); });
  },

  release: function release() {
    this._locked = false;
    var c = this._c;
    this._p = null;
    this._c = null;

    // Complete any promise that was waiting for release.
    c &amp;&amp; c();
  }
});
</pre>
<p>Since JavaScript is single-threaded, we don’t have to worry about concurrency, so we don’t need a mutex to guard our state variables. If the lock is available, then acquire it and return a completed promise. </p>
<p>Otherwise, we have to create a promise. The <code>WinJS.Promise</code> constructor takes a function which in turn receives a few parameters, although we use only <code>c</code> here. The <code>c</code> parameter is itself a function that our code can call to complete the promise. All we do is save that callback in the <code>_c</code> property so that we can complete the promise later. To avoid having to remember multiple completion callbacks, we create this promise once and cache it in the <code>_p</code> property. </p>
<p>We then chain a continuation on that newly-created promise that restarts the <code>waitAsync</code>, and return the resulting promise. </p>
<p>When the lock is released, we clear the saved completion and promise (thereby resetting the lock object to its unlocked state), and if there is a completion function, we call it. This completes the promise we created in <code>waitAsync</code>, which means that each of them will race to <code>waitAsync</code> and retry the acquisition. </p>
<p>There is a subtlety here: We reset the lock object completely before calling the completion. The completion is going to attempt to re-acquire the lock object, and we don’t want the reentrant call to see a lock object in an inconsistent state. To avoid that, we capture the completion callback into a local <code>c</code>, and then after the lock object has been reset, we call the callback if necessary. </p>
<p>We can use ES6 function arrow notation to simplify this code, but if we’re going to do that, we may as well go all the way and use ES6 native promises. </p>

var AwaitableLock = WinJS.Class.define(function AwaitableLock() {
  this._locked = false;
  this._p = null;
  this._c = null;
}, {
  <font color="blue">waitAsync()</font> {
    if (!this._locked) {
      // Lock is available. Acquire it.
      this._locked = true;
      return <font color="blue">Promise.resolve()</font>;
    }

    // Lock is not available.
    if (!this._p) {
      // Create a promise that completes when the lock is released.
      this._p = new <font color="blue">Promise</font>(<font color="blue">c =&gt; this._c = c</font>);
    }

    return this._p.then(<font color="blue">() =&gt; this.waitAsync()</font>);
  },

  <font color="blue">release()</font> {
    this._locked = false;
    var c = this._c;
    this._p = null;
    this._c = null;

    // Complete any promise that was waiting for release.
    c &amp;&amp; c();
  }
});
</pre>
<p>The ES6 Promise method for creating an already-completed promise is called <code>resolve</code>, as opposed to <code>wrap</code>, which is what <code>WinJS.Promise</code> calls it. The Promise constructor is the same, so we didn’t have to make any changes there aside from arrowizing the functions. Arrowizing is convenient because it preserves <code>this</code> inside the lambda, which saves us the trouble of having to create a separate <code>self</code> variable. </p>
<p>And since we’re abandoning WinJS, we may as well go all the way and define the class using ES6’s native class declaration syntax. </p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">class AwaitableLock {</font>
  <font color="blue">constructor()</font> {
    this._locked = false;
    this._p = null;
    this._c = null;
  }

  <font color="blue">waitAsync()</font> {
    if (!this._locked) {
      // Lock is available. Acquire it.
      this._locked = true;
      return Promise.resolve();
    }

    // Lock is not available.
    if (!this._p) {
      // Create a promise that completes when the lock is released.
      this._p = new Promise(c =&gt; this._c = c);
    }

    return this._p.then(() =&gt; this.waitAsync());
  }

  <font color="blue">release()</font> {
    this._locked = false;
    var c = this._c;
    this._p = null;
    this._c = null;

    // Complete any promise that was waiting for release.
    c &amp;&amp; c();
  }
}
</pre>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Why couldn’t we arrowize the constructor? </p>
<p><b>Exercise 2</b>: Why did we set the member variables dynamically in the constructor instead of defining them statically on the prototype? </p>
<p><b>Exercise 3</b>: Why couldn’t I have precalculated the <code>.then</code> of the promise? </p>
