<p>
To detect programmatically whether your 32-bit program is running
on 64-bit Windows, you can use the IsWow64Process function.
</p>
<p>
Do not do
as some people do and
<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/khanna/archive/2004/07/14/8374.aspx">
hard-code the list of 64-bit processors</a>.
You’d think that after the hard-coded list of 64-bit processors
changed the first time (when x64 was added to ia64), people would have
learned their lesson.
</p>
<p>
But how do you detect programmatically from your 64-bit process
whether you are running on 64-bit Windows?  Easy.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL Is64BitProcessRunningOn64BitWindows()
{
 return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
The fact that your 64-bit program is running at all
means that you are running on 64-bit Windows!
If it were a 32-bit machine, your program wouldn’t be
able to run.
</p>
<p>
It’s like asking the question, “Is the power on?”
If there were no power, your program wouldn’t be able to ask the question.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you want a single source code base that can be
compiled both as a 32-bit program and as a 64-bit program,
you have a tiny amount of work to do.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL Is64BitWindows()
{
#if defined(_WIN64)
 return TRUE;  // 64-bit programs run only on Win64
#elif defined(_WIN32)
 // 32-bit programs run on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows
 // so must sniff
 BOOL f64 = FALSE;
 return IsWow64Process(GetCurrentProcess(), &amp;f64) &amp;&amp; f64;
#else
 return FALSE; // Win64 does not support Win16
#endif
}
</pre>
<p>
I threw in a branch for 16-bit programs if you’re crazy enough
to be still writing 16-bit Windows programs.</p>
