<p>
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/">Eric Lippert</a> has posted <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2003/09/12/erics-complete-guide-to-bstr-semantics/">Eric’s
        Complete Guide to BSTR Semantics</a>. This is a document that is widely valued within
        Microsoft, since BSTR semantics are rather tricky, and I’m glad he’s willing to share
        it with the world.
    </p>
<p>
        In particular, Eric spends quite a bit of time discussion the very important equivalence
        of NULL and L”” in BSTR semantics, something that is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021015194204/http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/automat/htm/chap7_2xgz.asp">buried
        in paragraph seven of an MSDN document you probably didn’t even bother reading</a>.
    </p>
<p>    If you ask nicely, you might be able to convince him to post his “Complete history
    of OLEDATE”.</p>
