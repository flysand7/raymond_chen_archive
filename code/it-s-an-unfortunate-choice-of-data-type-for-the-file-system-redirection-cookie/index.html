<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It’s an unfortunate choice of data type for the file system redirection cookie</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you want to disable 64-bit file system redirection, you call the <code>Wow64­Disable­Wow64­Fs­Redirection</code> function. This function gives you a cookie. When you are finished, you call <code>Wow64­Revert­Wow64­Fs­Redirection</code>, passing the cookie you received from the previous call. Like this: </p>
<pre>
void* cookie;
if (Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection(&amp;cookie)) {
   ... do stuff ...
   Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection(cookie);
}
</pre>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that the data type for the cookie is an untyped pointer: <code>void*</code>. This means that the following mistake goes undetected: </p>
<pre>
<i>// Remember: Code in italics is wrong.
void* cookie;
if (Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection(&amp;cookie)) {
   ... do stuff ...
   Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection(&amp;cookie);
}</i>
</pre>
<p>The erroneous parameter to <code>Wow64­Revert­Wow64­Fs­Redirection</code> goes undetected because <code>void**</code> is implicitly convertible to <code>void*</code>. Because <i>any pointer</i> is implicitly convertible to <code>void*</code>, because <code>void*</code> is a generic pointer. </p>
<p>In retrospect, the type of the cookie used by the file system redirection functions should have been something other than <code>void*</code>. It could have used <code>DECLARE_HANDLE</code>, which declares a pointer to a dummy structure with a unique name. Or it could have been a pointer to a uniquely-named incomplete type. </p>
