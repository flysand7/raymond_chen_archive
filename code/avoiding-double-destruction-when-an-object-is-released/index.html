As we saw last time,
trying to do too much in one’s destructor can lead to an object
being destroyed twice</a>.
The standard way to work around this problem is to set an artificial
reference count during destruction.
</p>
<pre>
class MyObject : public IUnknown
{
 …
 ULONG Release()
 {
  LONG cRef = InterlockedDecrement(&amp;m_cRef);
  if (cRef == 0) {
   <font color="blue">m_cRef = DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT;</font>
   delete this;
  }
  return cRef;
 }
 …
private:
 }
 <font color="blue">enum { DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT = 42 };</font>
 ~MyObject()
 {
  if (m_fNeedSave) Save();
  <font color="blue">assert(m_cRef == DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT);</font>
 }
};
</pre>
<p>
If you have a common implementation of <code>IUnknown</code>,
you can set the reference count to <code>DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT</code>
in your implementation of <code>IUnknown::Release</code> like we
did here, and assert that the value is correct in your implementation’s
destructor.
Since C++ runs base class destructors after derived class destructors,
your base class destructor will check the reference count after the
derived class has done its cleanup.
</p>
<p>
By setting the reference count to an artificial non-zero value,
any <code>AddRef()</code> and
<code>Release()</code> calls that occur will not trigger
a duplicate destruction (assuming of course that nobody in
the destructor path has a bug that causes them to over-release).
The assertion at the end ensures that no new references to the
object have been created during destruction.
</p>
<p>
This is really more of a workaround than a rock-solid solution,
because it assumes that no functions called during the destruction
sequence retain a reference to the object beyond the function’s
return.
This is in general not something you can assume about COM.
In general, a method is free to call
<code>AddRef</code> and hang onto a pointer to an object
in order to complete the requested operation later.
Some methods
(such as
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/components/com/reference/ifaces/ipersistpropertybag/load.asp">
the <code>IPersistPropertyBag::Load</code> method</a>)
explicitly forbid such behavior, but these types of methods are
more the exception rather than the rule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exercise</strong>:
Why is it safe to perform a simple assignment
<code>m_cRef = DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT</code> instead of
the more complicated
<code>InterlockedExchangeAdd(&amp;m_cRef, DESTRUCTOR_REFCOUNT)</code>?
