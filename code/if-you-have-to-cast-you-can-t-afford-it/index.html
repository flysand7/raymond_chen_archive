A customer reported a crash inside a function we’ll call
<code>XyzConnect</code>:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD XyzConnect(
    __in DWORD ConnectionType,
    __in PCWSTR Server,
    __in PCWSTR Target,
    __out void **Handle);
...
// HACK - Create a dummy structure to pass to the XyzConnect
// function to avoid AV within the function.
int dummy = 0;
if ( NO_ERROR != ( XyzConnect( 0, L"", L"", (PVOID*)&amp;dummy ) )
{
    TRACE( L"XyzConnect failed." );
    return FALSE;
}
...
</pre>
<p>
The title of today’s entry gives the answer away.
(The title is also an exaggeration, but it’s a pun on
the saying
<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/53/messages/626.html">
<i>If you have to ask, you can’t afford it</i></a>.)
</p>
<p>
The last parameter to the <code>XyzConnect</code> function is
declared as a <code>void**</code>: A pointer to a generic pointer.
Note that it is not itself a generic pointer, however.
A generic pointer can point to anything, possibly unaligned.
But this is an aligned pointer to a generic pointer.
Therefore, the memory for the generic pointer must be aligned
in a manner appropriate to its type.
</p>
<p>
But this caller didn’t pass a pointer to a pointer;
the caller passed a pointer to an <code>int</code>,
and an <code>int</code> has different alignment requirements
from a pointer on 64-bit systems.
(You might conclude that this decision was the stupidest decision
on the face of the planet, but that’s a different argument for
a different time. For example, I can think of decisions far stupider.)
</p>
<p>
When the <code>XyzConnect</code> function tries to dereference this
purported <code>void **</code> pointer,
it encounters an alignment fault, because it does not in fact
point to a <code>void *</code> as the type claims,
but rather points to a <code>DWORD</code>.
A <code>DWORD</code> requires only 32-bit alignment,
so you have a 50% chance that the <code>DWORD*</code>
is not suitably aligned to be a <code>void*</code>.
</p>
<p>
Mind you, you also have a 100% chance of a buffer overflow,
because a <code>DWORD</code> is only four bytes,
whereas a <code>void*</code> is eight bytes.
The function is going to write eight bytes
into your four-byte buffer.
</p>
<p>
When this question was posed, one person suggested changing
the <code>DWORD</code> to a <code>__int64</code>,
since the <code>__int64</code> is an 8-byte value, which is
big enough to hold a pointer on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.
Then again, it’s overkill on 32-bit systems, since you allocated
eight bytes when you only needed four.
Another suggestion was to use <code>DWORD_PTR</code>,
since that type changes in size to match
the size of a <code>void*</code>.
</p>
<p>
Well, yeah, but here’s another type that matches the size
of a <code>void*</code>: It’s called <code>void*</code>.
</p>
<p>
Just declare <code>void *dummy</code> and get rid of the cast.
And get rid of the comment while you’re at it.
If you do it right, you don’t need the cast or the hack.
</p>
<pre>
void *handle = 0;
if ( NO_ERROR != ( XyzConnect( 0, L"", L"", &amp;handle ) )
{
    TRACE( L"XyzConnect failed." );
    return FALSE;
}
</pre>
<p>
A large number of porting problems can be traced to incorrect casts.
The original author probably
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/15/58973.aspx">
inserted the cast to “shut up the compiler”</a>
but the compiler was trying to tell you something.
</p>
<p>
Any time you see a function cast or see a cast to/from something
other than <code>void*</code> or <code>BYTE*</code>,
then you should be suspicious,
because there’s a chance somebody is simply trying to shut up
the compiler.</p>
