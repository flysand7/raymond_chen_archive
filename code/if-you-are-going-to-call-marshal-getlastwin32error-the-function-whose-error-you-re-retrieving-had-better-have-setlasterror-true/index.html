<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you are going to call Marshal.GetLastWin32Error, the function whose error you’re retrieving had better have SetLastError=true</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that their p/invoke to a custom DLL was failing, and the error code made no sense. <span id="more-91791"></span></p>
<pre>
// C#
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Program
{
  [DllImport("contoso.dll", CallingConvention=CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
  public static extern int Fribble();

  public static void Main()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("About to call Fribble");

    var result = Fribble();
    if (result &gt;= 0) {
      Console.WriteLine("succeeded {0}", result);
    } else {
      Console.WriteLine("failed {0}, last error = {1}",
                        result, Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
    }
  }
}

// C++

int __cdecl Fribble()
{
 HANDLE hEvent = OpenEvent(EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, FALSE,
                           TEXT("FribbleEvent"));
 if (hEvent == nullptr)
  return -1;
 }

 if (!SetEvent(hEvent)) {
  CloseHandle(hEvent);
  return -2;
 }

 CloseHandle(hEvent);
 return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>The customer reported that their <code>Fribble</code> function was returning −1, indicating a failure to open the event, but the error code returned by <code>Marshal.Get­Last­Win32­Error</code> is 87, “The parameter is incorrect.” But all of the parameters to <code>Open­Event</code> look correct. Why are we getting this strange error code? </p>
<p>My psychic powers tell me that if the customer had taken the time to troubleshoot their problem by writing a C++ program that calls the <code>Fribble</code> function, <code>Get­Last­Error</code> would have returned the more reasonable <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/27/9953807.aspx">error 2</a>, meaning that the event does not exist. </p>
<p>That’s because <code>Get­Last­Error</code> is working fine. The last error code is 2. </p>
<p>The problem is with the p/invoke declaration. </p>
<p>The documentation for the <code>Marshal.Get­Last­Win32­Error</code> function says as its very first line </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Returns the error code returned by the last unmanaged function that was called using platform invoke <i>that has the DllImportAttribute.SetLastError flag set</i>. </p></blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.) </p>
<p>This reminder about <code>Dll­Import­Attribute.Set­Last­Error</code> is repeated in the Remarks. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>You can use this method to obtain error codes only if you apply the System.Runtime.Interop­Services.Dll­Import­Attribute to the method signature and set the <code>Set­Last­Error</code> field to <b>true</b>. </p></blockquote>
<p>Observe that the <code>Set­Last­Error</code> field was not set in the p/invoke declaration. Therefore, what you are actually getting when you call <code>Marshal.Get­Last­Win32­Error</code> is whatever error was lying around after the previous call to a p/invoke function that <i>did</i> specify <code>Set­Last­Error = true</code>. </p>
<p>Changing the p/invoke to </p>

<p>fixed the problem. </p>
