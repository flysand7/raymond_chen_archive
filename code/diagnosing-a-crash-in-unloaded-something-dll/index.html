<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Diagnosing a crash in unloaded_something.dll</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A failure report came in to the shell team because Explorer crashed at shutdown in what the debugger reported as <code>unloaded_themeui.dll</code>. Time to dig in. </p>
<pre>

&lt;Unloaded_themeui.dll&gt;+0x2bbfbd:
00007ff8`e384bfbd ??              ???
</pre>
<p>Yup, there’s nothing loaded there all right. But let’s see what was loaded there before. </p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; lm
...
Unloaded modules:
...
00007ff8`e3590000 00007ff8`e385d000   themeui.dll
00007ff8`e3840000 00007ff8`e385d000   abcdefg.dll
</pre>
<p>So there were two DLLs that used to be loaded at the address that crashed. Which could it be? </p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; !reload /unl themeui.dll
0:001&gt; u 00007ff8`e384bfbd
themeui!ext-ms-win-com-ole32-l1-1-1_NULL_THUNK_DATA_DLA &lt;PERF&gt; (themeui+0x2bffdd):
00007ff8`e384bfbd 40              ???
</pre>
<p>Well, that doesn’t look like code. How about abcdefg? </p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; !reload /unl abcdefg.dll
0:001&gt; u 00007ff8`e384bfbd-80
...
abcdefg!AbcdefgImageList::GetClassImageList+0x1f
00007ff8`e384bfb7 ff1593a20000    call    [abcdefg!_imp_SetupDiGetClassImageList]
00007ff8`e384bfbd 85c0            test    eax,eax
</pre>
<p>That looks a lot more promising. What appears to have happened is that <code>abcdefg.dll</code> called <code>Setup­Di­Get­Class­Image­List</code>, and while the call was in progress, the DLL got unloaded. When the call to <code>Setup­Di­Get­Class­Image­List</code> finally returned, it returned to an unloaded DLL, which is the source of the crash. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130906-00/?p=3303">Reconstructing the stack</a> revealed a chain of calls that made sense in the context of <code>abcdefg.dll</code>, so this diagnosis is probably correct. (I’ve anonymized the name of the other DLL to protect the guilty.) </p>
<p>What happened is that during Explorer startup, <code>abcdefg.dll</code> registered a wait with the thread pool on an event, and at shutdown it unregisters the wait. But it unregisters with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686870(v=vs.85).aspx">the <code>Unregister­Wait</code> function</a>. If a callback is running at the time the wait is unregistered, the function returns <code>ERROR_IO_PENDING</code>, but nobody checks. The shutdown code proceeds to unload <code>abcdefg.dll</code>, and then we are left executing code that was freed. </p>
<p>The code in <code>abcdefg.dll</code> needs to handle the case where the callback is still running at the time the wait is unregistered. You can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686876(v=vs.85).aspx">the <code>Unregister­Wait­Ex</code> function</a>, which lets you pass an event that is set when the callback completes, or pass <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code> to wait synchronously for the callback to complete before returning. </p>
