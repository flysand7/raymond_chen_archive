<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wrong way to determine the size of a buffer</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

A colleague of mine showed me some code from a back-end

Fortunately, the company that wrote this is out of business.
Or at least I hope they’re out of business!

size = 16384;
while (size &amp;&amp; IsBadReadPtr(buffer, size)) {
    size--;
}
