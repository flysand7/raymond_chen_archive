<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Use GFlags to catch the silent killer (silent but deadly)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Suppose you have some process that is mysteriously dying and you can’t figure out why. You think that some other process is doing a <code>Terminate­Process</code> but heck if you can figure out who that is. </p>
<p>Starting in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the GFlags tool will let you catch these miscreants. </p>
<p><a href="http://bugslasher.net/2011/04/17/who-the-hell-killed-my-process/">On the <i>Silent Process Exit</i> tab</a>, you enter the program you want to keep an extra eye on and check the box <i>Enable Silent Process Exit Monitoring</i> and select what you want to happen when one of these mysterious exits occurs. You can ask for an entry in the event log that identifies the killer, and you can ask for debugging minidumps to be created of both the killer and the victim. </p>
