<p>Continuing our series on getting the computer’s serial number in desktop apps in various languages, we look at PowerShell. </p>
<p>I warned you that you’re going to be underwhelmed, so prepare to be underwhelmed. </p>

$addType = [Windows.System.Profile.SystemManufacturers.SmbiosInformation,
            Windows.System.Profile.SystemManufacturers,
            ContentType=WindowsRuntime]

[Windows.System.Profile.SystemManufacturers.SmbiosInformation]::SerialNumber
</pre>
<p>The first thing we do is add the type to PowerShell, which we do by loading up the type from the Windows Runtime metadata. Specify the type, the parent namespace, and say <code>ContentType = WindowsRuntime</code>. </p>
<p>And that’s it. We can now obtain the <code>Serial­Number</code> static property from the <code>Smbios­Information</code> class just like any other type. </p>
<p>Next time, we’ll wrap things up with a brief discussion of the <code>Smbios­Information</code> class itself. </p>
