<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">FindFirstFile is not a SQL query</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/fileio/base/findfirstfile.asp"> The <code>FindFirstFile</code> function</a> is not a SQL query. It’s a very simple directory enumerator. There is a slightly fancier version called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/fileio/base/findfirstfileex.asp"> <code>FindFirstFileEx</code></a>, but even that function doesn’t add much at present beyond filtering for directories or devices.</p>
<p> You don’t get to pass it sort criteria like or “return the files/directories sorted smallest file first”, or “<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=cftf1p%245ej%241@hercules.btinternet.com">return the files/directories in reverse order of creation</a>” The only filtering you can provide are the wildcard pattern and (if you use <code>FindFirstFileEx</code>) a directory filter. The wildcard language is very limited as well; it can’t express queries like “files whose extension are either .exe or .dll” or “<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=MPG.18cd1851de9db08a989a93@news.hinet.hr">all files whose extension is .c plus all directories regardless of extension</a>“. You also can’t ask it questions like, “Tell me the total size of the files in this directory”, for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/28/336219.aspx"> as we saw earlier</a>, this question is underspecified. </p>
<p> If you want to do any of those advanced queries, you’ll have to code it up yourself. Or as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hippietim/">Hippie Tim</a> is fond of saying, “Start typing!” </p>
