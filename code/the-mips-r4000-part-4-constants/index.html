<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The MIPS R4000, part 4: Constants</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Since the MIPS R4000 has a fixed 32-bit instruction size, it cannot have a generalized “load 32-bit immediate constant” instruction. (There would be no room in the instruction for the opcode!) </p>
<p>If you look at the integer calculations available, you see that there are some ways of generating constants in a single instruction. </p>
<p>Constants in the range <code>0x00000000</code> to <code>0x0000FFFF</code> can be generated in one instruction by using <code>ORI</code>, which treats its 16-bit immediate as an unsigned value. </p>
<pre>
    ORI     rd, zero, imm16
</pre>
<p>Constants in the range <code>0xFFFF8000</code> to <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> can be generated with the <code>ADDIU</code> instruction, which treats its 16-bit immediate as a signed value.</p>
<pre>
    ADDIU   rd, zero, imm16
</pre>
<p>If we had a <code>NORI</code> instruction, then we could have used it to generate constants in the range <code>0xFFFF0000</code> to <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>:</p>
<pre>
    NORI    rd, zero, imm16
</pre>
<p>But alas that instruction doesn't exist. </p>
<p>To build 32-bit values that cannot be created with these one-instruction tricks, you can use the <code>LUI</code> instruction, which means "load upper immediate". </p>
<pre>
    LUI     rd, imm16           ; rd = imm16 &lt;&lt; 16
</pre>
<p>It loads the 16-bit immediate value into the upper 16 bits of the destination register and zeroes out the bottom 16 bits. You can then follow this up with an <code>ORI</code> to finish the job: </p>
<pre>
    LUI     rd, XXXX            ; rd = XXXX0000
    ORI     rd, rd, YYYY        ; rd = XXXXYYYY
</pre>
<p>There is a data dependency here, and you might expect a pipeline bubble because the <code>ORI</code> depends on the result of the previous instruction, which won't be available until the write-back stage four cycles later. However, the processor supports integer arithmetic <a href="http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~prabhu/Tutorial/PIPELINE/forward.html">forwarding</a>: The result of an arithmetic operation produced in the execute stage can be fed directly to the execute stage of the next instruction, thereby avoiding a stall. </p>
<p>Since the constant is loaded up 16 bits at a time, when a module needs to be relocated, moving it by a multiple of 64<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">KB</a> permits the fixup to be applied only to the <code>XXXX</code> part, leaving the <code>YYYY</code> part alone. (<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031008-00/?p=42223">Previous discussion</a>.) This is a very useful property, because in practice, these two instructions may not be adjacent to each other. The compiler might choose to interleave other calculations to avoid the data dependency stall. </p>
<p>There are a few pseudo-instructions provided by the assembler for loading 32-bit constants. </p>
<pre>
    LI      rd, imm32           ; rd = imm32 (by whatever means)
    LA      rd, global_variable ; rd = address_of global_variable
</pre>
<p>The <code>LI</code> pseudo-instruction loads a 32-bit immediate into <var>rd</var> using a single-instruction trick if available; otherwise, it uses the two-instruction sequence. </p>
<p>The <code>LA</code> pseudo-instruction does the same thing, but the 32-bit value comes from the address of a global variable and is consequently subject to a relocation fixup. </p>
<p>Next time, we'll look at aligned memory access. </p>
