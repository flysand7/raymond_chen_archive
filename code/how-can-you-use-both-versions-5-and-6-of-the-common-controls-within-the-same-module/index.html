<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can you use both versions 5 and 6 of the common controls within the same module?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Commenter Medinoc was baffled by the statement that
the decision to use the visual-styles-enabled version of the
common controls library is done on a window-by-window basis.
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/26/10168421.aspx#10169554">
Isn’t it rather on a per-module basis,
depending on each module’s manifest</a>?
If it is indeed on a per-window basis, how does one choose?”
</p>
<p>
Whether a particular call to
<code>Create­Window</code> (or one of its moral equivalents)
gets the classic version of the control or the visual-styles-enabled
version of the control depends on which activation context is active
at the point of the call.
If an activation context with version 6 of the common controls is active,
then you get the control from version 6 of the common controls.
Otherwise, you get the classic control.
</p>
<p>
If you use the
<code>ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED</code> macro,
then including <code>commctrl.h</code> turns on a bunch of
macros that take all your calls to
<code>Create­Window</code> and related functions,
and converts them into something like this:
</p>
<pre>
HWND CreateWindow_wrapped(... parameters ...)
{
 HWND hwnd = nullptr;
 ULONG_PTR ulCookie;
 if (ActivateActCtx(ModuleContext, &amp;ulCookie)) {
  hwnd = CreateWindow(... parameters ...);
 DeactivateActCtx(0, ulCookie);
 }
 return hwnd;
}
</pre>
<p>
where <code>Module­Context</code> is a global variable
that holds the activation context you specified in your manifest.
</p>
<p>
In other words, any time your code tries to create a window,
the wrapper macros
activate your v6 manifest,
create the window,
then deactivate the manifest.
</p>
<p>
Remember that nobody walks the stack looking to see who the caller is.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/01/47042.aspx">
The return address is not reliable</a>.
(And checking the return address doesn’t help for dynamically-generated
code anyway.)
The way to know which activation context is active is for somebody
to actually come out and set it.
</p>
<p>
Back to the question:
The way you choose whether you want a classic or a visual-styles-enabled
version of a control is by deciding whether or not to have the
v6 manifest active when you call
<code>Create­Window</code>.
</p>
<p>
A common mistake is that people will call a function that requires
a v6 manifest, such as <code>Task­Dialog</code>,
but they will forget to activate the v6 manifest before calling.
The result is that they call into version 6 of the common controls,
but when the common controls library tries to create its task dialog,
<i>it fails</i> because the v5 context is active,
and the v5 context does not have a task dialog control.</p>
