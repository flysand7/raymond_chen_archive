Alun Williams pointed out that

if you pass invalid parameters to <code>DeferWindowPos</code>,
it does not destroy the <code>HDWP</code></a>.
Well, yeah, because if you pass invalid parameters,
then

Different functions perform different degrees of parameter
validation; the degree to which this is done is typically
guided by security concerns.
Information that crosses security boundaries must be fully-validated,
whereas a call to an in-process function has very little in
the way of security obligations
with respect to invalid parameters, since a bad caller could
just mess with the in-process function directly;
no need to try to “trick” it with invalid parameters.
</p>
<p>
In practice, most functions that perform parameter validation go
something like this:
</p>
<pre>
SomeFunction(...)
{
 if (any parameter is invalid) {
   signal invalid parameter error in an appropriate manner
 } else {
   actually do something
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
(In some cases, the validation code is not even written by a human being.
Instead, there’s a script that parses the header files and
autogenerates the validation code.)
</p>
<p>
If there is an invalid parameter,
the entire operation is typically abandoned.
Because, after all, how can you expect a function even to get
off the ground when it doesn’t have all its parameters?
I mean, how can the <code>DeferWindowPos</code> destroy the
<code>HDWP</code> when it fails to validate its parameters,
if the invalid parameter might be the <code>HDWP</code>?
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the degree to which parameter validation occurs,
if you pass invalid parameters,
then (generally speaking) there are no guarantees.
Passing valid parameters is part of the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/20/555511.aspx">
basic ground rules for programming</a>.
If you break your end of the deal,
then the function is under no obligation to hold up its end.</p>
