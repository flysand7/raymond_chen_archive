<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does ASLR relocate all DLLs by the same offset?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve seen multiple claims that the Windows implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a> chooses a single random offset and applies that same offset to all DLL base addresses. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>When the operating system loads, it applies <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/34807175/902497">a fixed random value to the DLL base</a>. … The ASLR doesn’t move DLL randomly. Without ASLR, if you get collisions, then you will get them with ASLR.  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If two DLLs have base addresses to designed to place them consecutively, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10114585/902497">they’ll still be consecutive even with ASLR</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p> In other words, the claim is that if you have two DLLs, call them DLL1 with base address <var>base1</var> and DLL2 with base address <var>base2</var>, then, assuming there are no base address collisions with already-loaded DLLs, ASLR will load the two DLLs at <var>base1</var> + <var>N</var> and <var>base2</var> + <var>N</var> for some value of <var>N</var> (possibly negative). In particular, this means that if <var>base1</var> and <var>base2</var> are adjacent, then the two DLLs will remain adjacent after ASLR, and if the two DLLs have colliding base addresses, then they will also have colliding base addresses after ASLR. </p>
<p>But it’s not true, and as far as I can tell, it has never been true. </p>
<p>ASLR chooses the base address pseudo-randomly, though it does take some of the original base addresses into account. For example, if the original base address was below the 4<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">GB</a> boundary, then the new pseudo-random base address will also be below the 4GB boundary. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t try to preserve relative base addresses. Each DLL is assigned a new pseudo-random base address independently. There is no correlation, or at least there is no conscious effort to correlate them. </p>
