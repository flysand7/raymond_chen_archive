<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the difference between WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
There are two window messages closely-associated with window
destruction,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowmessages/wm_destroy.asp">
the <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message</a>
and
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowmessages/wm_ncdestroy.asp">
the <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message</a>.
What’s the difference?
</p>
<p>
The difference is that
the <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message
is sent at the start of the window destruction sequence,
whereas the <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message is sent at the end.
This is an important distinction when you have child windows.
If you have a parent window with a child window,
then the message traffic (in the absence of weirdness)
will go like this:
</p>
<pre>
hwnd = parent, uMsg = WM_DESTROY
hwnd = child, uMsg = WM_DESTROY
hwnd = child, uMsg = WM_NCDESTROY
hwnd = parent, uMsg = WM_NCDESTROY
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the parent receives the <code>WM_DESTROY</code>
before the child windows are destroyed,
and it receives the <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> message after they have
been destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Having two destruction messages, one sent top-down and the other
bottom-up, means that you can perform clean-up appropriate to
a particular model when handling the corresponding message.
If there is something that must be cleaned up top-down, then you can
use the <code>WM_DESTROY</code> message, for example.
</p>
<p>
The <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> is the last message your window will
receive (in the absence of weirdness), and it is therefore the best
place to do “final cleanup”.
This is why
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/22/410773.aspx">
our new scratch program</a>
waits until <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> to destroy its instance
variables.
</p>
<p>
These two destruction messages are paired with the analogous
<code>WM_CREATE</code> and <code>WM_NCCREATE</code> messages.
Just as <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code> is the last message your window receives,
the <code>WM_NCCREATE</code> message is the first message,
so that’s a good place to create your instance variables.
Note also that
if you cause the <code>WM_NCCREATE</code> message to return failure,
then all you will get is <code>WM_NCDESTROY</code>;
there will be no <code>WM_DESTROY</code> since you never got the
corresponding <code>WM_CREATE</code>.
</p>
<p>
What’s this “absence of weirdness” I keep alluding to?
We’ll look at that

next time</a>.
