<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is the maximum size of the environment 32K or 64K?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There appears to be some confusion over whether the maximum size of the environment is 32K or 64K. Which is it?
 Both.</p>
<p> The limit is 32,767 Unicode characters, which equals 65,534 bytes. Call it 32K or 64K as you wish, but make sure you include the units in your statement if it isn’t clear from context. </p>
