<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does PostQuitMessage know which thread to post the quit message to?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter bav016 asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#534733"> how functions like <code>PostQuitMessage</code> and <code>SetTimer(NULL)</code> know which thread the messages should go to</a>. Unlike some functions such as <code>InvalidateRect</code> which have a window handle parameter that lets you say which window you want to operate on, <code>PostQuitMessage</code> and <code>SetTimer(NULL)</code> don’t say which thread the <code>WM_QUIT</code> or <code>WM_TIMER</code> message should go to. How do they decide?</p>
<p> The messages go to the current thread; that is, they are delivered to the thread that called the function in the first place. </p>
<p> There are many functions which operate on an implicit message queue, and those cases, they operate on the message queue associated with the thread making the call. If you call <code>GetKeyState</code> you retrieve the calling thread’s keyboard state. If you call <code>GetMessage</code> you retrieve messages from the calling thread’s message queue. If you call <code>InSendMessage</code>, you are told about the calling thread’s message processing state. If you call <code>GetQueueStatus</code> you retrieve information about the calling thread’s msesage queue. You get the idea. </p>
<p> If you want these functions to operate on a thread different from the one that is executing, you’ll have to ask that thread to make the call for you. </p>
