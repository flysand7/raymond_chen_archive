<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do DLGC_WANTALLKEYS and DLGC_WANTMESSAGE have the same value?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
From a purely theoretical point of view, there is only one “want” code
you really need: <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>.
All the others are just conveniences.
For example,
returning <code>DLGC_WANTARROWS</code> means
“I want this message if it is an arrow key; otherwise, I don’t care.”
It lets you write
</p>
<pre>
case WM_GETDLGCODE:
 return DLGC_WANTARROWS;
</pre>
<p>
instead of the more cumbersome (but equivalent)
</p>
<pre>
case WM_GETDLGCODE:
 if (lParam &amp;&amp;
     ((MSG*)lParam)-&gt;message == WM_KEYDOWN &amp;&amp;
     (wParam == VK_LEFT || wParam == VK_RIGHT ||
      wParam == VK_UP || wParam == VK_DOWN)) {
   return DLGC_WANTMESSAGE;
 }
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code> is equivalent to
returning <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> if the message is a press of the
tab key,
and
<code>DLGC_WANTCHARS</code> is equivalent to
returning <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> if the message is <code>WM_CHAR</code>.
</p>
<p>
And that leaves <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code>,
which is just another name for <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>:
</p>
<pre>
#define DLGC_WANTALLKEYS    0x0004
#define DLGC_WANTMESSAGE    0x0004
</pre>
<p>
They mean the same thing but look at the situation
through different perspectives.
The <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> value is more readable
if you return it as part of some larger decision-making process,
like we did with our mimicry of <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code>:
You do a bunch of tests and then when you decide, “I guess I want
this one,” you return <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>.
On the other hand,
the <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code> value is more readable
if you are just returning it unconditionally.
“I want all keys, no matter what it is.”
</p>
<p>
It’s like when you’re at the grocery store,
and the bagger asks you,
“Would you like me to help you carry your watermelon to your car?”
You can say “Yes” or “Always”; the result is the same.
The only difference is one of expectation: If you expect to
meet the same bagger in the future, and the bagger remembers,
then “Always” implies “You don’t need to ask me again.”
The dialog manager, on the other hand, doesn’t have that good of a memory,
and in fact, if you think about it, you <i>don’t want it to have a good
memory</i>.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the dialog manager remembered whether you said “Always”
and stopped asking you in the
future.<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">⊶</font>
It sends the <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message to a control,
the control responds <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code>,
and then later, you subclass the control and change the dialog code.
Oops, that doesn’t work because the dialog manager “remembered”
the control’s previous answer and doesn’t ask any
more.<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">⊷</font>
Naturally, you expect subclassing to work, so the dialog manager
asks each time.
</p>
<p>
Continuing the analogy, if you want the bagger to help you if it is
raining but not on a dry day,
you can either look out the window, confirm that it is not raining,
and say, “Yes”,
or you can just say, “Yes, if it’s raining,” regardless of the weather,
and let the bagger make the call.
(Of course, the analogy breaks down because the bagger might have a
different assessment from you as to whether or not it is raining.
The decisions you leave up to the dialog manager, such as whether a key
is the tab key or not, are much less ambiguous.)
</p>
<p>
Next time, we’ll look at a dialog manager problem,
and the information you learned today may come in handy in solving it.
