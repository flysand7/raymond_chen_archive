<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Where does the taskbar get grouped button titles from?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If the “Group similar taskbar buttons” box is checked (default)  and space starts to get tight on the taskbar, then  then the taskbar will group together buttons represending windows  from the same program and give them a common name.  Where does this common name come from?
  The name for grouped taskbar buttons comes from the version resource  of the underlying program.  You can view this directly by viewing  the properties of the executable program and looking on the Version  tab.</p>
<p>  To set this property for your own programs, attach a version resource  and set the name you want to display as the FileDescription property.  </p>
