<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the letter "T" in LPTSTR stand for?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The “T” in <code>LPTSTR</code> comes from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/21/61101.aspx#61728"> the “T” in <code>TCHAR</code></a>. I don’t know for certain, but it seems pretty likely that it stands for “text”. By comparison, the “W” in <code>WCHAR</code> probably comes from the C language standard, where it stands for “wide”.</p>
