<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does TranslateAccelerator do?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
For some reason, there appears to be some confusion over
what <code>TranslateAccelerator</code> does.
It’s very simple, and
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/ms646373.aspx">
it’s all spelled out in the documentation</a>.
You give it a message, and if the message is a keypress that
matches an entry in the accelerator table,
the corresponding <code>WM_COMMAND</code> or <code>WM_SYSCOMMAND</code>
message is sent to the window you said you are translating messages for.
</p>
<p>
One point of confusion is which window receives the translated
message.
Is it the window in the <code>MSG</code> structure or the window
passed as the first parameter to
<code>TranslateAccelerator</code>?
This confusion shouldn’t last long, though, because of the two options,
one of them raises more questions than it resolves.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If it went to the window in the <code>MSG</code> structure,
    then there would be no need for a
    <code>hWnd</code> parameter to
    <code>TranslateAccelerator</code>,
    since it wouldn’t be used for anything.
<li>If it went to the window in the <code>MSG</code> structure,
    there wouldn’t be much need to have a <code>TranslateAccelerator</code>
    function anyway, because even without it,
    the message would have gone to the window in the <code>MSG</code>
    structure anyway.
</li></li></ul>
<p>
If the message matches an accelerator,
the <code>WM_COMMAND</code> or <code>WM_SYSCOMMAND</code> message
goes to the window you passed as the first parameter to
<code>TranslateAccelerator</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once you understand this, you can answer the next question:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
My program has two dialogs containing tabs, both running on the
same UI thread.
I want to make sure that the Ctrl+Tab hotkey switches between the
tabs on the correct dialog.
I’ve already created an accelerator table,
but how do I decide which window to pass as the first parameter
to <code>TranslateAccelerator</code>?
Right now, I’m using <code>GetForegroundWindow()</code>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Well, first off, <code>GetForegroundWindow()</code> is completely
wrong, since the foreground window need not be one of your two
dialogs.
The user may be working with Notepad,
and now you sent a <code>WM_COMMAND</code> to Notepad with one
of your private command codes,
a command code that has a completely different meaning to Notepad.
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to the question.
How do you know which window to pass as the first parameter
to <code>TranslateAccelerator</code>?
Well, it’s the window that you want the <code>WM_COMMAND</code>
message to go to:
You want it to go to the dialog that contains the window
that the user typed Ctrl+Tab into.
You can determine this window by looking at the <code>MSG</code>
structure, since keyboard messages are delivered to the window
with keyboard focus.
</p>
<pre>
if (IsChild(hwnd1, msg.hwnd))
    TranslateAccelerator(hwnd1, hAccel, &amp;msg);
else if (IsChild(hwnd2, msg.hwnd))
    TranslateAccelerator(hwnd2, hAccel, &amp;msg);
</pre>
<p>
The window handle in the <code>MSG</code> structure tells
you which window the user typed the key into;
if that window is part of the first dialog,
then translate the message and send any translated message
to the first dialog.
Otherwise, check the same thing with the second dialog.
</p>
<p>
Easy as pie.</p>
