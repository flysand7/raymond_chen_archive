claims,
“If one validates parameters before using string functions
(which quality programmers should do),
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/08/10101773.aspx#10102139">
the ‘safe’ functions have no reason to exist</a>.”
</p>
<p>
Consider the following function:
</p>
<pre>
int SomeFunction(const char *s)
{
  char buffer[256];
  if (strlen(s) ≥ 256) return ERR;
  strcpy(buffer, s);
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
What could possibly go wrong?
You check the length of the string, and if it doesn’t fit
in the buffer, then you reject it.
Therefore, you claim, the <code>strcpy</code> is safe.
</p>
<p>
What could possibly go wrong is that the length of the string
can change between the time you check it and the time you use it.
</p>
<pre>
char attack[512] = "special string designed to trigger a "
                   "buffer overflow and attack your machine. [...]";
void Thread1()
{
 char c = attack[256];
 while (true) {
  attack[256] ^= c;
 }
}
void Thread2()
{
 while (true) {
  SomeFunction(attack);
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
The first thread changes the length of the string rapidly between
255 and 511, between a string that passes validation and a string that
doesn’t, and more specifically between a string that passes validation
and a string that, if it snuck through validation, would pwn the machine.
</p>
<p>
The second thread keeps handing this string to
<code>Some­Function</code>.
Eventually, the following race condition will be hit:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread 1 changes the length to 255.
<li>Thread 2 checks the length and when it reaches attack[256],
    it reads zero and concludes that the string length is
    less than 256.
<li>Thread 1 changes the length to 511.
<li>Thread 2 copies the string and when it reaches attack[256],
    it reads nonzero and keeps copying, thereby overflowing its buffer.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Oops, you just fell victim to the
Time-of-check-to-time-of-use attack
(commonly abbreviated TOCTTOU).
</p>
<p>
Now, the code above as-written is not technically a vulnerability
because
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/02/16/10101773.aspx">
you haven’t crossed a security boundary</a>.
The attack code and the vulnerable code are running under the same
security context.
To make this a true vulnerability, you need to have the attack code
running in a lower security context from the vulnerable code.
For example, if the threads were running user-mode code and
<code>Some­Function</code> is a kernel-mode function,
then you have a real vulnerability.
Of course, if <code>Some­Function</code> were at the boundary
between user-mode and kernel-mode, then it has other things
it needs to do, like verify that the memory is in fact readable
by the process.
</p>
<p>
A more interesting case where you cross a security boundary
is if the two threads are running code driven from an untrusted
source; for example, they might be threads in a script interpreter,
and the toggling of <code>attack[256]</code> is being done by
a function on a Web page.
</p>
<pre>
// this code is in some imaginary scripting language
var attack = new string("...");
procedure Thread1()
{
 var c = attack[256];
 while (true) attack[256] ^= c;
}
handler OnClick()
{
 new backgroundTask(Thread1);
 while (true) foo(attack);
}
</pre>
<p>
When the user clicks on the button, the script interpret
creates a background thread and starts toggling the
length of the string under the instructions of the script.
Meanwhile, the main thread calls <code>foo</code>
repeatedly.
And suppose the interpreter’s implementation of <code>foo</code>
goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
void interpret_foo(const function_args&amp; args)
{
 if (args.GetLength() != 1) wna("foo");
 if (args.GetArgType(0) != V_STRING) wta("foo", 0, V_STRING);
 char *s = args.PinArgString(0);
 SomeFunction(s);
 args.ReleasePin(0);
}
</pre>
<p>
The script interpreter has kindly converted the script
code into the equivalent native code, and now you have a problem.
Assuming the user doesn’t get impatient and click “Stop script”,
the script will eventually hit the race condition and cause
a buffer overflow in <code>Some­Function</code>.
</p>
<p>
And then you get to scramble a security hotfix.</p>
