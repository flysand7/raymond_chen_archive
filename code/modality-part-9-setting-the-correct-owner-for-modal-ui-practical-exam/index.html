<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Modality, part 9: Setting the correct owner for modal UI, practical exam</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Here’s a question that came from a customer.
You can answer it yourself based on what you know about modal UI.
(If you’re kind of rusty on the topic,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/Modality/default.aspx">
you can catch up here</a>.)
I’ve left in some irrelevant details
just to make things interesting.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
Our program launches a helper program
to display an Aero Wizard
to guide the user through submitting a service request.
</p>
<pre>
theWiz.DoModal(hwndMainFrame);
</pre>
<p>
There are no <code>EnableWindow</code> calls leading up to
or returning from this call.
the <code>DoModal</code> handles things nicely.
</p>
<p>
When the user clicks “Cancel” to cancel the service request,
we use a TaskDialog so we can get the new look for our confirmation
message box.
The task dialog setup goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
TASKDIALOGCONFIG config = { 0 };
config.cbSize = sizeof(config);
config.hwndParent = hwndMainFrame;
</pre>
<p>
When the user clicks “Yes” to cancel,
then another window instead of our frame becomes active.
</p>
<p>
On a hunch, I replaced the task dialog with a Win32 message box
</p>
<pre>
MessageBox(hwndMainFrame, ...);
</pre>
<p>
and bingo, we get the correct behavior.
When our wizard exits, the main frame receives focus.
</p>
<p>
I believe that the “automatic” modal behavior that comes
with <code>DoModal()</code> that takes care of disabling
and reenabling the main frame is somehow getting short-circuited
by using <code>TaskDialog</code> from inside our
<code>PSM_QUERYCANCEL</code> message handler.
</p>
<p>
Right now, we’ve switched to <code>MessageBox</code>,
but we would much prefer to use the task dialog.
</p>

Although it’s not common,
it is legal to have a window’s parent or owner
belongs to another thread or process.
But it definitely makes things a bit more tricky to manage
because it attaches the input queues of the two threads,
and you now have two threads coöperating to manage a single
window hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Is the cross-process window hierarchy a contributing factor
to the problem, or is it just a red herring?</p>
