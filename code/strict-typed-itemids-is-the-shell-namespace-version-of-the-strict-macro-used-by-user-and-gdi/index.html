<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">STRICT_TYPED_ITEMIDS is the shell namespace version of the STRICT macro used by USER and GDI</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Starting with the Windows Vista PlatformSDK, defining the symbol <code>STRICT_TYPED_ITEM­IDS</code> before including shell header files changes declarations that previously had simply used <code>ITEM­ID­LIST</code> now use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773321"> one of various types which are more clear about what type of ID list is being used</a>.</p>
<p> Think of it as the <code>STRICT</code> macro for the shell. </p>
<p> The more precise names emphasize the form of the ID list: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ITEM­ID_CHILD</code> represents an item ID     relative to some implied shell folder.     The item ID is followed by a null terminator     and is therefore exactly one <code>SH­ITEM­ID</code> long.     In file-system speak, this is a “file name.” </li>
<li><code>ID­LIST_RELATIVE</code> represents     an item ID list relative to some implied shell folder.     It can consist of any number of     <code>SH­ITEM­ID</code> structures concatenated     together, followed by a null terminator.     This item ID list must be used in conjunction with the     <code>IShell­Folder</code> it is associated with.     In file-system speak, this is a “relative path.” </li>
<li><code>ID­LIST_ABSOLUTE</code> represents     an item ID list relative to the desktop root folder.     It too can be any length.     This item ID list must be used in conjunction with the     <code>IShell­Folder</code> returned by     <code>SH­Get­Desktop­Folder</code>.     In file-system speak, this is a “fully-qualified absolute path.”     (An absolute ID list is the special case of a relative     ID list where the implied shell folder is the desktop root folder.) </li>
<li><code>ITEM­ID_CHILD_ARRAY</code> represents     an array of pointers to <code>ITEM­ID_CHILD</code>     objects, where all of the <code>ITEM­ID_CHILD</code>     objects are children of the same shell folder parent.     The array must be used in conjunction with that parent shell folder. </li>
</ul>
<p> These new types were introduced to help catch common programming errors when using the shell namespace. For example, if you try to pass an array of absolute pidls to <code>IShell­Folder::Get­UI­Object­Of</code>, you will get a type mismatch compiler error because that method takes an <code>ITEM­ID_CHILD_ARRAY</code>, and the thing you passed is not an array of <code>ITEM­ID_CHLD</code> pointers. </p>
<p> You are encouraged to turn on <i>strict mode</i> when compiling code that uses the shell namespace, but to preserve source code backward compatibility, the setting is off by default. </p>
