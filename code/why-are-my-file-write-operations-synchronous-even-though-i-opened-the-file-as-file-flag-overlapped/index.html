<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are my file write operations synchronous, even though I opened the file as <code>FILE_<code></code>FLAG_<code></code>OVERLAPPED</code>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer found that even though they opened a file with the <code>FILE_<code></code>FLAG_<code></code>OVERLAPPED</code>, their calls to <code>Write­File</code> were nevertheless synchronous. Why are their overlapped writes completing synchronously? </p>
<p>As currently implemented, there are at least <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/156932/asynchronous-disk-i-o-appears-as-synchronous-on-windows">three things which will cause a write to be forced synchronous</a>: </p>
<ol>
<li>Writing to an NTFS-compressed file.</li>
<li>Writing to an NTFS-encrypted file.</li>
<li>Extending a file.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two are easy to understand. The third is trickier. </p>
<p>You might think you can avoid extending the file with a write by seeking to the desired final file size, performing a <code>Set­End­Of­File</code>, seeking back to position 0, and then performing the desired write operations. </p>
<p>It turns out this doesn’t work because setting the end-of-file extends the logical file size, but the physical file size is unchanged. There are two obvious ways to change the physical file size: </p>
<p>First, you can use the <code>Set­File­Valid­Data</code> function. This allocates space for the file on disk but does not zero-initialize those bytes. You just get whatever garbage was lying in those sectors at the time. This is naturally a violation of security since it allows a user to access data that belonged to another user, so this operation requires <code>Se­Manage­Volume­Privilege</code> which is normally assigned only to administrators. </p>
<p>Less scary is seeking to the desired end of file position minus one, then writing one byte. This write will be synchronous, and it may take a while since the system needs to zero-initialize all the bytes in between, but it does finish with the desired state, and it doesn’t require administrator privileges. </p>
<p>Once you’ve caused the file to be extended to the desired size, you can seek back to position 0 and perform your overlapped write operations, which will now complete asynchronously, assuming you haven’t encountered any other obstacles. </p>
