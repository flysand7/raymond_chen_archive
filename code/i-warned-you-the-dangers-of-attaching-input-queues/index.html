<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I warned you: The dangers of attaching input queues</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Some people didn’t take to heart my cautions on the subject
of attached input queues, item number five on the list of
<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=116704">
five things every Win32 programmer should know</a>.
And then they find that their application stops responding.
</p>
<pre>
<i>// Code in italics is wrong
void TryToStealFocus(HWND hwnd)
{
  // First try plain SetForegroundWindow
  SetForegroundWindow(hwnd);
  HWND hwndFG = GetForegroundWindow();
  if (hwndFG == hwnd) return;</i></pre></p>
<p>  // That didn’t work – if the foreground window belongs
  // to another thread, attach to that thread and try again
  DWORD dwCurrentThread = GetCurrentThreadId();
  DWORD dwFGThread = GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwndFG, NULL);
  if (dwFGThread == dwCurrentThread) return;</p>
<p>  AttachThreadInput(dwCurrentThread, dwFGThread, TRUE);
  SetForegroundWindow(hwnd); // hangs here
  AttachThreadInput(dwCurrentThread, dwFGThread, FALSE);
}

<p>
Their customer feedback data shows that this function often
hangs at the second call to <code>SetForegroundWindow</code>.
My exercise for you is to explain why.
(Here’s

someone else with the same problem</a>.)
</p>
<p>
(Note that both of these customers are trying to circumvent
the foreground lock timeout so that they can steal focus and shove
a dialog box in the user’s face.)
