<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do we even have the DefWindowProc function?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Some time ago, I looked at two ways of reimplementing
the dialog procedure
(<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/12/55659.aspx">method 1</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/13/55662.aspx">
method 2</a>).
Commenter “8” wondered
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/25/583093.aspx#584521">
why we have a <code>DefWindowProc</code> function at all</a>.
Couldn’t window procedures have followed the dialog box model,
where they simply return <code>FALSE</code> to indicate that
they want default processing to occur?
Then there would be no need to export the <code>DefWindowProc</code>
function.
</p>
<p>
This overlooks one key pattern for derived classes:
Using the base class as a subroutine.
That pattern is what prompted people to ask for
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/12/55659.aspx">
dialog procedures that acted like window procedures</a>.
If you use the “Return <code>FALSE</code> to get default behavior”
pattern,
window procedures would go something like this:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL DialogLikeWndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 switch (uMsg) {
 ... handle messages and return TRUE ...
 }
 // We didn't have any special processing; do the default thing
 return FALSE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, subclassing in this hypothetical world would go like this:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL DialogLikeSubclass(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 switch (uMsg) {
 ... handle messages and return TRUE ...
 }
 // We didn't have any special processing; let the base class try
 CallDialogLikeWindowProc(PrevDialogLikeWndProc, hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
This works as long as what you want to do is override the base class
behavior entirely.
But what if you just want to augment it?
Calling the previous window procedure is analogous to calling the
base class implementation from a derived class,
and doing so is quite common in object-oriented programming,
where you want the derived class to behave “mostly” like the
base class.
Consider, for example, the case where we want to allow the user
to drag a window by grabbing anywhere in the client area:
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT CALLBACK CaptionDragWndProc(
    HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 LRESULT lres;
 switch (uMsg) {
 case WM_NCHITTEST:
  lres = DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
  if (lres == HTCLIENT) lres = HTCAPTION;
  return lres;
 ...
 }
 return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
We want our hit-testing to behave just like normal,
with the only exception that clicks in the client area
should be treated as clicks on the caption.
With the <code>DefWindowProc</code> model,
we can do this by calling <code>DefWindowProc</code> to
do the default processing, and then modifying
the result on the back end.
If we had use the dialog-box-like model,
there would have been no way to call the “default handler”
as a subroutine in order to make it to the heavy lifting.
We would be forced to do all the work or none of it.
</p>
<p>
Another avenue that an explicit <code>DefWindowProc</code>
function opens up is <strong>modifying</strong> messages
before they reach the default handler.
For example, suppose you have a read-only edit control,
but you want it to look like a normal edit control instead
of getting the static look.
You can do this by modifying the message that you pass
to <code>DefWindowProc</code>:
</p>
<pre>
...
 case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC:
  if (GET_WM_CTLCOLOR_HWND(wParam, lParam) == m_hwndEdit)
  {
   // give it the "edit" look
   return DefWindowProc(hwnd, WM_CTLCOLOREDIT, wParam, lParam);
  }
  ...
</pre>
<p>
Another common operation is changing one color attribute of an
edit control while leaving the others intact.
For this, you can use <code>DefWindowProc</code> as a subroutine
and then tweak the one attribute you want to customize.
</p>
<pre>
 case WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC:
  if (GET_WM_CTLCOLOR_HWND(wParam, lParam) == m_hwndDanger)
  {
   // Start with the default color attributes
   LRESULT lres = DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
   // Change text color to red; leave everything else the same
   SetTextColor(GET_WM_CTLCOLOR_HDC(wParam, lParam), RGB(255,0,0));
   return lres;
  }
  ...
</pre>
<p>
Getting these types of operations to work with the dialog box
model would be a significantly trickier undertaking.</p>
