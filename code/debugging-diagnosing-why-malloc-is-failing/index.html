<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Debugging: Diagnosing why malloc is failing</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had some code which was experiencing memory allocation failures when calling <code>malloc</code> (which maps to <code>Heap­Alloc</code>). The function returns <code>nullptr</code>, and <code>Get­Last­Error()</code> reports <code>ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY</code>. However, there was still plenty of memory free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task Manager reported working set at around 400MB,     with a peak of 550MB. </li>
<li>Using the <code>_heap­walk</code> function     to compute the total memory used resulted in about     380MB being reported. </li>
<li>The <code>_heap­chk</code> function reported     no errors. </li>
<li>The virtual memory size for the process was     a little bit more than the working set size. </li>
</ul>
<p> The customer was continuing their investigation but was looking for some pointers since the bug took a day to emerge. Could it be heap fragmentation? (The program is uses the regular C runtime heap and does not enable the low-fragmentation heap.)
 One of the suggestions was to run the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd535533.aspx"> VMMap</a> utility to see if the problem was exhaustion of virtual address space.
 And lo and behold, that was indeed the cause. The code had a bug where it was leaking threads. Since the default stack reservation for a thread is 1MB (although typically only a tiny fraction of that ends up being committed and even less being charged against working set), a slow accumulation of threads corresponds to a slow erosion of the virtual address space until you eventually run out.</p>
<p> Once again, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/28/10429807.aspx"> it’s the address space, stupid</a>. </p>
