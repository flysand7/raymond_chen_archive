<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What will GetLastError() return after a failed InitOnceExecuteOnce?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The documentation for <code>Init­Once­Execute­Once</code> says </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <b>Get­Last­Error</b>. </p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the documentation for the <code>Init­Once­Callback</code> says </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If the function returns <b>FALSE</b>, the block is not marked as initialized and the call to <b>Init­Once­Execute­Once</b> fails. To communicate additional error information, call <b>Set­Last­Error</b>. before returning <b>FALSE</b>. </p></blockquote>
<p>The second paragraph implies that the <code>Init­Once­Execute­Once</code> function does not itself call <code>Get­Last­Error</code>, because if it did, then that would wipe out the value set by the callback. Is that really the case? </p>
<p>Yes, that’s really the case. The remark in the first paragraph about calling <code>Get­Last­Error</code> presupposes that your callback uses <code>Get­Last­Error</code> to report why it wasn’t able to initialize. </p>
<p>I agree, however, that the documentation is misleading here. </p>
<p>But if your callback wants to return status information more complex than a single “success/failed”, you are probably better served by the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161222-00/?p=94995">synchronous two-phase initialization pattern</a>, which makes it a lot easier to return more complex information. You can even use it to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170406-00/?p=95915">throw a C++ exception</a>. </p>
