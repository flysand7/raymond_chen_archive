<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Internet Explorer not call DLL_PROCESS_DETACH on my DLL when I call ExitProcess?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer asked a question,
but as is often the case,
the question was much more telling than the answer.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We have an Internet Explorer plug-in which calls
<code>Exit­Process</code>
to force Internet Explorer to exit.
We found that when we do this, our plug-in does not receive a
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification.
What could be preventing our plug-in from receiving the
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As we saw some time ago when we looked at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/03/2383346.aspx">
the way processes shut down</a>
(plus
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/22/9951750.aspx">
an important follow-up</a>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/07/10221348.aspx">
or two</a>),
all a process has to do to thwart proper delivery of
<code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notifications is to do something
untoward during shutdown, at which point the kernel
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/06/8461730.aspx">
just gives up and calls <code>Terminate­Process</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
But like I said, the answer is much less interesting than the question.
What if the user had an unsaved email message at the time you decided
to exit Internet Explorer?
Recall that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/02/9931183.aspx">
plug-ins are a guest in the host process; don’t go changing the carpet</a>.
When we asked the customer why they were exiting Internet Explorer from
their plug-in, we received the explanation,
“The reason I am calling <code>Exit­Process</code>
is that I do not know another good way to exit Internet Explorer
from a plug-in.”
</p>
<p>
In this case, the guest is doing far more than just changing
the carpet.
The guest called in a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045HCJGC/?tag=tholneth-20">
demolition company</a>!
</p>
<p>
“Why did you call the demolition company to destroy my house?”<br/>
“I couldn’t think of a good way to destroy your house.”
</p>
<p>
The point isn’t that it’s bad to use a telephone call to hire a demolition
company to destroy somebody’s house and that you should use some other
method to contact them (like, say, a text message).
The point is that
<i>it’s bad to destroy somebody else’s house in the first place</i>.
</p>
<p>
Upon further investigation, the customer was writing a test
for their plug-in.
They open Internet Explorer and navigate to a page that uses
the plug-in.
When they are satisfied that the plug-in operated correctly,
they want to exit the copy of Internet Explorer in order to conclude
the test.
</p>
<p>
If you want to destroy a house, then destroy your own house.
Call
<code>Co­Create­Instance(CLSID_Internet­Explorer)</code>
to build a house,
navigate to your test page with
<code>IWeb­Browser2::Navigate</code>,
and when you’re done, you can destroy the house with
<code>IWeb­Browser2::Quit()</code>.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa752127.aspx">
There is sample code to do exactly this in the documentation for
the <code>IWeb­Browser2</code> interface</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The <code>IWeb­Browser2</code> interface is scriptable.
</p>
<pre>
var ie = new ActiveXObject("InternetExplorer.Application");
ie.Visible = true;
ie.Navigate("http://www.microsoft.com/");
WScript.Sleep(5000); // five seconds, say
ie.Quit();
</pre>
