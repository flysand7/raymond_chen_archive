<p>A customer observed that sometimes the Entry Point Not Found error dialog does not include the name of the missing entry point.</p>
<p>Usually, it looks like this:</p>

<p>But sometimes it looks like this:</p>

<p>Why does the error message sometimes leave out the name of the missing entry point?</p>
<p>If the entry point name is longer than 128 characters, then it is omitted from the error message. The most common reason for having a very long function name is that you exported decorated C++ functions, because C++ function decoration can result in very long names.</p>
