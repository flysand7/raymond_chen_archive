<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Functions that return GDI regions rarely actually return regions</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
For reasons I don’t quite understand,
the only functions in GDI and USER which create GDI regions
are the functions with <code>Create</code> in their name,
like
<code>Create­Rect­Rgn</code> or
<code>Create­Polygon­Rgn</code>.
All the other functions which return a region require you
to pass an existing region to use as the output.
</p>
<p>
I can see this being useful for
<code>Combine­Rgn</code>,
because you can set your output region to be equal
to one of the input regions in order to update a region
in place.
</p>
<pre>
// hrgnTotal |= hrgnSegment
CombineRgn(hrgnTotal, hrgnTotal, hrgnSegment, RGN_OR);
// hrgnTotal &amp;= hrgnClip
CombineRgn(hrgnTotal, hrgnTotal, hrgnClip, RGN_AND);
</pre>
<p>
But for all of the <code>Get</code> functions,
having to create an output region is usually just
an annoyance.
</p>
<pre>
// Create a dummy region - contents not important
HRGN hrgnClip = CreateRectRgn(0, 0, 0, 0);
// Ask for the clipping region to be copied to the dummy region
int status = GetClipRgn(hdc, hrgnClip);
</pre>
<p>
I guess it lets you reuse a single dummy region over and over
again, but in practice, you’re just going to destroy the region
when you’re done to free up the GDI region memory.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the historical reason for this, we’re stuck with it.
It may be an ugly pattern, but at least it’s a pattern.

<b>The things I do for you</b>:
I asked a colleague who worked on Windows 3.0
if he knew the reason for this design pattern.
He didn’t know but suggested that I ask another person
who retired from Microsoft many, many years ago.
Fortunately, I happened to have his email address even though we
aren’t really that close.
And the second person also didn’t know.
“This behavior was already in place when I joined the Windows 1.03 project.
Maybe you can ask
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/06/18/10321212.aspx">
Rao</a>.”
Unfortunately, I don’t have Rao’s email address,
so the trail ran cold.
But I burned a favor for you guys.</p>
