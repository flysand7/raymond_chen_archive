<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The gradual erosion of the SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX error mode</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag has a long history. </p>
<p>It goes back to 16-bit Windows and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">the way modules were loaded from floppy disks</a>. If the loader could not find the file it needed, it prompted you to insert the disk and gave you the option to retry or cancel. The <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag lets you disable the prompt and force the system to act as if you had selected <i>Cancel</i>. </p>
<p>The 16-bit kernel also exported a function called <code>Open­File</code> that lets you access the routine in the module loader that tries to open a file and prompts for retries if the file isn’t found. Therefore, the <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag controlled the <code>Open­File</code> function, too. </p>
<p>Forward to 32-bit Windows NT. The Windows NT module loader doesn’t work anything at all like the 16-bit module loader. Memory management is page-based rather than segment based. Images are memory-mapped and operate on page faults rather than being manually loaded from the disk and operating on segment faults (or worse, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120622-00/?p=7303">segment reload thunks</a>). </p>
<p>This means that the old model of prompting the user to reinsert the floppy disk makes no sense. There is never any prompting for failed module loads. The <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag has no effect for modules, which means that you won’t see any error boxes from <code>Load­Library</code> on Windows NT. (On Windows 95, if the DLL you were trying to load had a chain of dependencies that led to a missing 16-bit DLL, then you still got the error box from the 16-bit loader.) </p>
<p>This means that today, the <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag has no effect. </p>
<p>Well, almost. </p>
<p>Remember that <code>Open­File</code> function? The one that let you open a file using the same retry logic as the 16-bit module loader? The function was ported to 32-bit Windows, but of course it doesn’t actually use the 16-bit module loader. It just replicates the behavior of the 16-bit module loader. </p>
<p>Including the error prompt if the file cannot be found. </p>
<p>So that’s where we are today. The <code>SEM_NO­OPEN­FILE­ERROR­BOX</code> flag has been eroded away. The only place that still respects the flag is the old <code>Open­File</code> function, a function you probably didn’t even realize existed, and which exists only for backward compatibility with 16-bit programs. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: I submitted a documentation change request to MSDN to clarify this. We’ll see which happens first: This article gets posted or the MSDN change request gets processed. </p>
