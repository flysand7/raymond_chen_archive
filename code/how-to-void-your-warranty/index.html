<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to void your warranty</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>MSDN just published an article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/12/CriticalSections/">telling people that it’s okay to use reserved fields in an internal structure</a>. Anybody who does this has just voided their warranty. Please put a “This program has a  high likelihood of crashing after you install the next Service Pack or upgrade your OS” in your license agreement.</p>
<p>And you wonder why app compat is so hard.</p>
