<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On the importance of making sure WaitForInputIdle doesn’t think you’re idle, episode 1</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a program that was originally designed back when DDE ruled the land, and it continues to support DDE for (yup) backward compatibility. </p>
<p>Today and tomorrow are going to deal with DDE issues, but not because DDE is actually anything recommended. Quite the contrary: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070226-00/?p=27863">Please feel free to stop using DDE</a>. DDE is so obsolete that when somebody has a DDE question, it usually lands in the lap of some old-timer who starts the answer with “Kids these days…” and ends it with “I’m going to write a blog entry about this.” </p>
<p>Anyway, the customer was making some changes to the program’s splash screen, and one of the changes broke DDE. “With my change, launching a file from Explorer displays the dreaded <i>There was a problem sending the command to the program</i>. What should I be looking out for?” </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060621-17/?p=30793">Recall that</a> launching documents via DDE is done by first looking for a DDE server and if none is found, launching a server manually and trying again. And the retry occurs after the manually-launched server goes input idle; in other words, after the shell launches the server, the shell calls <code>Wait­For­Input­Idle</code>, and then when that call returns, the shell goes looking for the DDE server. If it can’t find the server the second time, you get the <i>There was a problem sending the command to the program</i> error. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100325-00/?p=14493">We saw earlier</a> that the <code>Wait­For­Input­Idle</code> function declares the process idle once any thread is “waiting for user input with no input pending.” In the customer’s case, the issue was not a background thread that went idle, but rather that their main UI thread was performing a <code>Co­Create­Instance</code> call to a local server. Cross-process method calls are performed by marshaling the request to the server, then waiting for the server to return a response. And in a single-threaded apartment, COM pumps messages while waiting. </p>
<p>It is that COM message pump that was causing the process to be marked idle. </p>
<p>The customer needs to get the DDE server window created and ready to accept incoming commands before the program does any cross-thread COM operations from a single-threaded apartment. </p>
<p>Okay, that was basically a warm-up. Next time, a different angle on failed DDE startup. </p>
