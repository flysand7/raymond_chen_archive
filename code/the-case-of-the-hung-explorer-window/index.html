<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the hung Explorer window</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A Windows Insider reported that Explorer stopped responding whenever they opened their Downloads folder. </p>
<p>We were able to obtain a memory dump during the hang, and observed that most threads were waiting for the loader lock. The loader lock was being held by this thread: </p>

<p>It should now be clear what the problem is. </p>
<p>On the second thread, GDI+ is shutting down because its last client decided to uninitialize it. (In this case, the last client was the system image list, which extracting the icon for a Store app, and Store app icons are PNG files, which is why GDI+ entered the picture.) </p>
<p>GDI+ is waiting for its worker thread to exit so it can finish cleaning up. </p>
<p>Just at this moment, the folder tree was populating itself on the first thread, and it found a third party shell extension. It dutifully loaded the third party shell extension (because that’s what shell extensions are for), and that shell extension, as part of its <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> tried to initialize GDI+. </p>
<p>Here comes the deadlock. </p>
<p>GDI+ was prepared for this possibility that somebody would try to initialize GDI+ while GDI+ was already in the process of shutting itself down. It solves this problem by making the shutdown run to completion (seeing as it already started), and then starting a new initialization pass. </p>
<p>That shutdown is waiting for a worker thread to finish up and exit. But the thread cannot exit until it sends out its <code>DLL_THREAD_DETACH</code> notifications. And since DLL notifications are serialized, the <code>DLL_THREAD_DETACH</code> cannot be sent until the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> completes. But the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> for the third party shell extension is waiting for GDI+. There’s our deadlock. </p>
<p>The root cause for this is that the third party shell extension is initializing GDI+ inside its <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>. This is already highly suspect even without any special insight into GDI+, and the suspicious are confirmed in the documentation for <code>GdiplusStartup</code>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Do not call <b>GdiplusStartup</b> or <b>GdiplusShutdown</b> in <code>DllMain</code> or in any function that is called by DllMain. </p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that the vendor who wrote this shell extension thinks that the rule doesn’t apply to them because they passed <code>SuppressBackgroundThread = true</code>, thinking that by removing the background thread, they successfully avoided any deadlocks with another thread. It didn’t occur to them that the other thread might not be the GDI+ background thread. </p>
<p>It also didn’t occur to them that GDI+ might <i>already be initialized</i> with a background thread. Furthermore, suppose the component that initialized GDI+ first (with a background thread) uninitialized GDI+ first. That call to <code>GdiplusShutdown</code> will not shut down GDI+ because there is still an outstanding client. And then when their DLL unloads, they call <code>GdiplusShutdown</code>, and that will cause a true shutdown of GDI+, which includes shutting down that background thread that they thought they had suppressed.¹ </p>
<p>So basically it was a bad idea all around. </p>
<p>I transferred this issue to the application compatibility team for outreach to the vendor, who happens to be a major corporation, so hopefully they can spare some developers to fix the deadlock. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Identifying the vendor was a bit tricky because of the extremely vague DLL name. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: When I originally composed the email with my analysis of the bug, I wrote <i>application compatibility outrage</i> instead of <i>application compatibility outreach</i>. Unfortunately, I caught the mistake before hitting Send. </p>
<p>¹Closer investigation shows that my guess was incorrect. The code that calls <code>GdiplusStartup</code> leaves the background thread enabled, so I have no idea how this ever worked in isolation. It “works” only because the calls to <code>GdiplusStartup</code> and <code>GdiplusShutdown</code> are no-op because somebody else initialized GDI+ first, and is still using GDI+ at the time they unload. </p>
