<p>
One of the cardinal rules of the <code>OVERLAPPED</code>
structure is <i>the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure
must remain valid until the I/O completes</i>.
The reason is that the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure
is
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/17/10106259.aspx">
manipulated by address rather than by value</a>.
</p>
<p>
The word <i>complete</i> here has a specific technical meaning.
It doesn’t mean “must remain valid until you are no longer interested
in the result of the I/O.”
It means that the structure must remain valid until
the I/O subsystem has signaled that the I/O operation
is finally over, that there is nothing left to do,
it has passed on:
You have an ex-I/O operation.
</p>
<p>
Note that
an I/O operation can complete successfully, or it can
complete unsuccessfully.
Completion is not the same as success.
</p>
<p>
A common mistake when performing overlapped I/O
is issuing a cancel and immediately freeing the <code>OVERLAPPED</code>
structure.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// this code is wrong
 HANDLE h = ...; // handle to file opened as FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED
 OVERLAPPED o;
 BYTE buffer[1024];
 InitializeOverlapped(&amp;o); // creates the event etc
 if (ReadFile(h, buffer, sizeof(buffer), NULL, &amp;o) ||
     GetLastError() == ERROR_IO_PENDING) {
  if (WaitForSingleObject(o.hEvent, 1000) != WAIT_OBJECT_0) {
   // took longer than 1 second - cancel it and give up
   CancelIo(h);
   return WAIT_TIMEOUT;
  }
  ... use the results ...
 }
 ...</i>
</pre>
<p>
The bug here is that after calling <code>Cancel­Io</code>,
the function returns without waiting for the <code>Read­File</code>
to complete.
Returning from the function
implicitly frees the automatic variable <code>o</code>.
When the <code>Read­File</code> finally completes, the I/O system
is now writing to stack memory that has been freed and is probably
being reused by another function.
The result is impossible to debug:
First of all, it’s a race condition between your code and the I/O
subsystem, and breaking into the debugger <i>doesn’t stop the
I/O subsystem</i>.
If you step through the code, you don’t see the corruption,
because the I/O completes <i>while you’re broken into the debugger</i>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what happens when the program is run outside the debugger:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ReadFile</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>I/O begins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WaitForSingleObject</td>
<td></td>
<td>I/O still in progress</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WaitForSingleObject times out</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CancelIo</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>I/O cancellation submitted to device driver</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>return</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>Device driver was busy reading from the hard drive<br/>
        Device driver receives the cancellation<br/>
        Device driver abandons the rest of the read operation<br/>
        Device driver reports that I/O has been canceled<br/>
        I/O subsystem writes <code>STATUS_CANCELED</code>
        to <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure<br/>
        I/O subsystem queues the completion function (if applicable)<br/>
        I/O subsystem signals the completion event (if applicable)<br/>
        I/O operation is now complete</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
When the I/O subsystem receives word from the device driver
that the cancellation has completed,
it performs the usual operations when an I/O operation completes:
It updates the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure with the results
of the I/O operation, and notifies whoever wanted to be notified
that the I/O is finished.
</p>
<p>
Notice that when it updates the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure,
it’s updating memory that has already been freed back to the stack,
which means that it’s corrupting the stack of whatever function
happens to be running right now.
(It’s even worse if you happened to catch it while it was in the
process of updating the <code>buffer</code>!)
Since the precise timing of I/O is unpredictable,
the program crashes with memory corruption that keeps changing
each time it happens.
</p>
<p>
If you try to debug the program, you get this:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ReadFile</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>I/O begins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WaitForSingleObject</td>
<td></td>
<td>I/O still in progress</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WaitForSingleObject times out</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Breakpoint hit on <code>Cancel­Io</code> statement<br/>
        Stops in debugger</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hit F10 to step over the CancelIo call</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>I/O cancellation submitted to device driver</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Breakpoint hit on <code>return</code> statement<br/>
        Stops in debugger</td>
</tr>

        Device driver abandons the rest of the read operation<br/>
        Device driver reports that I/O has been canceled<br/>
        I/O subsystem writes <code>STATUS_CANCELED</code>
        to <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure<br/>
        I/O subsystem queues the completion function (if applicable)<br/>
        I/O subsystem signals the completion event (if applicable)<br/>
        I/O operation is now complete</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Look at the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure in the debugger<br/>
        It says <code>STATUS_CANCELED</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hit F5 to resume execution<br/>
        No memory corruption</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Breaking into the debugger changed the timing of the I/O operation
relative to program execution.
Now, the I/O completes before the function returns,
and consequently there is no memory corruption.
You look at the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure and say,
“See? Immediately on return from the <code>Cancel­Io</code> function,
the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure has been updated with the result,
and the <code>buffer</code> contents are not being written to.
It’s safe to free them both now.
Therefore, this can’t be the source of my memory corruption bug.”
</p>
<p>
Except, of course, that it is.
</p>
<p>
This is even more crazily insidious because the <code>OVERLAPPED</code>
structure and the <code>buffer</code> are
updated by the I/O subsystem, which means that it happens
<i>from kernel mode</i>.
This means that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/09/8475735.aspx">
write breakpoints set by your debugger won’t fire</a>.
Even if you manage to narrow down the corruption to
“it happens somewhere in this function”,
your breakpoints will never see it as it happens.
You’re going to see that the value was good,
then a little while later, the value was bad,
and yet your write breakpoint never fired.
You’re then going to declare that the world has gone mad
and seriously consider a different line of work.
</p>
<p>
To fix this race condition,
you have to delay freeing the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure
and the associated <code>buffer</code>
until the I/O is complete and anything else that’s using them
has also given up their claim to it.
</p>
<pre>
   // took longer than 1 second - cancel it and give up
   CancelIo(h);
   <font color="blue">WaitForSingleObject(o.hEvent, INFINITE); // added
   // Alternatively: GetOverlappedResult(h, &amp;o, TRUE);</font>
   return WAIT_TIMEOUT;
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Wait­For­Single­Object</code> after the
<code>Cancel­Io</code>
waits for the I/O to complete
before finally returning (and implicitly freeing the <code>OVERLAPPED</code>
structure and the <code>buffer</code> on the stack).
Better would be to use
<code>GetOverlapped­Result</code>
with <code>bWait = TRUE</code>,
because that also handles the case where the <code>hEvent</code>
member of the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure is <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
If you retrieve the completion status
after canceling the I/O
(either by looking at the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure
directly or by using <code>GetOverlapped­Result</code>)
there’s a chance that the overlapped result
will be something other than <code>STATUS_CANCELED</code>
(or <code>ERROR_CANCELLED</code> if you prefer Win32 error codes).
Explain.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
If this example had used <code>Read­File­Ex</code>,
the proposed fix would be incomplete.
Explain and provide a fix.
Answer to come next time, and then we’ll look at another
version of this same principle.</p>
