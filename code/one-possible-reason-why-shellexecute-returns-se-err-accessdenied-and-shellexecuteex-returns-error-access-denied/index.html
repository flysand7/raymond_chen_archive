<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">One possible reason why ShellExecute returns SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED and ShellExecuteEx returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>(The strangely-phrased subject line is for search engine optimization.)
 A customer reported that when they called <code>ShellExecute</code>, the function sometimes fails with <code>SE_ERR_ACCESSDENIED</code>, depending on what they are trying to execute. (If they had tried <code>ShellExecuteEx</code> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/26/270710.aspx#270767"> they would have gotten the error <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code></a>.)
 After a good amount of back-and-forth examing file type registrations, a member of the development team had psychic insight to ask, “Are you calling it from an MTA?”
 “Yes,” the customer replied. “ShellExecute is being called from a dedicated MTA thread. Would that cause the failure?”
 Why yes, as a matter of fact, and it’s called out in the documentation for <code>ShellExecute</code>.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Because <b>ShellExecute</b> can delegate execution to Shell extensions (data sources, context menu handlers, verb implementations) that are activated using Component Object Model (COM), COM should be initialized before <b>ShellExecute</b> is called. Some Shell extensions require the COM single-threaded apartment (STA) type. </p></blockquote>
<p> As a general rule, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287087"> shell functions require STA</a>. Recall that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/24/8420242.aspx"> MTA implies no user interface</a>. If you try to use an apartment-threaded object from your MTA thread, a marshaller is required, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/13/281910.aspx"> if no such marshaller exists, the call fails</a>.</p>
<p> This also explains why the failure occurs only for certain file types: If handling the file type happens not to involve creating a COM object, then the MTA/STA mismatch situation never occurs. </p>
