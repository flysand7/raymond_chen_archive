<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I diagnose why my FreeLibrary isn’t freeing the library?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had some code that called <code>Free­Library</code>, and they expected the library to be freed, but it wasn’t happening. They suspect that there was an unmatched call to <code>Load­Library</code> and was wondering if there were any diagnostic tools that would help them find it. </p>
<p>Application Verifier to the rescue. </p>
<p>Application Verifier maintains a history of module loads and unloads, and you can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-avrf">the <code>!avrf -dlls</code></a> debugger extension to view that log. For each module that is loaded and unloaded, it records a stack trace of the <code>Load­Library</code> and <code>Free­Library</code>. </p>
<p>The customer reported back that this debugger extension found the problem. Their code used the <code>HKEY_</code><code>PERFORMANCE_</code><code>DATA</code> registry key to read some performance counters, and opening the performance counter was triggering an additional DLL load. </p>
