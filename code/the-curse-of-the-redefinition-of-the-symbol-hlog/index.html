<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The curse of the redefinition of the symbol HLOG</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was running into a compiler error complaining about redefinition of the symbol <code>HLOG</code>. </p>
<pre>
#include &lt;pdh.h&gt;
#include &lt;lm.h&gt;

...
</pre>
<p>The result is </p>
<pre>
lmerrlog.h(80): error C2373: 'HLOG' redefinition; different type modifiers
pdh.h(70): See declaration of 'HLOG'
</pre>
<p>“Our project uses both performance counters (<code>pdh.h</code>) and networking (<code>lm.h</code>). What can we do to avoid this conflict?” </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/07/9051091.aspx">We’ve seen this before</a>. The conflict arises from two problems. </p>
<p>First is hubris/lack of creativity. “My component does logging. I need a handle to a log. I will call it <code>HLOG</code> because (1) I can’t think of a better name, and/or (2) obviously I’m the only person who does logging. (Anybody else who wants to do logging should just quit their job now because it’s been done.)” </p>
<p>This wouldn’t normally be a problem except that Win32 uses a global namespace. This is necessary for annoying reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Not all Win32 languages support namespaces. 
<li>Even though C++ supports namespaces,     different C++ implementations decorate differently,     so there is no agreement on the external linkage.     (Indeed, the decoration can change from one version of the C++     compiler to another!) </li></li></ul>
<p>Fortunately, in the case of <code>HLOG</code>, the two teams noticed the collision and came to some sort of understanding. If you include them in the order </p>
<pre>
#include &lt;lm.h&gt;
#include &lt;pdh.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>then <code>pdh.h</code> detects that <code>lm.h</code> has already been included and avoids the conflicting definition. </p>
<pre>
#ifndef _LMHLOGDEFINED_
typedef PDH_HLOG     HLOG;
#endif
</pre>
<p>The PDH log is always accessible via the name <code>PDH_HLOG</code>. If <code>lm.h</code> was not also included, then the PDH log is also accessible under the name <code>HLOG</code>. </p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. </p>
