<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the difference between an asynchronous PIPE_WAIT pipe and a PIPE_NOWAIT pipe?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you operate on named pipes, you have a choice of opening them in <code>PIPE_WAIT</code> mode or <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> mode. When you read from a <code>PIPE_WAIT</code> pipe, the read blocks until data becomes available in the pipe. When you read from a <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> pipe, then the read completes immediately even if there is no data in the pipe. But how is this different from a <code>PIPE_WAIT</code> pipe opened in asynchronous mode by passing <code>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</code>?
 The difference is in when the I/O is deemed to have completed.
 When you issue an overlapped read against a <code>PIPE_WAIT</code> pipe, the call to <code>Read­File</code> returns immediately, but the completion actions do not occur until  there is data available in the pipe. (<i>Completion actions</i> are things like setting the event, running the completion routine, or queueing a completion to an I/O completion port.) On the other hand, when you issue a read against a <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> pipe, the call to <code>Read­File</code> returns immediately <i>with completion</i>—if the pipe is empty, the read completes with a read of zero bytes and the error <code>ERROR_NO_DATA</code>.
 Here’s a timeline, for people who prefer tables.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> If you use the <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> flag, then the only way to know whether there is data is to poll for it. There is no way to be notified when data becomes available.</p>
<p> As the documentation notes, <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> remains solely for compatibility with LAN Manager 2.0. Since the only way to use pipes created as <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> is to poll them, this is obviously not a recommended model for a multitasking operating system. </p>
