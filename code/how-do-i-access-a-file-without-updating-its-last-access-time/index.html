<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I access a file without updating its last-access time?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The first problem with discussing file last-access time is
agreeing what you mean by a file’s last-access time.
</p>
<p>
The file system folks have one definition of the file last-access time,
namely the time the file was most recently opened and either read from
or written to.
This is the value retrieved by functions like
<code>Get­File­Attributes­Ex</code>,
<code>Get­File­Time</code>,
and <code>Find­First­File</code>.
</p>
<p>
The problem with this definition is that it doesn’t match the
intuitive definition of last-access time, which is
“the last time <i>I</i> accessed the file,”
emphasis on the <i>I</i>.
In fact, the intuitive definition of access is more specific:
It’s
“the last time I opened, modified, printed, or otherwise performed
some sort of purposeful action on the file.”
</p>
<p>
This discrepancy between the file system definition and the intuitive
definition means that a lot of operations trigger a file system access
but shouldn’t count as an access from the user interface point of view.
Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing the file to generate a preview or thumbnail image.
<li>Accessing the file to
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/17/9426787.aspx#9430964">
    show its property sheet</a>.
<li>Accessing the file to retrieve its icon.
<li>Accessing the file to retrieve properties to show in Explorer
    or some other viewer.
<li>Accessing the file in order to back it up.
<li>Accessing the file in order to display its context menu,
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/03/10218997.aspx">
    something you aren’t supposed to be doing in the first place</a>
    but people
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/05/9903476.aspx#9904013">
    do it anyway</a>.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Whenever some shell extension violates this rule,
the shell team gets a bug report from some customer saying,
“The last-access time shown in Explorer is wrong.
A document which hasn’t been accessed in months shows a last-access
time of today.
After closer investigation, we found that the last-access time updates
whenever we
<i>insert seemingly-innocuous operation here</i>.”
</p>
<p>
If you’re writing a program which needs
to access the file contents but you not want to update
the last-access time, you can use the <code>Set­File­Time</code>
function
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms724933.aspx">
with the special value <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> in both members
of the <code>FILETIME</code> structure passed
as the last-access time</a>.
This magic value means “do not change the last-access time
even though I’m accessing the file.”
</p>
<pre>
BOOL DoNotUpdateLastAccessTime(HANDLE hFile)
{
 static const FILETIME ftLeaveUnchanged = { 0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF };
 return SetFileTime(hFile, NULL, &amp;ftLeaveUnchanged, NULL);
}
</pre>
<p>
As the documentation notes, you have to call this function
immediately after opening the file.
</p>
<p>
Going back to that linked comment:
The reason why viewing the Summary tab causes the last-access time
to be updated is that the Summary tab retrieves its information
by calling <code>Stg­Open­Storage</code>, and there’s no way to tell
that function,
“Hey, when you open the file in order to see if it has any
document properties, do that
<code>Do­Not­Update­Last­Access­Time</code>
thing so you don’t update the last access time.”
</p>

<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Starting in Windows Vista,
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/filecab/archive/2006/11/07/disabling-last-access-time-in-windows-vista-to-improve-ntfs-performance.aspx">
maintaining the last-access time is disabled by default</a>.
In practice, this means that the number of bugs related to
altering the last-access time accidentally will multiply unchecked,
because the mechanism for detecting the error is disabled by default.</p>
