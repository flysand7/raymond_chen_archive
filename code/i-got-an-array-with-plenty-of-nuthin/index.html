<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I got an array with plenty of nuthin'</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported a memory leak in the function
<code>PropVariantClear</code>:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
We found the following memory leak in the function
<code>PropVariantClear</code>.
Please fix it immediately because it causes our program to
run out of memory.
</p>
<p>
If the <code>PROPVARIANT</code>‘s type is <code>VT_ARRAY</code>,
then the corresponding <code>SAFEARRAY</code> is leaked and not
cleaned up.
</p>
<pre>
SAFEARRAY* psa = SafeArrayCreateVector(VT_UNKNOWN, 0, 1);
PROPVARIANT v;
v.vt = VT_ARRAY;
v.parray = psa;
PropVariantClear(&amp;v);
// The psa is leaked
</pre>
<p>
Right now, we are temporarily working around this in our program
by inserting code before all calls to
<code>PropVariantClear</code> to free the <code>SAFEARRAY</code>,
but this is clearly an unsatisfactory solution
because it will merely result in double-free bugs once you fix
the bug.
Please give this defect your highest priority as it is holding up
deployment of our system.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <code>VT_ARRAY</code> value is not a variant type in and of itself;
it is a type <i>modifier</i>.
There are other type modifiers, such as
<code>VT_VECTOR</code>
and <code>VT_BYREF</code>.
The thing about modifiers is that they need to <i>modify something</i>.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
The line
<code>v.vt = VT_ARRAY</code> is incorrect.
You have to say what you have a safe array <i>of</i>.
In this case, you want <code>v.vt = VT_ARRAY | VT_UNKNOWN</code>.
Once you change that, you’ll find the memory leak is fixed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The customer didn’t believe this explanation.
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
I find this doubtful for several reasons.
</p>
<ol>
<li>While this would explain why the
    <code>IUnknown</code>s in the <code>SAFEARRAY</code>
    are not released,
    it doesn’t explain why the <code>SAFEARRAY</code> itself is leaked.
<li>The <code>SAFEARRAY</code> already contains this information,
    so it should already know that destroying it entails releasing
    the <code>IUnknown</code> pointers.
<li>If I manually call <code>SafeArrayDestroy</code>,
    then the <code>IUnknown</code>s are correctly
    released, confirming point 2.
<li>The function <code>SafeArrayDestroy</code> is never called;
    that is the root cause of the problem.
</li></li></li></li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
The customer’s mental model of <code>PropVariantDestroy</code>
appeared to be that it should go something like this:
</p>
<pre>
if (pvt-&gt;vt &amp; VT_ARRAY) {
 switch (pvt-&gt;vt &amp; VT_TYPEMASK) {
 ...
 case VT_UNKNOWN:
  ... release the IUnknowns in the SAFEARRAY...
  break;
 ...
 }
 InternalFree(pvt-&gt;psa-&gt;pvData);
 InternalFree(pvt-&gt;psa);
 return S_OK;
}
</pre>
<p>
In fact what’s really going on is that the value of
<code>VT_ARRAY</code> is interpreted as
<code>VT_ARRAY | VT_EMPTY</code>,
because (1) <code>VT_ARRAY</code> is a modifier,
so it has to modify something, and (2) the
numeric value of zero happens to be equal to <code>VT_EMPTY</code>.
In other words, you told OLE automation that your <code>PROPVARIANT</code>
holds a <code>SAFEARRAY</code> filled with <code>VT_EMPTY</code>.
</p>
<p>
It also happens that a <code>SAFEARRAY</code> of <code>VT_EMPTY</code>
is illegal.
Only certain types can be placed in a <code>SAFEARRAY</code>,
and <code>VT_EMPTY</code> is not one of them.
</p>
<p>
The call to <code>PropVariantClear</code> was returning the
error
<code>DISP_E_BADVARTYPE</code>.
It was performing parameter validation and rejecting the property
variant as invalid,
because you can’t have an array of nothing.
The customer’s response to this explanation was very terse.

Tx. Interesting.
