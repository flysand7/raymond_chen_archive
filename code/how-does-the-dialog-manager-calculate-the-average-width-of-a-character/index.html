<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does the dialog manager calculate the average width of a character?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I explained that <a href="/code/why-isn-t-mapdialogrect-mapping-dialog-rectangles"> the <code>Map­Dialog­Rect</code> function requires the handle to a dialog box</a> because the mapping from dialog units to pixels is dependent upon the default font of the dialog box, so you need to know which dialog box you are converting.</p>
<p>I noted that if you don’t have a dialog box, and you don’t want to find or make one, then you can simulate the calculations yourself using the standard formulas:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="right">8 vertical dlu = </td>
<td>1 character tall</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">4 horizontal dlu = </td>
<td>1 average character wide</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>According to <a href="https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/145/Q145994/"> Knowledge Base article Q145994</a>, the calculation of the character height and width are performed as follows:</p>
<p>For height, call <code>GetTextMetrics</code> and use the <code>tmHeight</code>.</p>
<p>For average width, get the text extent of the string</p>
<pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
</pre>
<p>and divide it by 52, rounding to the nearest integer. Do not use the <code>tmAveCharWidth</code> from the text metrics. Despite its name, it is not the average of anything. It’s just the width of the character <tt>x</tt>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Maybe the font people interpreted it to mean “the width of an average character”, rather than “the average width of a character.”</p>
