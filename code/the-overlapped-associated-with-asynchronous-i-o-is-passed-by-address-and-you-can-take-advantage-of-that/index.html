<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The OVERLAPPED associated with asynchronous I/O is passed by address, and you can take advantage of that</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
When you issue asynchronous I/O,
the completion function or the I/O completion port receives,
among other things, a pointer to the <code>OVERLAPPED</code>
structure that the I/O was originally issued against.
And that is your key to golden riches.
</p>
<p>
If you need to associate information with the I/O operation,
there’s no obvious place to put it,
so some people end up doing things like maintaining a master
table which records all outstanding overlapped I/O as well
as the additional information associated with that I/O.
When each I/O
completes, they look up the I/O in the master table to locate that
additional information.
</p>
<p>
But it’s easier than that.
</p>
<p>
Since the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure is passed by address,
you can store your additional information <i>alongside</i> the
<code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure:
</p>
<pre>
// in C
struct OVERLAPPEDEX {
 OVERLAPPED o;
 CClient *AssociatedClient;
 CLIENTSTATE ClientState;
};
// or in C++
struct OVERLAPPEDEX : OVERLAPPED {
 CClient *AssociatedClient;
 CLIENTSTATE ClientState;
};
</pre>
<p>
When the I/O completes,
you can use the <code>CONTAINING_RECORD</code> macro
or just <code>static_cast</code> the <code>LPOVERLAPPED</code>
to <code>OVERLAPPEDEX*</code> and bingo, there’s your
extra information right there.
Of course, you have to know that the I/O that completed
is one that was issued against an <code>OVERLAPPEDEX</code>
structure instead of a plain <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure,
but there are ways of keeping track of that.
If you’re using a completion function, then only use an
<code>OVERLAPPEDEX</code>-aware completion function when
the <code>OVERLAPPED</code> structure is part of an
<code>OVERLAPPEDEX</code> structure.
If you’re using an I/O completion port, then you can use the
completion key or the <code>OVERLAPPED.hEvent</code> to
distinguish <code>OVERLAPPEDEX</code> asynchronous I/O
from boring <code>OVERLAPPED</code> I/O.</p>
