<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When should you use a sunken client area?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The  WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE extended window style allows you to create  a window whose client area is “sunken”.  When should you use  this style?
  The  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwue/html/welcome.asp">  Guidelines for User Interface Developers and Designers</a>  says in the section on  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwue/html/ch14c.asp">  the Design of Visual Elements</a> that  the sunken border should be used “to define the work area within a  window”.
  Specifically what this means is that a sunken client area indicates  that the window is a “container”.  So, for example, the Explorer contents pane gets a sunken client area  since a folder “contains” its elements.  Users expect to be able  to manipulate the items inside a container.  By contrast, a dialog box is not a container, so it doesn’t get  a sunken client area.</p>
<p>  At least those were the rules back in 1995.  Perhaps the rules have changed since then.  (Indeed I wouldn’t be surprised if they have.)  </p>
