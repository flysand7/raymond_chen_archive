<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are the C and C++ compilers giving me error messages about int when my code doesn’t mention int?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You’re trying to get your code to compile without errors, and you’re working through the error list, and then you get to some error message that complains about <code>int</code> when your code never mentions <code>int</code>:</p>
<pre>void f()
{
  const char* p = get_user_name();
}
</pre>
<p>The errors are</p>
<pre>test.cpp(3): error C2065: 'get_user_name' : undeclared identifier
</pre>
<p>Okay, I expected that one. Forgot to declare <code>const char* get_user_name();</code>. I know how to fix that: Add the declaration.</p>
<p>Now to the next error:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">test.cpp(3) : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'int' to 'const char *'
  Conversion from integral type to pointer type requires reinterpret_cast, C-style cast or function-style cast
</pre>
<p>What’s this about converting an <code>int</code> to a <code>const char *</code>? There are no <code>int</code>s in this code anywhere!</p>
<p>What you’re seeing is a cascade error. The compiler didn’t see any declaration for <code>get_user_name()</code>, so it had two choices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop the compilation right there.</li>
<li>Keep going to see if there are any more errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly all compilers go for the second option, because duh. But this means that the compiler needs to recover from its error state into some sort of valid state.</p>
<p>A popular choice for recovery is to assume that all undeclared variables are of type <code>int</code>, and all undeclared functions return <code>int</code>. This is probably for historical reasons, because in the original C language, there were a lot of places where if you didn’t specify a type, you got <code>int</code>. In particular, you could call a function without declaring it, and the function was assumed to return <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>In those cases, the compiler recovers by inserting the declaration</p>
<pre>extern int get_user_name();
</pre>
<p>and resuming. And that leads to the second error message: You’re trying to assign an <code>int</code> to a <code>const char *</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, that <code>int</code> is not your <code>int</code>. It’s the <code>int</code> that the compiler’s error recovery machinery manufactured out of nowhere in a futile attempt to get the compiler back on track.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the compiler is nice enough to tell you what its error recovery is doing, with a message like “undeclared identifier, assuming int.” But sometimes it just plows forward without telling you what recovery steps it took.</p>
<p>At some point¹ between Visual Studio 6 and 2017,² the Microsoft compiler changed the way it recovers from undefined identifiers. Instead of assuming that they are <code>int</code>, it treats them as a hypothetical type called <code>unknown-type</code>.</p>
<p>So if you see compiler errors about <code>unknown-type</code>, then it’s the same problem: The compiler encountered an earlier error and created some imaginary declarations to try to get itself back on track so it can report additional errors.</p>
<p>I hope at least that the name <code>unknown-type</code> makes it clearer what happened.</p>
<p>¹ I was too lazy to install every version of Visual Studio between 6 and 2017. You can get your refund at the counter over there.</p>
<p>² Depending on how you count, this means that it’s a range of 9 versions or 2011 versions.</p>
