<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Access to a file's attributes is controlled by two things</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/26/4052149.aspx"> some time ago</a> that permission to delete a file is granted either</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have <code>DELETE</code> access on the file, or </li>
<li>if you have <code>FILE_DELETE_CHILD</code>     access on the containing directory. </li>
</ul>
<p> File attributes behave in an analogous way.
 Permission to read a file’s attributes is granted either</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have <code>FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES</code> access on the file,     or </li>
<li>if you have <code>FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY</code>     access on the containing directory. </li>
</ul>
<p> If you want the file’s attributes, you could always get it by reading the directory, because one of the pieces of information you get from <code>Find­First­File</code> is the file attributes. Therefore, having permission to read a directory implicitly gives you permission to read the attributes of any file in that directory.</p>
<p> (Note, of course, that <i>write</i> permission on attributes is another story.) </p>
