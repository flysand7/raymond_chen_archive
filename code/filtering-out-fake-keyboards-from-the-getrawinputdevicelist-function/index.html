<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Filtering out fake keyboards from the GetRawInputDeviceList function</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, we used the <a href="/code/how-can-i-detect-whether-the-system-has-a-keyboard-attached-on-the-getrawinputdevicelist-function" title="How can I detect whether the system has a keyboard attached? On the GetRawInputDeviceList function"> <code>Get­Raw­Input­Device­List</code> to enumerate all the input devices</a>, with a focus on keyboards. You may notice that on some systems, the function reports a lot of phantom keyboards. What’s up with that?</p>
<p>The phantom keyboards are devices that report themselves to HID as keyboard devices, even though they aren’t keyboards in a traditional sense. They might be a separate numeric keypad, or buttons on the chassis for volume or brightness control that report themselves as keyboard keys. You can see all the keyboard devices in Device Manager under <i>Keyboards</i>, including the phantoms. Can we filter out the phantoms?</p>
<p>I don’t know, but I’m going to try.</p>
<pre>bool SmellsLikeARealKeyboard(HANDLE hDevice)
{
    RID_DEVICE_INFO info;
    UINT size = sizeof(info);
    UINT actualSize = GetRawInputDeviceInfoW(
        hDevice, RIDI_DEVICEINFO, &amp;info, &amp;size);
    if (actualSize == (UINT)-1 || actualSize &lt; sizeof(info))
    {
        // Weird failure.
        return false;
    }
    assert(info.dwType == RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD);
    return info.keyboard.dwNumberOfKeysTotal &gt;= 30;
}
</pre>
<p>I’m going to say that a keyboard device smells like a real keyboard if it has at least 30 keys. This will rule out most devices that pretend to be a keyboard just so they can provide a handful of hardware buttons. (There is also a field that gives the keyboard type, but I’ve found that to be largely useless. One of my real keyboards reports as <i>Unknown</i>, and I have a phantom keyboard that reports as <i>Generic 101</i>.)</p>
<p>We can use this function to try to filter out phantom keyboards:</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  auto devices = <a href="/code/how-can-i-detect-whether-the-system-has-a-keyboard-attached-on-the-getrawinputdevicelist-function" title="How can I detect whether the system has a keyboard attached? On the GetRawInputDeviceList function">GetRawInputDevices</a>();
  int mouseCount = 0;
  int keyboardCount = 0;
  int otherCount = 0;
  for (auto const&amp; device : devices) {
    switch (device.dwType)
    {
    case RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD:
      <span style="color: blue;">if (SmellsLikeARealKeyboard(device.hDevice))</span> {
        keyboardCount++;
      }
      break;
    case RIM_TYPEMOUSE: mouseCount++; break;
    default: otherCount++; break;
    }
  }
  printf("There are %d keyboards, %d mice, and %d other things\n",
         keyboardCount, mouseCount, otherCount);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>It helps a little. Some of the phantom keyboards disappear. But at least on my machine, there’s one phantom keyboard left: It describes itself as a <i>Virtual HID Framework (VHF) HID device</i>. This appears to be a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/virtual-hid-framework--vhf-"> facility for creating virtual devices</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know enough about Windows device management to find an easy way to filter out these virtual keyboards. Even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Input.KeyboardCapabilities.KeyboardPresent"> KeyboardCapabilities.KeyboardPresent</a> appears to be faked out by them. Maybe somebody can pick up the ball here.</p>
