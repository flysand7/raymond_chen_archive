<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The implementation of iterators in C# and its consequences (part 1)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/02/686456.aspx">
anonymous methods</a>,
iterators in C# are very complex syntactic sugar.
You could do it all yourself (after all, you <i>did</i> have to do
it all yourself in earlier versions of C#),
but the compiler transformation makes for much greater convenience.
</p>
<p>
The idea behind iterators is that they take a function with
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2006/03/08/546296.aspx">
<code>yield return</code></a>
statements
(and possible some <code>yield break</code> statements)
and convert it into a state machine.
When you <code>yield return</code>, the state of the function is
recorded, and execution resumes from that state the next time the
iterator is called upon to produce another object.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the basic idea:
All the local variables of the iterator (treating iterator parameters
as pre-initialized local variables, including the hidden <code>this</code>
parameter)
become member variables of a helper class.
The helper class also has an internal <i>state</i> member that keeps
track of where execution left off and an internal <i>current</i>
member that holds the object most recently enumerated.
</p>
<pre>
class MyClass {
 int limit = 0;
 public MyClass(int limit) { this.limit = limit; }</pre></p>
<p> public IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountFrom(int start)
 {
  for (int i = start; i &lt;= limit; i++) {
   yield return i;
  }
 }
}

<p>
The <code>CountFrom</code> method produces an integer
enumerator that spits out the integers starting at <code>start</code>
and continuing up to and including <code>limit</code>.
The compiler internally converts this enumerator into
something like this:
</p>
<pre>
 <font color="blue">class MyClass_Enumerator : IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; {
  int state$0 = 0;// internal member
  int current$0;  // internal member
  MyClass this$0; // implicit parameter to CountFrom
  int start;      // explicit parameter to CountFrom
  int i;          // local variable of CountFrom</font></pre></p>
<p>  public int Current {
   get { return current$0; }
  }</p>
<p>  public bool MoveNext()
  {
   switch (state$0) {
   case 0: goto resume$0;
   case 1: goto resume$1;
   case 2: return false;
   }</p>
<p> resume$0:;
   for (i = start; i &lt;= <font color="blue">this$0.</font>limit; i++) {
    <font color="blue">current$0 =</font> i;
    <font color="blue">state$0 = 1;
    return true;
 resume$1:;</font>
   }</p>
<p> <font color="blue">state$0 = 2;
   return false;
  }
  … other bookkeeping, not important here …
 }</font></p>
<p> public IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; CountFrom(int start)
 {
  <font color="blue">MyClass_Enumerator e = new MyClass_Enumerator();
  e.this$0 = this;
  e.start = start;
  return e;</font>
 }

<p>
The enumerator class is auto-generated by the compiler
and, as promised, it contains two internal members for the
state and current object,
plus a member for each parameter
(including the hidden <code>this</code> parameter),
plus a member for each local variable.
The <code>Current</code> property merely returns the current object.
All the real work happens in <code>MoveNext</code>.
</p>
<p>
To generate the <code>MoveNext</code> method, the compiler
takes the code you write and performs a few transformations.
First, all the references to variables and parameters need to
be adjusted since the code moved to a helper class.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> becomes <code>this$0</code>,
    because inside the rewritten function, <code>this</code>
    refers to the auto-generated class, not the original class.
<li><code>m</code> becomes <code>this$0.m</code> when
    <code>m</code> is a member of the original class
    (a member variable, member property, or member function).
    This rule is actually redundant with the previous rule,
    because writing the name of a
    class member <code>m</code> without a prefix is just
    shorthand for <code>this.m</code>.
<li><code>v</code> becomes <code>this.v</code> when
    <code>v</code> is a parameter or local variable.
    This rule is actually redundant, since writing <code>v</code>
    is the same as <code>this.v</code>, but I call it out
    explicitly so you’ll notice that the storage for the variable
    has changed.
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The compiler also has to deal with all those <code>yield return</code>
statements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>yield return x</code> becomes
<pre>
 current$0 = x;
 state$0 = n;
 return true;
resume$n:;
</pre>
<p>
where <code>n</code> is an increasing number starting at 1.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
And then there are the
<code>yield break</code> statements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>yield break</code> becomes
<pre>
 state$0 = n2;
 return false;
</pre>
where <code>n2</code> is one greater than the highest state
number used by all the <code>yield return</code> statements.
Don’t forget that there is also an implied <code>yield break</code>
at the end of the function.
</li></ul>
<p>
Finally, the compiler puts the big state dispatcher at the top of the
function.
</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of the function, insert
<pre>
switch (state$0) {
case 0: goto resume$0;
case 1: goto resume$1;
case 2: goto resume$2;
…
case n: goto resume$n;
case n2: return false;
}
</pre>
<p>
with one <code>case</code> statement for each state,
plus the initial zero state and the final <code>n2</code> state.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
Notice that this transformation is quite different from
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/31/344799.aspx">
the enumeration model we built based on coroutines and fibers</a>.
The C# method is far more efficient in terms of memory usage
since it doesn’t consume an entire stack (typically a megabyte in size)
like the fiber approach does.
Instead it just borrows the stack of the caller,
and anything that it needs to save across calls to <code>MoveNext</code>
are stored in a helper object (which goes on the heap rather than the stack).
This fake-out is normally quite effective—most
people don’t even realize that it’s happening—but there are places
where the difference is significant, and we’ll see that shortly.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>:
Why do we need to write
<code>state$0 = n2;</code> and add the
<code>case n2: return false;</code>?
Why can’t we just transform each <code>yield break</code>
into <code>return false;</code> and stop there?
