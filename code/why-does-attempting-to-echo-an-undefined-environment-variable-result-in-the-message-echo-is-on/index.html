<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does attempting to echo an undefined environment variable result in the message “ECHO is on”?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>From a batch file, suppose you try to echo the contents of a variable that hasn’t been defined: </p>
<pre>
set AWESOME=1
echo %AWESUM%
</pre>
<p>This prints <code>ECHO is off</code>. What’s up with that? </p>
<p>The first half of the puzzle is knowing that if a variable is not defined, then it expands to an empty string. Therefore, after expension, the command </p>
<pre>
echo %AWESUM%
</pre>
<p>becomes simply </p>
<pre>
echo
</pre>
<p>The second half of the puzzle is knowing that the <code>ECHO</code> command, if run with no command line, reports the current echo state, printing either <code>ECHO is on</code> or <code>ECHO is off</code>, accordingly. </p>
<p>Putting it all together: If you try to echo the value of an undefined variable, and the variable is not defined, then the echo command gets a blank command line, at which point it reports its current state. </p>
<p>So how do you echo the value of a variable that might be undefined? </p>
<p>One way is to put something else on the command line. </p>
<pre>
echo AWESUM=%AWESUM%
</pre>
<p>If <code>AWESUM</code> is not defined, this will expand to </p>
<pre>
echo AWESUM=
</pre>
<p>and that prints <code>AWESUM=</code>. </p>
<p>Okay, but what if you really want to echo the value on a line all by itself? </p>
<p>You can exploit a quirk of the <code>ECHO</code> command: If you follow the word <code>ECHO</code> immediately with a period (no space), then the period is not echoed, but the presence of the period suppresses the “no command line” behavior, and you get a blank line. </p>
<pre>
ECHO.
</pre>
<p>That prints a blank line. </p>
<p>If you want to print a variable that might not be defined, you would say </p>
<pre>
ECHO.%AWESUM%
</pre>
<p>This quirk of the <code>ECHO</code> command was originally a bug in the command line parser, but once people discovered it, the bug became elevated to a feature. (The phenomenon of a bug elevated to a feature <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130710-00/?p=3843">happens</a> <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110825-00/?p=9803">a lot</a>. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">Obligatory XKCD</a>.) </p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Explain the output of this batch file, and how would you fix it so it prints <code>/?</code>? </p>
<pre>
set message=/?
echo %message%
</pre>
