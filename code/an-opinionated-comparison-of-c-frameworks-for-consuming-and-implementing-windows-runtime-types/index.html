<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An opinionated comparison of C++ frameworks for consuming and implementing Windows Runtime types</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There are three leading C++ frameworks for consuming and implementing Windows Runtime types. The current recommendation (as of this writing) is C++/WinRT.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>¹ C++/WinRT contains a large number of types and template specializations, which slows down the compiler. The precompiled header file easily exceeds 1GB in size. You can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/macros"> define <code>WINRT_<wbr/>LEAN_<wbr/>AND_<wbr/>MEAN</code></a> to remove rarely-used features and improve compile times.</p>
<p>² Automatic generation of the IDL file is a two-edged sword. Although it saves a lot of effort, it can also get in the way: If you need to make a runtime class object marshallable, you need to register a marshaller for the autogenerated interface, which will have an ugly autogenerated name, and whose UUID may not be stable. Autogeneration also conflicts with versioning, makes it harder to interop with other languages, and it can result in puzzling behavior if you don’t understand how the autogeneration works. Furthermore, the autogenerated interface names do not follow Windows Runtime naming conventions.</p>
<p>³ Static class constructors allow class statics to be delay-initialized. This is significant because running constructors at <code>DLL_<wbr/>PROCESS_<wbr/>ATTACH</code> creates the risk of deadlocks and other unfortunate behaviors. C++/CX clients must work around this by having a static <code>Initialize­Statics()</code> method which initializes the statics (e.g., dependency properties) and calling it at an opportune moment.</p>
<p>⁴ <a href="/code/the-com-static-store-part-1-introduction"> COM static lifetime</a> allows you to register an object in the COM static lifetime store, which allows you to (1) obtain it later, and (2) destruct it automatically when COM is uninitialized. The former provides a persistent-lifetime object for things like global event sources. The latter permits the object’s destructors to run while COM is still initialized.</p>
<p>⁵ Default is normally free-threaded, but if <code>BUILD_<wbr/>WINDOWS</code> is set, then default is single-threaded.</p>
<p>⁶ PPL coroutine support is very large.</p>
