<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you're waiting for I/O to complete, it helps if you actually have an I/O to begin with</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We saw earlier
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/03/10124060.aspx">
the importance of waiting for I/O to complete before
freeing the data structures associated with that I/O</a>.
On the other hand, before you start waiting, you have to make
sure that you have something to wait <i>for</i>.
</p>
<p>
A customer reported a hang in <code>Get­Overlapped­Result</code>
waiting for an I/O to cancel, and the
I/O team was brought in to investigate.
They looked at the I/O stack and found that the I/O the customer
was waiting for was no longer active.
The I/O people considered a few possibilities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The I/O was active at one point, but when it completed,
    a driver bug prevented the completion event from being signaled.
</li>
<li>The I/O was active at one point, and the I/O completed,
    but the program inadvertently called <code>Reset­Event</code>
    on the handle, negating the <code>Set­Event</code> performed
    by the I/O subsystem.
</li>
<li>The I/O was never active in the first place.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These possibilities are in increasing order of likelihood
(and, perhaps not coincidentally,
decreasing order of relevance to the I/O team).
</p>
<p>
A closer investigation of the customer’s code showed a code path
in which the <code>Read­File</code> call was bypassed.
When the bypass code path rejoined the mainline code path,
the code continued its work for a while, and then if it decided
that it was tired of waiting for the read to complete, it
performed a <code>Cancel­Io</code> followed by a
<code>Get­Overlapped­Result</code> to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/02/10123392.aspx">
wait for the cancellation to complete</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you never issue the I/O, then a wait for the I/O to complete
will wait forever,
since you’re waiting for something that will never happen.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so maybe this was a dope-slap type of bug.
But here’s something perhaps a little less self-evident:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// there is a flaw in this code - see discussion
// assume operating on a FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED file
if (ReadFile(h, ..., &amp;overlapped)) {
 // I/O completed synchronously, as we learned earlier
} else {
 // I/O under way
 ... do stuff ...
 // okay, let's wait for that I/O
 GetOverlappedResult(h, &amp;overlapped, &amp;dwRead, TRUE);
 ...
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Get­Overlapped­Result</code> call can hang here
because the comment “I/O is under way” is overly optimistic:
The I/O may never even have gotten started.
If it never started, then it will never complete either.
You cannot assume that a <code>FALSE</code> return from
<code>Read­File</code> implies that the I/O is under way.
You also have to check that <code>Get­Last­Error()</code>
returns <code>ERROR_IO_PENDING</code>.
Otherwise, the I/O failed to start, and you shouldn’t wait for it.
