<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I test my geolocation code on a system without a GPS?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>After you put your Windows system into Developer Mode, you have the opportunity to turn on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal"> Windows Device Portal</a> Web server.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal-api-core"> The Windows Device Portal REST API</a> gives you a way to control various parts of the system remotely. And the one that’s interesting for today’s topic is the REST API for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal-api-core#location"> injecting artificial GPS data</a>. After sending the REST command to enable GPS overrides, you can use subsequent REST commands to inject a specific latitude and longitude into the system’s geolocator.</p>
<p>Now you can test geolocation on your development machine without having to drag it on a cart around the building. On the other hand, it also means you lost one justification for needing to take a trip to a tropical island “to test that the program correctly detects a change in location to a tropical island.”</p>
