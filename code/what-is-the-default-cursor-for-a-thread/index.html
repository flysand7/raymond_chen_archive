<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the default cursor for a thread?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
When we looked at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/21/1115695.aspx">
the process by which the cursor is set</a>,
we neglected to discuss the case where
<i>nobody bothers to set the cursor</i>.
What is the ultimate default cursor?
</p>
<p>
Let’s write a program that refuses to set the cursor.
Take
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
the scratch program</a>
and add these lines:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL OnSetCursor(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndCursor,
                 UINT codeHitTest, UINT msg)
{
  return TRUE;
}
   HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_SETCURSOR, OnSetCursor);
</pre>
<p>
What we did was make the window explicitly refuse to set
the cursor by making it do nothing and return <code>TRUE</code>,
which means,
“It’s all good. I set the cursor!”
(Liar, liar, pants on fire.)
</p>
<p>
Run this program, move the cursor over the window, and what do you get?
</p>
<p>
The hourglass.
</p>
<p>
Now, this is clearly some sort of pathological case,
where there is a thread that covers its ears and hums
whenever the window manager asks it to specify
a cursor.
But you can end up in this case unintentionally,
and in fact there’s a good chance that you’ve seen it happen.
Just write an application that blocks the UI thread during startup.
Take a fresh scratch program and add a different line of code:
</p>
<pre>
        ShowWindow(hwnd, nShowCmd);
        <font color="blue">Sleep(5000);</font>
        while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
            TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
            DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
        }
</pre>
<p>
Here, we’re simulating a program that hangs its UI thread
during initialization.
During that initial five-second delay,
the program has yet to pump any messages,
so it hasn’t yet received the
<code>WM_MOUSE­MOVE</code> or
<code>WM_NC­MOUSE­MOVE</code>
message
that would normally trigger the
<code>WM_SET­CURSOR</code> message.
All the window manager can do is show the default cursor.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the default cursor is an hourglass.</p>
