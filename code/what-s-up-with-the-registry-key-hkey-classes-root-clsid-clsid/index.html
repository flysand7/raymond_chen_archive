<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s up with the registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\CLSID?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>While I was <a href="/other/cheap-amusement-searching-for-spelling-errors-in-the-registry" title="Cheap amusement: Searching for spelling errors in the registry"> looking for spelling errors in the registry</a>, I ran across the strange registry key <code>HKEY_<wbr/>CLASSES_<wbr/>ROOT\<wbr/>CLSID\<wbr/>CLSID</code>, which has as its default value the stringified GUID <code>{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</code>. I asked the COM folks what the deal was with that.</p>
<p>They explained, “It’s the progid for the class moniker.”</p>
<p>That was enough to push me in the right direction, and it made my brain explode from the meta-ness of it all. Sort of like when you study Category Theory in math class.</p>
<p>If you want to connect a COM class ID with a programmatic ID, you cross-link them like this:</p>
<pre>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">{clsid}</span>\ProgId]
@="<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">progid</span>"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">progid</span>\CLSID]
@="<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">{clsid}</span>"
</pre>
<p>The class ID is a child of <code>HKEY_<wbr/>CLASSES_<wbr/>ROOT\<wbr/>CLSID</code>, and it in turn has a <code>ProgId</code> subkey whose value is the programmatic ID. Meanwhile, the programmatic ID is a child of <code>HKEY_<wbr/>CLASSES_<wbr/>ROOT</code>, and it in turn has a <code>CLSID</code> subkey whose value is the class ID.</p>
<p>Here’s where things get weird: The programmatic ID for the class moniker is <code>CLSID</code>.</p>
<p>Plug that into the above formula, and you get</p>
<pre>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</span>\ProgId]
@="<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">CLSID</span>"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">CLSID</span>\CLSID]
@="<span style="border: solid .75pt black;">{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</span>"
</pre>
<p>So it’s all legit. It just looks weird.</p>
<p>It’s like that trick on the 80386 where you set a page directory entry to point back to the page directory itself, thereby allowing you to <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg"> access page tables through the page table</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: It frustrates me when I answer a question by merely giving a push in the right direction, and the person doesn’t realize that it was a helpful push and just comes back looking for more hand-holding. I try not to be that person.</p>
