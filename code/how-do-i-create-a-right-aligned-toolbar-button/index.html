<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I create a right-aligned toolbar button?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I didn’t think this was all that common a request, but it came in twice from two different customers, so I guess there are still people creating toolbars, and creating them with right-aligned buttons (even though it violates Windows user interface guidelines, though I can’t find a citation right now).
 You may have noticed that the toolbar common control doesn’t provide a facility for creating right-aligned buttons. Partly because it’s a violation of the guidelines anyway, but mostly because the default state of every feature is “not implemented.” <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/53298.aspx"> Adding a feature requires work</a>, and since there is only a finite amount of work available to apply, you have to decide where to spend it. And generally speaking, you don’t <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/19/3945339.aspx"> focus your efforts on helping people violate the guidelines</a>.</p>
<p> If you want to create a right-aligned toolbar button, you can cobble one together by combining things you already have. I can think of two ways of doing this off the top of my head. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create two toolbars, one for the left-aligned buttons and     one for the right-aligned buttons, then size and position     them appropriately. </li>
<li>Create a separator between the left-aligned buttons and     the right-aligned buttons, and set the separator size appropriately. </li>
</ul>
<p> Which comes to a third reason why there is no feature for right-aligned toolbar buttons: Because you can already do it yourself without too much effort. </p>
