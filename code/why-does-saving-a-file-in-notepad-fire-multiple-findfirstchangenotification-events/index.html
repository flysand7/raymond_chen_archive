<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does saving a file in Notepad fire multiple FindFirstChangeNotification events?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many people have noticed that the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> and <code>Find­First­Change­Notification</code> functions (and therefore their BCL equivalent <code>File­System­Watcher</code> and WinRT equivalent <code>Storage­Folder­Query­Result</code>) fire multiple <code>FILE_ACTION_MODIFIED</code> events when you save a file in Notepad. Why is that?
 Because multiple things were modified.
 Notepad opens the file for writing, writes the new data, calls <code>Set­End­Of­File</code> to truncate any excess data (in case the new file is shorter than the old file), then closes the handle. Two things definitely changed, and a third thing might have changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The file last-modified time definitely changed. </li>
<li>The file size definitely changed. </li>
<li>The file last-access time might have changed. </li>
</ul>
<p> It’s therefore not surprising that you got two events, possibly three.
 Remember <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/12/10195186.aspx"> the original design goals of the <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> function</a>: It’s for letting an application cache a directory listing and update it incrementally. Given these design goals, filtering out redundant notifications in the kernel is not required aside from the performance benefits of reduced chatter. In theory, <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> could report a spurious change every 5 seconds, and the target audience for the function would still function correctly (albeit suboptimally).
 Given this intended usage pattern, any consumer of <code>Read­Directory­ChangesW</code> needs to accept that any notifications you receive encompass the minimum information you require in order to keep your cached directory information up to date, but it can contain <i>extra</i> information, too. If you want to respond only to actual changes, you need to compare the new file attributes against the old ones.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Actually, the two things that changed when Notepad set the file size are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545855(v=vs.85).aspx"> the allocation size and the file size</a> (which you can think of as the physical and logical file sizes, respectively). Internally, this is done by two separate calls into the I/O manager, so it generates two change notifications. </p>
