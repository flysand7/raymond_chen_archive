<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the longjmp from nowhere trying to open a registry key</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The crash telemetry team brought our attention to a bug a few weeks before the Creators Update was supposed to be released, and based on the high hit count of 3 million crashes in the past 30 days, the bug was marked “Blocking engineering sign-off”. </p>
<p>Life is always exciting when you get a “Blocking engineering sign-off” bug. </p>
<p>Here’s the relevant excerpt from the crashing stack. Let’s see what we can make of it: </p>

<p>Working upward, the storage system is trying to read the machine GUID, so it’s opening the <code>HKEY_</code><code>LOCAL_</code><code>MACHINE\</code><code>Software\</code><code>Microsoft\</code><code>Cryptography</code> registry key. That <code>Reg­Open­Key­ExW</code> call eventually reached the kernel at <code>Zw­Open­Key­Ex</code>, and then somehow a user-mode asynchronous procedure call (APC) got dispatched back into the user-mode thread. That user APC executed a lot of code that got injected into the process, not associated with a DLL. It reached a point where it encountered an exception, and the operating system is trying to unwind the exception but something goes wrong with the unwind when it wants to check a long jump target: The jump target is not valid, so the process crashes with a fail-fast exception: Incorrect exception unwind information is not a recoverable error, and it may indicate the presence of malware. </p>
<p>There are multiple levels of mystery here. The first level of mystery is this chunk of code not associated with a DLL. How did it get into our process? This particular process was <code>Runtime­Broker.exe</code>, which isn’t as promiscuous as <code>explorer.exe</code> with respect to shell extensions and other third-party extension points, nor is it a common target for code injection. </p>
<p>Second, why is opening a registry key dispatching user-mode APCs? This is not called out in the documentation, and it is not something expected in general. Dispatching user-model APCs is not something you do just for fun. It creates a situation where code is running inside the context of unrelated code. If a critical section was held at the time <code>Reg­Open­Key­ExW</code> was called, that critical sction is still being held when the APC is run, and you are now in danger of creating a deadlock. This is why functions which processes APCs usually make you opt into APCs explicitly: <code>SleepEx</code>, <code>Wait­For­Single­Object­Ex</code>, and <code>Msg­Wait­For­Multiple­Objects­Ex</code> don’t process APCs unless you say you want them to, and the non-<code>Ex</code> versions never process APCs. </p>
<p>The third mystery is why the injected code is performing a <code>longjmp</code>. The exception being propagated is <code>0x80000026</code> which is <code>STATUS_</code><code>LONGJUMP</code>: “A long jump has been executed.” </p>
<p>The mystery code is trying to perform a <code>longjmp</code>. Thats right, a <code>longjmp</code>. Apparently we are still running code written in 1970. </p>
<p>We contacted the registry team for assistance, and they recognized this issue. They suspect that some third-party registry filter driver (perhaps a game’s anti-cheat software) is monitoring attempts to access any registry keys under <code>HKEY_</code><code>LOCAL_</code><code>MACHINE\</code><code>Software\</code><code>Microsoft\</code><code>Cryptography</code> and scheduling user-mode APCs as part of its processing. That APC then runs into a situation where it decides to try to <code>longjmp</code> out of its normal processing, but the <code>longjmp</code> buffer is either corrupted, or the long jump target has not been registered as a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt637065(v=vs.85).aspx">control flow guard</a> jump target, so the exception dispatching code says, “No way, I’m not dispatching this exception.” </p>
<p>The registry team noted that the vast majority of the crashes are coming from machines running the Anniversary Update, not the Creators Update, so this likely not a case of the Creators Update making a change that exacerbated a pre-existing problem, and the “Blocking engineering sign-off” marking should be removed. Furthermore, even though there were three million hits over the past 30 days, the crashes were not uniformly-distributed. Rather, the issue spiked and then died down within a week. This suggests that the third party recognized the issue and put out their own fix. </p>
