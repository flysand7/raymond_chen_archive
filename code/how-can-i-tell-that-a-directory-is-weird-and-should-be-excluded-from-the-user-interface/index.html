Last time, we looked at a customer who wanted to know how to tell
whether a given folder was a Recycle Bin folder or not.
We answered the question as stated,
but made the mistake of not looking
at the problem the customer was trying to solve.

I need to know which folders are Recycle Bin folders so I can
skip over them when searching the drive for content.

Ah, the real question isn’t “How can I tell whether a directory
is a Recycle Bin folder?” but rather
“How can I tell whether a directory contains weird stuff that
we shouldn’t be showing to the user (of which Recycle Bin files
are just one example)?”
</p>
<p>
The way to mark a folder as containing stuff that you shouldn’t
bother the user with is to set both the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN</code>
and <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM</code> attributes.
In addition to Recycle Bin directories, this also prevents you
from searching weird things like System Restore points.
(Though for some reason it doesn’t stop you from searching
Temporary Internet Files; I don’t know whether that is a bug or a feature.)

Therefore, the answer to “How can I tell whether a directory
contains weird stuff that we shouldn’t be showing to the user?”
is to test for the hidden and system attributes.

BOOL IsWeirdDirectory(LPCTSTR pszDir)
{
  DWORD dwAttr = GetFileAttributes(pszDir);
  return dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES &amp;&amp;
         ((dwAttr &amp; (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN))
                 == (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN));
}
</pre></p>
