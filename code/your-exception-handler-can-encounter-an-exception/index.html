<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Your exception handler can encounter an exception</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Consider the following code,
written in C# just for kicks; the problem is generic to any
environment that supports exception handling.
</p>
<pre>
void ObliterateDocument()
{
 try {
  try {
   document.DestroyAll();
  } finally {
   document.Close();
   document.DestroyExtensions();
   document.DestroyPlugins();
  }
 } finally {
  document.Destroy();
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Some time later, you find yourself facing an assertion
failure from <code>document.Destroy()</code> claiming that you are
destroying the document while there are still active plugins.
But there is your call to <code>document.DestroyPlugins()</code>,
and it’s in a <code>finally</code> block, and the whole point
of a <code>finally</code> block is that there is no way you can
escape without executing it.
</p>
<p>
So why didn’t <code>document.DestroyPlugins()</code> execute?
</p>
<p>
Because your exception handler itself encountered an exception.
</p>
<p>
The exception handler is not active during its own
<code>finally</code> clause.
As a result,
if an exception is thrown during <code>document.Close()</code>,
the exception handler search begins at the block
<strong>outside</strong> the <code>finally</code> block.
</p>
<p>
(That the exception handler is not active during its own
<code>finally</code> clause should be obvious.  It would mean
that if an exception were to occur during the <code>finally</code>
clause, the program would go into an infinite loop.  And it also
wouldn’t be possible to rethrow a caught exception; your <code>throw</code>
would end up caught by yourself!)
</p>
<p>
In this case, the exception was caught by some outer caller,
causing the remainder of the first <code>finally</code>
block to be abandoned.  The other <code>finally</code> blocks
do run since they contain the one that died.
</p>
