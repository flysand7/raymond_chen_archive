<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is this race condition that the OpenMutex documentation is trying to warn me about?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer asked for clarification on what they considered an enigmatic sentence in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684315(v=vs.85).aspx">the documentation for the <code>Open­Mutex</code> function</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If your multithreaded application must repeatedly create, open, and close a named mutex object, a race condition can occur. In this situation, it is better to use <b>Create­Mutex</b> instead of <b>Open­Mutex</b>, because <b>Create­Mutex</b> opens a mutex if it exists and creates it if it does not. </p></blockquote>
<p>“What is this race condition the documentation is talking about? Our program uses <code>Open­Mutex</code> and we are wondering if we should switch to <code>Create­Mutex</code>.” </p>
<p>Consider two threads. One thread calls <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, then <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, then <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, and so on. </p>
<p>The other thread calls <code>Open­Mutex</code>. </p>
<p>The race condition is that the second thread’s call to <code>Open­Mutex</code> will fail if it takes place after the first thread calls <code>Close­Handle</code> and before it gets to make its next call to <code>Create­Mutex</code>. </p>
<p>One of my colleagues couldn’t understand why MSDN bothers to say anything about this situation at all. “You can’t open a mutex that doesn’t exist. Duh. I think this adds more confusion than it helps.” </p>
<p>I suspect the reason why MSDN bothers to say anything about this is that there was a customer who had two threads. One thread calls <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, then <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, then <code>Create­Mutex</code>, then <code>Close­Handle</code>, and so on. The other thread calls <code>Open­Mutex</code>. </p>
<p>This customer found that if the second thread calls <code>Open­Mutex</code> at an inopportune time, the call fails. They then insisted that something be added to the documentation to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/jj643252.aspx">state explicitly that a bad idea is a bad idea</a>. Probably because they needed something in writing to show their management in order to justify the time they are going to need to spend fixing the bug. </p>
<p>Once again, MSDN has been forced into <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160519-00/?p=93495">being a pawn in some company’s internal politics</a>. </p>
