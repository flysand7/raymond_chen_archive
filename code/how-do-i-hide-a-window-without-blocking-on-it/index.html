<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I hide a window without blocking on it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was working on improving their application startup performance. They found that if their application was launched immediately after a fresh boot, the act of dismissing their splash screen was taking over 5% of their boot time. Their code removed the splash screen by calling <code>Show­Window(hwndSplash, SW_HIDE)</code>. They suspect that the splash screen thread has, for some reason, stopped responding to messages, and while an investigation into that avenue was undertaken, a parallel investigation into reducing the cost of hiding the splash screen was also begun.
 One of the things they tried was to remove the <code>WS_EX_TOOL­WINDOW</code> style and call <code>ITaskbarList::DeleteTab(hwndSplash)</code> but they found that it wasn’t helping.
 The reason it wasn’t helping is that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/21/10131989.aspx"> editing the window style generates <code>WM_STYLE­CHANGING</code>/<code>WM_STYLE­CHANGED</code> messages to the target window</a>, and now you’re back where you started.</p>
<p> A better way is to use <code>Show­Window­Async(hwndSplash, SW_HIDE)</code>. The <code>-Async</code> version of the <code>Show­Window</code> function is the <code>Send­Notify­Message</code> version of <code>Show­Window</code>: If the window belongs to another thread group, then it schedules the operation but does not wait for it to complete. </p>
