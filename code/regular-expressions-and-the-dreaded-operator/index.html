<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Regular expressions and the dreaded *? operator</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The regular expression *? operator means “Match as few characters  as necessary to make this pattern succeed.”  But look at what  happens when you mix it up a bit:
  <code>".*?"</code>
  This pattern matches a quoted string containing no embedded quotes.  This works because the first quotation mark starts the string,  the .*? gobbles up everything in between, and then the second   quotation mark eats the close-quote.
  (Note how this differs from <code>".*"</code>, which uses a greedy  match.  This time, the .* operator is perfectly happy to gobble  up quotation marks, as long as it leaves one to match the second  quotation mark in the pattern.)
  Okay, great, now let’s make a small change to the above pattern:
  <code>".*?"&gt;</code>
  All I did was stick a &gt; at the end of the pattern.  This would  therefore match a quoted string (containing no quotation marks)  followed by a &gt; character, right?
  Wrong.
  There’s nothing in .*? that says “no quotation marks allowed”.  It just says “Don’t match more than you need to.”  But there are  strings where it needs to match a quotation mark.  Consider:</p>
<table>
<col align="center" style="font-family: monospace;border: solid .5pt black"/>
<tr>
<td><code>"</code></td>
<td><code>hello"world</code></td>
<td><code>"</code></td>
<td><code>&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" style="border: solid .5pt black"><code>"</code></td>
<td align="center" style="border: solid .5pt black"><code>.*?</code></td>
<td align="center" style="border: solid .5pt black"><code>"</code></td>
<td align="center" style="border: solid .5pt black"><code>&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>  Notice that here, the .*? pattern matched the inner quotation mark  because that was the only way to make the pattern match successfully.  (“I wouldn’t have done it, but you forced me!”)
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/02/26/80465.aspx">Even smart people  make this mistake</a>.
  If you really don’t want quotation marks to match the .*? then you  need to say so.
<code>"[^"]*"&gt;</code>
  This means “Match a quotation mark, then zero or more characters that  aren’t quotation marks, then another quotation mark, and then a greater-than.”</p>
