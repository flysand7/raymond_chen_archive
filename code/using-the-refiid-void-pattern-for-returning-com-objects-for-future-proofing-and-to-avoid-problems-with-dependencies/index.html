<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Using the REFIID/void** pattern for returning COM objects for future-proofing and to avoid problems with dependencies</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Suppose you have a function that creates a reference to a COM object:
</p>
<pre>
// pixie.h
STDAPI CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(
    const PIXIEDUST *ppd,
    IShellItem **ppsi);
</pre>
<p>
There are a few issues with this design.
</p>
<p>
First of all, it requires that whoever uses your header file
must have included <code>shlobj.h</code> first,
since that’s where <code>IShell­Item</code> is defined.
You could solve that problem by putting
<code>#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;</code> at the top of
<code>pixie.h</code>,
but that creates its own problems.
For example, many header files alter their behavior based
on symbols that have been <code>#define</code>d,
and including that other header file as part of
<code>pixie.h</code> means that it’s going to use the settings
that were active at the time <code>pixie.h</code> was included
(which may not be what the clients of your header file are expecting).
For example:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
#include &lt;pixie.h&gt;
#define <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/24/10387757.aspx">STRICT_TYPED_ITEMIDS</a>
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This program wants to use strict typed item IDs,
so it defines the magic symbol before including
<code>shlobj.h</code>.
Unfortunately, that request is ignored because
the <code>pixie.h</code> header file secretly included
<code>shlobj.h</code> prematurely.
</p>
<p>
This can get particularly messy if somebody wants to
include <code>shlobj.h</code> with particular preprocessor
tricks temporarily active.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
#include &lt;pixie.h&gt;
// The WINDOWDATA structure added in Windows Vista conflicts
// with the one we defined back in 2000, so rename it to
// WINDOWDATA_WINDOWS.
#define WINDOWDATA WINDOWDATA_WINDOWS
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#undef WINDOWDATA
// Here's our version of WINDOWDATA
#include &lt;contosotypes.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This code works around a naming conflict that was created
when Windows Vista added a structure called
<code>WINDOW­DATA</code> to <code>shlobj.h</code>.
The application already had a structure with the same name,
so it has to rename the one in <code>shlobj.h</code> to
some other name to avoid a redefinition error.
</p>
<p>
If you made <code>pixie.h</code> include
<code>shlobj.h</code> on its own,
it would do so without this fancy renaming, and the
developers of that code will curse and say something like this:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;ole2.h&gt;
// The WINDOWDATA structure added in Windows Vista conflicts
// with the one we defined back in 2000, so rename it to
// WINDOWDATA_WINDOWS.
#define WINDOWDATA WINDOWDATA_WINDOWS
<font color="blue">// pixie.h secretly includes shlobj.h so we have to put its #include
// under WINDOWDATA protection.
#include &lt;pixie.h&gt;</font>
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#undef WINDOWDATA
// Here's our version of WINDOWDATA
#include &lt;contosotypes.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Another problem with the
<code>Create­Shell­Item­From­Pixie­Dust</code>
function is that it hard-codes the output interface to
<code>IShell­Item</code>.
When everybody moves on to
<code>IShell­Item2</code>,
all the callers will have to
follow the
<code>Create­Shell­Item­From­Pixie­Dust</code>
call with a <code>Query­Interface</code> to get the interface
they really want.
(Which, if your object is out-of-process,
could mean another round trip to the server.)
</p>
<p>
The solution to both of these problems is to simply make the
caller specify what type of object they want.
</p>
<pre>
// pixie.h
STDAPI CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(
    const PIXIEDUST *ppd,
    REFIID riid,
    void **ppv);
</pre>
<p>
Now that we are no longer mentioning
<code>IShell­Item</code> explicitly,
we don’t need to include <code>shlobj.h</code> any more.
And if the caller wants <code>IShell­Item2</code>,
they can just ask for it.
</p>
<p>
Your creation function used to look like this:
</p>
<pre>
STDAPI CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(
    const PIXIEDUST *ppd,
    IShellItem **ppsi)
{
    *ppsi = nullptr;
    IShellItem *psiResult;
    HRESULT hr = ... do whatever ...;
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
       *ppsi = psiResult;
    }
    return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
You simply have to tweak the way you return the pointer:
</p>
<pre>
STDAPI CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(
    const PIXIEDUST *ppd,
    <font color="blue">REFIID riid,
    void **ppv</font>)
{
    *ppv = nullptr;
    IShellItem *psiResult;
    HRESULT hr = ... do whatever ...;
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
       <font color="blue">hr = psiResult-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
       psiResult-&gt;Release();</font>
    }
    return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
Callers of your function would go from
</p>
<pre>
IShellItem *psi;
hr = CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(ppd, &amp;psi);
</pre>
<p>
to
</p>
<pre>
IShellItem *psi;
hr = CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(ppd, <font color="blue">IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psi)</font>);
</pre>
<p>
If the caller decides that they really want an
<code>IShell­Item2</code>,
they merely have to change their variable declaration;
the call to the creation function is unchanged.
</p>
<pre>
<font color="blue">IShellItem2 *psi;</font>
hr = CreateShellItemFromPixieDust(ppd, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psi));
</pre>
