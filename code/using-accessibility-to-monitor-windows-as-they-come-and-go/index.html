<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Using accessibility to monitor windows as they come and go</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today’s Little Program monitors windows as they come and go.
When people contemplate doing this,
they come up with ideas like installing a
<code>WH_CBT</code> hook
or a
<code>WH_SHELL</code> hook,
but one of the major problems with those types of hooks
is that they are injected hooks.
Injection is bad for a number of reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It forces the hook to be in a DLL so it can be injected.
<li>Hook activities need to be marshaled back to the main program.
<li>Your DLL will capture events only in processes of the same bitness,
    because
    <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/10/20/9006720.aspx">
    you cannot load a 32-bit DLL into a 64-bit process or vice versa</a>.
<li>You can inject into an elevated process only if your process
    is also elevated.
    If your process is non-elevated, then you will not capture
    events for windows belonging to elevated processes.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
This is where accessibility comes in handy,
because accessibility lets you specify whether you want your
hook to be an injected or non-injected one.
And if you’re non-injected, then the programming model is much simpler
because everything happens in your process
(indeed, on a single thread).

Take
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
the scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;strsafe.h&gt;
<p>BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 <font color="blue">g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(TEXT(“listbox”), NULL,
     LBS_HASSTRINGS | WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_VSCROLL,
     0, 0, 0, 0, hwnd, NULL, g_hinst, 0);
 if (!g_hwndChild) return FALSE;</font>
 return TRUE;
}</p>
<p><font color="blue">void CALLBACK WinEventProc(
    HWINEVENTHOOK hWinEventHook,
    DWORD event,
    HWND hwnd,
    LONG idObject,
    LONG idChild,

    DWORD dwmsEventTime
)
{
 if (hwnd &amp;&amp;
     idObject == OBJID_WINDOW &amp;&amp;
     idChild == CHILDID_SELF)
 {
  PCTSTR pszAction = NULL;
  TCHAR szBuf[80];
  switch (event) {
  case EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE:
   pszAction = TEXT(“created”);
   break;
  case EVENT_OBJECT_DESTROY:
   pszAction = TEXT(“destroyed”);
   break;
  }
  if (pszAction) {
   TCHAR szClass[80];
   TCHAR szName[80];
   szClass[0] = TEXT(‘\0’);
   szName[0] = TEXT(‘\0’);
   if (IsWindow(hwnd)) {
    GetClassName(hwnd, szClass, ARRAYSIZE(szClass));
    GetWindowText(hwnd, szName, ARRAYSIZE(szName));

   TCHAR szBuf[80];
   StringCchPrintf(szBuf, ARRAYSIZE(szBuf),
                   TEXT(“%p %s \”%s\” (%s)”), hwnd, pszAction,
                   szName, szClass);
   ListBox_AddString(g_hwndChild, szBuf);
  }
 }
}</font></p>
<p>int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
                   LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd)
{
 …
  ShowWindow(hwnd, nShowCmd);</p>
<p> <font color="blue">HWINEVENTHOOK hWinEventHook = SetWinEventHook(

   DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
  }</p>
<p>  <font color="blue">if (hWinEventHook) UnhookWinEvent(hWinEventHook);</font>
…
}
</p></pre>
<p>
This is a generalization of our earlier program which
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/26/10230020.aspx">
waits for a specific window to be destroyed</a>,
except that we now are watching <i>all</i> windows
for creation and destruction.
</p>
<p>
When you run this program, you see that there is a lot of
window activity,
but maybe you are interested only in windows when they are shown
and hidden.
No problem, that’s a small change:
</p>
<pre>
  switch (event) {
  <font color="blue">case EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW:
   pszAction = TEXT(“shown”);
   break;
  case EVENT_OBJECT_HIDE:
   pszAction = TEXT(“hidden”);
   break;</font>
  }
…
<p> HWINEVENTHOOK hWinEventHook = SetWinEventHook(
     <font color="blue">EVENT_OBJECT_SHOW, EVENT_OBJECT_HIDE</font>,
     NULL, WinEventProc, 0, 0,
     WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT | WINEVENT_SKIPOWNPROCESS);
</p></pre>
<p>
Notice that these notifications are received for windows
from both 32-bit and 64-bit processes,
and that they are received even for windows belonging
to elevated processes.
You can’t do that with an injected hook.
