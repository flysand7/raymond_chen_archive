<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I get the current directory for a non-current drive?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As we learned some time ago, each drive has its own current directory <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20101011-00/?p=12563">for backward-compatibility with DOS 1.0</a> (which predates the concept of directories). This is simulated internally by <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100506-00/?p=14133">magic environment variables</a>. But those magic environment variables are internal and are therefore not contractual. </p>
<p>What is the supported way of finding out the current directory for a non-current drive? </p>
<p>One approach I’ve seen is to perform this sequence of operations: </p>
<pre>
GetCurrentDirectory(ARRAYSIZE(originalDirectory), originalDirectory);
SetCurrentDirectory(TEXT("X:"));
GetCurrentDirectory(ARRAYSIZE(currentDirectoryOnX), currentDirectoryOnX);
SetCurrentDirectory(originalDirectory);
</pre>
<p>One problem with this approach is that it may not be able to return to the original directory if the original directory was deleted or is otherwise not settable. </p>
<p>Another problem with this approach is that it applies a global solution to a local problem: The current directory is a process-wide resource, so if there is another thread that is performing an operation that depends on the current directory, you just messed up that thread. </p>
<p>The supported way to get the current directory for a non-current drive is to call <code>Get­Full­Path­Name</code> and pass just the drive letter and a colon. This will resolve the drive letter to the current directory for that drive. </p>
<pre>
TCHAR buf[BUFFERSIZE];
TCHAR *file;
GetFullPathName(TEXT("X:"), BUFFERSIZE, buf, &amp;file);
</pre>
<p>Assuming the call succeeds, the result in the buffer is the current directory for drive <code>X:</code>. </p>
