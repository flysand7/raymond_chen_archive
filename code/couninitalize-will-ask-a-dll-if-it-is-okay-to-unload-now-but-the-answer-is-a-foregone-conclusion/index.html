<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">CoUninitalize will ask a DLL if it is okay to unload now, but the answer is a foregone conclusion</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The
<code>Dll­Can­Unload­Now</code> entry point
is exported by COM in-proc servers.
COM host applications call
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code> periodically
to ask COM to do DLL housecleaning,
and in response, COM asks each DLL if it is okay to be unloaded.
If so, then COM unloads the DLL.
</p>
<p>
What is not well-known is that COM also does DLL housecleaning
when you shut down the last apartment by calling
<code>Co­Uninitialize</code>.
When that happens, COM will still go around asking each DLL
whether it’s okay to be unloaded,
but the question is merely a formality, because
<i>regardless of your answer, COM will unload you anyway</i>.
</p>
<p>
The story here is that COM is being shut down for the process,
so COM knows that when the last
<code>Co­Uninitialize</code> is finished,
all COM objects will be destroyed.
After all, if you don’t have COM, then you can’t have any COM objects.
</p>
<p>
As a courtesy, COM will ask you,
“Is it okay to unload you?”
in case you want to do some early cleanup.
But it will ignore your answer.
</p>
<p>
This means that you need to exercise caution if you call
<code>Co­Uninitialize</code> or
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code> from
your COM in-proc server,
because the call may end up freeing your code out from under you.
</p>
<p>
For example, one third-party crash I investigated boiled down to a
COM object whose destructor went like this:
</p>
<pre>
MyComObject::~MyComObject()
{
 .. blah blah blah ..
 // Let DllCanUnloadNow know that we have one
 // fewer active COM object
 _Module.Unlock();
 CoFreeUnusedLibraries();
}
</pre>
<p>
It so happened that this was the last COM object created
by the DLL,
so the <code>_Module.Unlock()</code> call dropped
the DLL object count to zero.
The COM server then inexplicably called
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code> (something
that is supposed to be called by the host, not a plug-in),
and
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code> did
what it was told and asked each DLL,
“Hey,
do you mind if I unload you now?”
The DLL’s
<code>Dll­Can­Unload­Now</code> function
saw that the active COM object count was zero,
so it said,
“Sure, go ahead.”
</p>
<p>
I hope you see where this is going.
</p>
<p>
COM unloads your DLL because you said you were okay
with it.
The call to
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code> eventually
returns,
but its return address is inside the <code>My­Com­Object</code>
destructor, which was unloaded because
<i>you said it was okay to unload</i>.
</p>
<p>
The fix here is to remove the call to
<code>Co­Free­Unused­Libraries</code>.
It shouldn’t have been there in the first place.
</p>
<p>
A more common error is creating a background thread
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/05/10463645.aspx">
without bumping the DLL reference count</a>.
When the last COM apartment shuts down, COM will free
your DLL,
thereby stranding your worker thread.
You need to use the
<code>Free­Library­And­Exit­Thread</code>
trick to keep your DLL loaded until the background thread finishes.</p>
