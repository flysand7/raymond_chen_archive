<p>
        The mouse wheel is tricky because the mouse wheel UI guidelines indicate that you
        should scroll by a user-specified amount for each “click” of the mouse, where one
        click is <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code> mouse units (called a “detent”). There are two subtle
        points about the above requirement: First, that the amount of scrolling is a user
        setting which must be respected, and second, that the wheel can report values that
        are not perfect multiples of <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code>.
    </p>
<p>
        In particular, there is the possibility that a high-resolution mouse wheel will report
        wheel scroll units smaller than <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code>. For example, consider a
        wheel mouse that supports “half-clicks”. When you turn the wheel halfway between clicks,
        it reports <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code>/2, and when you reach a full click, it reports
        another <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code>/2. To handle this properly, you need to make sure
        that by the time the full click is reached, the window has scrolled by exactly the
        amount it would have scrolled if the user had been using a low-resolution wheel that
        reported a single wheel motion of <code>WHEEL_DELTA</code>.
    </p>
<p>
        (I once referred to this in email as a “sub-detent wheel” and was accused of coining
        a phrase.)
    </p>
<p>
        To handle the first point, we requery the user’s desired scroll delta at each mouse
        wheel message. To handle the second point, we accumulate detents as they arrive and
        consume as many of them as possible, leaving the extras for the next wheel message.

        Exercise: What is the significance of the <code>(int)</code> cast in the computation
        of <code>dLines</code>?

<p>
        Exercise: Assuming you don’t have a high-resolution wheel mouse, how would you test
        that your sub-detent mouse wheel handling was working properly?
