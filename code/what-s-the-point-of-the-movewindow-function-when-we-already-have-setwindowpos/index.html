<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s the point of the MoveWindow function when we already have SetWindowPos?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Phil Quirk notes via the suggestion box, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#544564"><code>MoveWindow</code> is just a weird function. I guess it’s easier to call than <code>SetWindowPos</code>, but that’s the only thing it seems to have going for it</a>.”</p>
<p> Yup, that’s about right. </p>
<p> The <code>MoveWindow</code> function doesn’t really do anything you couldn’t already do yourself with <code>SetWindowPos</code>. It’s just a convenience function. And it you look at it pretty closely, it’s really not that big of a convenience either, saving you one parameter (<code>hwndInsertAfter</code>) and replacing the flag <code>SWP_NOREDRAW</code> with a boolean parameter. </p>
<p> Whoop-dee-doo. </p>
<p> It shouldn’t take too much imagination to figure out how this situation came about. It’s the same reason why you have both <code>CreateWindow</code> and <code>CreateWindowEx</code>. </p>
