<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I accept files to be opened via IDropTarget instead of on the command line? – bonus content</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues tipped me off to some additional resources on the subject of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006065.aspx"> using the DropTarget technique for accepting files for execution</a>.
 First, it turns out that there is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940354(VS.85).aspx"> an SDK sample that demonstrates the DropTarget technique</a> after all. This sample is fifteen years late <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006065.aspx#10006804"> according to one commenter</a> who apparently thinks that the Platform SDK needs to provide a sample for a feature that won’t be invented for another twelve years. Maybe we can use <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/05/video-microsoft-attempts-to-predict-the-future/"> the Microsoft Research project to predict the future</a>. No wait, we also need to get them to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/03/567318.aspx"> invent the time machine</a> so we can take the future-predictor machine back in time 15 years.
 Second, there is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940356(VS.85).aspx"> a sample for the ExecuteCommand technique</a>. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/12/9977246.aspx"> ExecuteCommand technique</a> is preferred over the DropTarget technique because it is much easier to implement. (Translation: much less you can get wrong.) Like the DropTarget technique, the ExecuteCommand supports out-of-process activation.</p>
<p> And third, as it turns out, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872121(VS.85).aspx#appPaths"> App Path registration supports <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> after all</a>, thereby addressing  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006065.aspx#10006529"> one of the complaints raised by a commenter</a> (a complaint I answered incorrectly). </p>
