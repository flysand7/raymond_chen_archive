<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the difference between LastWriteTime and ChangeTime in FILE_BASIC_INFO?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>FILE_BASIC_INFO</code> structure contains a number of fields which record the last time a particular action occurred. Two of the fields seem to describe the same thing.</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<dl>
<dt>Last­Write­Time  </dt>
<dl>
<dd>The time the file was last written to.
<dl>
<dt>Change­Time  </dt>
<dl>
<dd>
<p>The time the file was changed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dl>
</dd>

<p> What’s the difference between writing to a file and changing it?
 I’m told that the difference is metadata. The Last­Write­Time covers writes to the file’s data stream (which you accomplish via the <code>Write­File</code> function). On the other hand, the Change­Time also includes changes to the file metadata, such as changing its file attributes (hidden, read-only, <i>etc</i>.) or renaming the file.</p>
<p> (And don’t forget that <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/filecab/archive/2006/11/07/disabling-last-access-time-in-windows-vista-to-improve-ntfs-performance.aspx"> Last­Access­Time updates are off by default now</a>.) </p>
