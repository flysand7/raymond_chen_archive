<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Explain why we used 0x7FFF to represent infinite height.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Commenter “Reiko” got this right. 0x7FFF is the maximum integer coordinate supported by Windows 95, 98 and Me.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Explain the line <code>rcWindow.bottom += rcTemp.top</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The more precise way of writing the line would have been</p>
<pre>    rcWindow.bottom += (rcTemp.top - rcWindow.top) - (0 - rcWindow.top);
</pre>
<p>The first term is the amount of non-client space consumed at the top of the window. The second term is the amount of non-client space consumed at the top of the window, taking wrapping into account. The difference, therefore is the amount by which <i>AdjustWindowRectEx</i> needs to be adjusted. But the two instances of <code>rcWindow.top</code> cancel out, leaving just <code>rcTemp.top</code>.</p>
