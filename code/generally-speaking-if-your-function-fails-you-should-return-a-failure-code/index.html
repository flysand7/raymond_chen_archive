A customer
requested assistance with their shell namespace extension,
and the request worked its way to me for resolution.

<p>
The customer was at a loss because the customer’s code was
nowhere on the stack.
What is wrong?
</p>
<p>
The customer didn’t provide a dump file or any other information
beyond the stack trace.
(Hint: When reporting a problem with a shell namespace extension,
at least mention the last few method calls your namespace extension
received before the crash.)
I was forced to use my psychic powers to solve the problem.
But you can, too.
All the information you need is right there in front of you.
</p>
<p>
The shell faulted on a null pointer in the function
<code>CShellItem::_GetPropertyStoreWorker</code>,
which from its name is clearly a worker function which
obtains the property store from a shell item.
</p>
<p>
At this point, you put on your thinking cap.
Why is the shell taking a null pointer fault trying to retrieve
the property store from a shell item?
Remember that the problem is tied to a custom namespace extension.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
My psychic powers tell me that the namespace extension
returned <code>S_OK</code>
from <code>GetUIObjectOf(IPropertyStoreFactory)</code>
but set the output pointer to <code>NULL</code>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(It turns out my psychic powers were weak without coffee, because
the initial psychic diagnosis was <code>GetUIObjecttOf(IPropertyStore)</code>
instead of <code>IPropertyStoreFactory</code>.)
</p>
<p>
As a general rule, if your function fails, then you should
return a failure code, not a success code.
There are exceptions to this rule, particular when OLE automation
is involved, but it’s a good rule to start with.
</p>
<p>
The customer reported that fixing their
<code>IShellFolder::BindToObject</code> to return an error code
when it failed fixed the problem.
The customer then followed up with another crash, again providing
startling little information.

The customer reported that
<code>IQueryInfo::SetInfoTip</code> is getting called.
The customer liaison added,
“Raymond, I’m looking forward to your psychic powers again.”
</p>
<p>
Apparently, some people don’t understand that psychic powers are not
something you ask for.
It’s my way of scolding you for not providing enough information
to make a quality diagnosis possible.
You don’t come back saying,
“Hey, thanks for answering my question even though I did a crappy job
of asking it.
Here’s another crappy question!”
</p>
<p>
I reported back that my psychic powers were growing weary from overuse,
and that the customer might want to expend a little more time investigating
the problem themselves.
Especially since it has the same root cause as their previous problem.
