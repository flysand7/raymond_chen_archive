<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Drawing an active-looking caption even when not active</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
        “Why would somebody ever want to do that?” you might ask. Well, this is a common appearance
        for floating toolbars. (But aside from that case, I can’t think of any other valid
        reason to draw a window as active even though it isn’t.)

        Fortunately this is easy to do. Just add this line to the <code>WndProc</code> of
        our scratch program:
    </p>
<pre>    case WM_NCACTIVATE: if (wParam == FALSE) wParam = TRUE; break;
</pre>
<p>
        This says, “If Windows asks me to paint my caption bar in the inactive state, turn
        around and draw it in the active state.”
