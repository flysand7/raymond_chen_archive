<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I get WRL to link my object into its activation factory?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Recall that under <a href="/other/the-classical-model-for-linking"> the classical model for linking</a>, symbols in libraries are not included unless they or some other symbol in the same object file is referenced by an explicitly-included object file, or indirectly via a chain of object files.</p>
<p>Component libraries like ATL and WRL use a linker trick to create self-registering objects. ATL has a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/reference/object-map-macros?view=msvc-160"> object map macros</a> for doing this, and WRL has its own macros for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cppcx/wrl/activatableclass-macros?view=msvc-160"> activatable objects</a> and COM-creatable objects.</p>
<p>But if your object is in a static library, you need to do something to pull in those object files.</p>
<p>For ATL, Larry Osterman used the trick of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/larryosterman/when-i-moved-my-code-into-a-library-what-happened-to-my-atl-com-objects"> calling two dummy functions in the object file from dead code</a>.</p>
<p>WRL codifies the mechanism with a set of macros that create explicit references to the magic objects:</p>
<pre>#define WrlCreatorMapIncludePragma(className)
#define WrlCreatorMapIncludePragmaex(className, serverName)
#define CoCreatableClassWrlCreatorMapInclude(className)
#define CoCreatableClassWrlCreatorMapIncludeEx(className, serverName)
</pre>
<p>Invoke those macros somewhere in the main project (next to your <code>DllMain</code> is a fairly obvious place), and they will pull in the object registration information.</p>
