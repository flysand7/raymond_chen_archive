<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Debugging a GDI resource leak: Case study</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was asked to help debug a problem. A program was leaking GDI bitmaps like crazy, and after a while, the GDI resource handle count reached 9,999, at which point GDI said, “That’s it, I’m cutting you off.” </p>
<p>The problem isn’t discovered until after the limit has been reached. </p>
<p>To debug this, I’m gong to use different <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050815-11/?p=34583">poor man’s way of identifying memory leaks</a>. We begin the story with a GDI handle that has been identified as leaked: <code>0x13054e2f</code>. My first step is to get some basic information about this GDI object by simulating a call to <code>Get­Object</code>. </p>

<p>First, I allocated some memory that I can use to hold the <code>BITMAP</code> structure. </p>

<p>Next, I <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151016-00/?p=91341">simulate a call to the <code>Get­ObjectW</code> function</a>¹ by setting up the inbound parameter registers: <code>rcx</code> is the GDI object we are geting information about, <code>rdx</code> is the size of the output buffer, <code>r8</code> is the output buffer itself (which we just allocated). </p>
<p>I’m pulling a super-sneaky trick here. Normally, we reserve shadow space for the outbound call, and then simulate the <code>call</code> instruction by pushing the return address on the stack. But we didn't do any of that here. We just moved <code>rip</code> directly to the function we wanted to call. But I can skip those steps because I stepped to the <code>ret</code> instruction. This means that the stack is already set up the way it would be immediately upon entry to the function. We are reusing the stack frame of the <code>Dbg­Break­Point</code> function! We are reusing the shadow space provided by the caller, and we are taking advantage of the proper stack alignment established by the caller. </p>

<p>I run the <code>Get­ObjectW</code> function with the <code>gu</code> command, which means "go until the current function returns". When it returns, I verify that the call succeeded (by checking the return value in <code>rax</code>), and the dump the <code>BITMAP</code> structure. </p>
<p>This tells me that I have a 16×16 monochrome bitmap. Monochrome bitmaps are rarely-used in Windows nowadays. One place you'll see them is in icons, since an icon consists of two bitmaps: A monochrome mask and a color image. </p>
<p>So let's assume that we're leaking the mask of an icon. These things come out of two functions: <code>Get­Icon­Info</code> and <code>Get­Icon­Info­Ex</code>, so I set breakpoints on both. (Actually three functions since <code>Get­Icon­Info­Ex</code> has both Unicode and ANSI variations.) </p>

<p>The breakpoint hits pretty quickly. </p>

</pre>
<p>Going back to the source code for <code>Is­Icon­Correct­Size</code> confirms that this function calls <code>Get­Icon­Info</code> (presumably to get the size of the icon) and forgets to delete the two bitmaps. </p>
<p>Root cause identified. The fix is to delete those bitmaps. </p>
<p>Forgetting to delete the bitmaps that come out of the <code>Get­Icon­Info</code> family of functions is a common mistake. </p>
<p>¹ The <code>ntsd</code> debugger doesn't have a C compiler built-in, so we have to build these things manually. </p>
