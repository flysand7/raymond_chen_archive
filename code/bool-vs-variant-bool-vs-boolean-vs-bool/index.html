<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">BOOL vs. VARIANT_BOOL vs. BOOLEAN vs. bool</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Still more ways of saying the same thing.
Why so many?
</p>
<p>
Because each was invented by different people
at different times to solve different problems.
</p>
<p>
<code>BOOL</code> is the oldest one.  Its definition is simply
</p>
<pre>
typedef int BOOL;
</pre>
<p>
The C programming language uses “int” as its boolean type,
and Windows 1.0 was written back when C was the cool
language for systems programming.
</p>
<p>
Next came <code>BOOLEAN</code>.
</p>
<pre>
typedef BYTE  BOOLEAN;
</pre>
<p>
This type was introduced by the
OS/2 NT team when they decided to write a new
operating system from scratch.  It lingers in Win32
in the places where the original NT design peeks through,
like the security subsystem and interacting with drivers.
</p>
<p>
Off to the side came <code>VARIANT_BOOL</code>.
</p>
<pre>
typedef short VARIANT_BOOL;
#define VARIANT_TRUE ((VARIANT_BOOL)-1)
#define VARIANT_FALSE ((VARIANT_BOOL)0)
</pre>
<p>
This was developed by the Visual Basic folks.
Basic uses <code>-1</code> to represent “true”
and <code>0</code> to represent “false”,
and <code>VARIANT_BOOL</code> was designed to preserve this behavior.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Common bug</strong>:  When manipulating <code>VARIANT</code>s
of type <code>VT_BOOL</code>, and you want to set a boolean value to “true”,
you must use <code>VARIANT_TRUE</code>.
Many people mistakenly use <code>TRUE</code> or <code>true</code>,
which are not the same thing as <code>VARIANT_TRUE</code>.
You can cause problem with scripting languages if you get them confused.
(For symmetry, you should also use <code>VARIANT_FALSE</code>
instead of <code>FALSE</code> or <code>false</code>.
All three have the same numerical value, however.
Consequently, a mistake when manipulating “false” values is not fatal.)
</p>
<p>
Newest on the scene is <code>bool</code>, which is a C++ data type
that has the value <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
You won’t see this used much (if at all) in Win32 because Win32 tries to
remain C-compatible.
</p>
<p>
(Note that C-compatible isn’t the same as C-friendly.
Although you can do COM from C, it isn’t fun.)
