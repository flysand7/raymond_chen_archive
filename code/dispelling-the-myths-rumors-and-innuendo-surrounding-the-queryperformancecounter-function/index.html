<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dispelling the myths, rumors, and innuendo surrounding the QueryPerformanceCounter function</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The <code>Query­Performance­Counter</code> function has been the subject of much rumor and innuendo. In response to all the confusion, the kernel folks put together a page which <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn553408(v=vs.85).aspx"> tries to settle the controversy once and for all</a>. It discusses the history of QPC over the ages, the problems it had on earlier versions of Windows or older firmware (which is probably where a lot of the myths started), its interaction with hypervisors, offers guidance on how to use it and its alternatives, and includes a very nice Q&amp;A.</p>
