<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When is a window visible yet not visible?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today, a quick puzzler.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
 ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
 assert(IsWindowVisible(hwnd));
</pre>
<p>
We just showed the window, certainly it is visible, right?
Yet the assertion can fire (even in the absence of multi-threading).  Why?
</p>
<p>
Answer below – stop reading if you want to try to solve it yourself.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-iswindowvisible">
the <code>IsWindowVisible</code> function</a>.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
If the specified window, its parent window, its parent’s parent window,
and so forth, have the <code>WS_VISIBLE</code> style,
the return value is nonzero. Otherwise, the return value is zero.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The <code>WS_VISIBLE</code> style indicates that this window is
visible in its parent.  But the parent itself might not be visible,
in which case <code>IsWindowVisible</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>.
