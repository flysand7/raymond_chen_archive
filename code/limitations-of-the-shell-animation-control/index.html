<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Limitations of the shell animation control</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/animation/animationoverview.asp"> The Animation control in the shell common controls library</a> supports only a very limited class of AVI files.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AVI must be non-interleaved. </li>
<li>The AVI must have exactly one video stream. </li>
<li>The AVI may not have an audio stream. </li>
<li>The AVI may not use palette changes. </li>
<li>The AVI must be either uncompressed or BI_RLE8-compressed. </li>
</ul>
<p> Why all these restrictions?
 Because the purpose of the Animation control is to be able to show <strong>simple</strong> animations. If you have a complex animation, you should be using one of the more advanced animation controls, like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/multimed/htm/_win32_mciwnd_window_class.asp"> the MCIWnd window class</a>.
 There would be no benefit to adding all the advanced AVI playback features were added to the shell Animation control.  The result would just be a pointless clone of MCIWnd.</p>
<p> This is something you need to keep in mind when designing a component whose original design goal is to be a simpler version of some other component. You must resist the urge to add features from that other component to your component. If you succumb, then you will end up with a component that does everything the original component did, even though your goal was to be a simpler version.  So why did you write it? You spent months writing something that already exists. </p>
