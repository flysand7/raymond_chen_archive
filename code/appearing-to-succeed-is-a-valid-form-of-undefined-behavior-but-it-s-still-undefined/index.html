<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Appearing to succeed is a valid form of undefined behavior, but it's still undefined</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer requested a clarification on
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa366701.aspx">
the MSDN documentation
for the <code>HeapFree</code> function</a>.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
The MSDN documentation says that if the <code>lpMem</code>
parameter is <code>NULL</code>, then the behavior is undefined.
Is this true?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As explicitly stated in MSDN, the behavior is undefined.
Observe that
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383701.aspx">
the annotation</a>
on the <code>lpMem</code>
parameter is <code>__in</code>,
which means that the parameter must be a non-<code>NULL</code>
value provided by the caller.
(If <code>NULL</code> were permitted, the annotation would have
been <code>__in_opt</code>.)
</p>
<p>
Undefined behavior means that <i>anything can happen</i>.
The program might crash immediately.
It might crash five minutes later.
It might send email to your boss saying that you screwed up
and then read you Vogon poetry.
Or maybe not.
</p>
<p>
MSDN says don’t do it, so don’t do it.
</p>
<p>
The customer explained why they were interested in knowing
more information about undefined behavior:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We were interested because there is a mismatch between
the semantics of a function we are implementing
(where <code>NULL</code> is valid and ignored)
and the function <code>HeapFree</code> we are using
as the implementation.
It looks like Windows Vista returns <code>TRUE</code> if
you pass <code>NULL</code>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If there is a mismatch in semantics
between the function you are implementing
and the function you are calling,
it is your responsibility as the programmer to bridge
the gap.
The customer didn’t say what function they were implementing,
but I’m guessing it was something like
<code>operator delete</code>.
Since your function accepts <code>NULL</code> but
<code>HeapFree</code> doesn’t,
it is your responsibility to filter out <code>NULL</code> parameters.
</p>
<pre>
void operator delete(void* ptr) throw ()
{
 <font color="blue">if (ptr != NULL)</font>
  HeapFree(CustomHeap, 0, ptr);
}
</pre>
<p>
This concept goes by the fancy name of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">
the Adapter Pattern</a>.
The less fancy name is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function">
wrapper function</a>.
</p>
<p>
And the value returned by <code>HeapFree</code> on Windows Vista
is irrelevant.
Pretending to succeed is a valid form of undefined behavior,
because
<i>anything</i> qualifies as undefined behavior.
</p>
<p>
(Of course,
you can’t assume that returning <code>TRUE</code> will always be
the result of triggering undefined behavior.
After all, if you could rely on it, then it wouldn’t be undefined any
more!)</p>
