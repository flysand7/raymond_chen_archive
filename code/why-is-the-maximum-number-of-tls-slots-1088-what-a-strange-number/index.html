<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the maximum number of TLS slots 1088? What a strange number.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Max noted that the maximum number of TLS slots is 1088 and wondered <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160610-00/?p=93645#comment-1252095">why such a strange number</a>. “I mean, it does not look like a perfect number in terms of 2-based numeric system.” </p>
<p>It looks a little better in base 2. The value is <code>10001000000</code> which breaks down as 1024 + 64. </p>
<p>When TLS was first introduced, the number of available TLS slots was 64, and those slots were pre-allocated as part of the thread control block. Over time, 64 slots turn out not to be enough, so the kernel team modified the code to allocate a page of data per thread once the 65th request for a TLS slot was made. A page of data is 4KB, which has enough room for 1024 32-bit values. That’s why the total is 1088. It’s the original 64 slots, plus an addition 1024 slots. </p>
<p>Note that the statement that “the maximum number of slots is 1088” is a statement of current implementation, not a contractual obligation. The contractual obligation is that there will always be at least <code>TLS_</code><code>MINIMUM_</code><code>AVAILABLE</code> slots available. Any more than that is just gravy. </p>
