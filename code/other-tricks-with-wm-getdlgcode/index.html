<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Other tricks with WM_GETDLGCODE</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The WM_GETDLCODE message lets you influence the behavior of the dialog manager. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/14/55678.aspx"> A previous entry on using WM_GETDLGCODE</a> described the <code>DLGC_HASSETSEL</code> flag which controls whether edit control content is auto-selected when focus changes.
 I was going to write a bit about the other flags, but it turns out that <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q83/3/02.ASP"> Knowledge Base Article 83302</a> already covers this, so I’ll just call out some highlights.
 The <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> flag is the most powerful one. It lets your control prevent the dialog manager from handling a message.  So for example if you don’t want ESC to dismiss the dialog box when focus is on a particular control but rather be delivered to the control itself, handle the <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message and peek at the <code>lParam</code>. If it is a press of the ESC key, then return <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> so the message will not be handled by the dialog manager.
 The <code>DLGC_WANTCHARS</code>, <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code> and <code>DLGC_WANTARROWS</code> flags are just conveniences that save you the trouble of checking certain categories of messages.</p>
<p> As always, consider the consequences of overriding default behavior. Doing so generally makes your program harder to use, since it goes against what people are accustomed to seeing in other programs.  </p>
