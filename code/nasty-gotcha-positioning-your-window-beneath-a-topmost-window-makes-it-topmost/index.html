<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nasty gotcha: Positioning your window beneath a topmost window makes it topmost</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s a nasty gotcha with the <code>Defer­Window­Pos</code> function, and therefore any functions built on top of it, such as <code>Set­Window­Pos</code>: If you specify a <code>hwndInsertAfter</code>, and the insert-after window is topmost, then the window being positioned will be placed immediately after that window.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>The hidden gotcha is that the window will be placed in the same zone as the insert-after window, which is the topmost zone.</p>
<p>In other words, the window will be made topmost, even if it wasn’t topmost previously.</p>
<p>Which is probably not what you were expecting.</p>
