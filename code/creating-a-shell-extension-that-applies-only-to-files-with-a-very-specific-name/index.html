<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Creating a shell extension that applies only to files with a very specific name</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today’s Little Program isn’t even a program. It demonstrates how to register a shell context menu command that applies only to files with a specific name. </p>
<p>Let’s say that you want a special context menu command, let’s call it <i>Party!</i>, on any file called <code>party.txt</code>. If invoked, it runs CharMap because everybody knows that CharMap is a total party animal. </p>
<p>Now, if you wanted the command to apply to any text file, you would use the following registration: </p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\Party!\command]
@="charmap.exe"
</pre>
<p>But this offers the <i>Party!</i> command on humorless files like <code>readme.txt</code>. </p>
<p>Fixing this is a special case of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/07/10391707.aspx">getting dynamic behavior for static verbs by using Advanced Query Syntax</a>. In this case, we create an Advanced Query Syntax filter that selects an exact file name. </p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt\shell\Party!]
"AppliesTo"="System.FileName:=Party.txt"
</pre>
