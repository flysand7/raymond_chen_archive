<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happens to the value returned from the function passed to Queue­User­Work­Item?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Queue­User­Work­Item</code> function schedules a function to be called from a thread pool thread. It’s one of the so-called <i>legacy thread pool functions</i>, a group of functions introduced in Windows 2000 in the first version of the system thread pool. It has since been superseded by the new thread pool functions like <code>Create­Threadpool­Work</code>, but the old functions continue to work, for compatibility. (They are implemented as wrappers around the new thread pool functions.)</p>
<p>Curiously, the <code>Queue­User­Work­Item</code> function takes a <code>LPTHREAD_<wbr/>START_<wbr/>ROUTINE</code> function pointer as the function to run on a thread pool thread. This is curious because the <code>LPTHREAD_<wbr/>START_<wbr/>ROUTINE</code> function returns a <code>DWORD</code>. What does the system do with the <code>DWORD</code> returned by a work item?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The return value is simply discarded.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you return, as long as you return <i>something</i>. (And do make sure you return <i>something</i>. Don’t just fall off the end of the function and return uninitialized garbage, because <a href="/code/uninitialized-garbage-on-ia64-can-be-deadly"> that uninitialized garbage could be deadly</a>.)</p>
