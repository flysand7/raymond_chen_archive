<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I make it more difficult for somebody to take a screenshot of my window?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
Ultimately,
you can’t stop somebody from ignoring the words
<i>Confidential</i> at the top of a document and
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh241037.aspx">
whipping out a digital camera
and taking a picture of the screen</a>.
But at least
starting in Windows 7
you can make it a little more difficult.
</p>
<p>
Take our
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and add this one line:
</p>
<pre>
    …
    <font color="blue">SetWindowDisplayAffinity(hwnd, WDA_MONITOR);</font>
    ShowWindow(hwnd, nShowCmd);
    …
</pre>
<p>
Assuming you have the Desktop Window Manager enabled,
you will find that
attempting to capture our scratch program in a screenshot
or via the Snipping Tool
will result in black pixels.
</p>
<p>
Remember, this is just an obstacle, not a security measure.
If somebody is determined to get the pixels,
this step is only going to slow them down a little.
(For example,
on Windows 7, they can simply disable the Desktop Window Manager.)
But it’s handy for reducing the likelihood of an accidental
breach of confidential information.

<b>Pre-emptive hate</b>:
“DRM is evil!”
My response to you: If you don’t like DRM,
then don’t buy DRM-protected content.
If you don’t like IRM,
then don’t read IRM-protected documents.
If you don’t like Blu-Ray,
then don’t buy Blu-Ray DVDs.
