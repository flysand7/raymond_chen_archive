<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does SHGetKnownFolderPath fail when impersonating?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was having trouble with the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>We are calling the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function. from a service while impersonating a user, but it returns <code>E_ACCESS­DENIED</code>. It’s failing both for <code>FOLDERID_Program­Data</code> and <code>FOLDERID_Roaming­App­Data</code>: </p>
<pre>
hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(
        FOLDERID_ProgramData, // folder ID
        0,                    // flags
        nullptr,              // token
        &amp;path);           // result
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we could reply, the customer followed up: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>We found that if we save the token that is being used for impersonation and pass it to the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function. then it works. But we are not sure why is it working now since the call was already being made while impersonating, and the documentation for the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function says that if you want to get the known folder path for the current user, then you pass <code>NULL</code> as the token. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110928-00/?p=9533">the default answer to “Does this work while impersonating?” is No</a>. When the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function says “the current user”, it roughly means “the user under whose identity the process is running”, but more importantly, it means the user whose registry is mapped as <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>, which, as we saw earlier, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141121-00/?p=43563">is a very tricky proposition for a service that impersonates</a>. </p>
<p>In this case, what’s probably happening is that the service is running as something like SYSTEM, and <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> points to SYSTEM’s registry, and the impersonated user does not have access to SYSTEM’s registry, hence <code>E_ACCESS­DENIED</code>. </p>
<p>The backstory is that the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function (and its close relatives like <code>SHGet­Special­Folder­Path</code>) are overwhelmingly used by normal applications that do no impersonation, so that’s the use case they are optimized for. if you pass <code>NULL</code> as the token, then the functions will read from <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> and cache the results. If the thread is impersonating, but you fail to pass the impersonation token to the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function, then it might return the (wrong) cached value, or it might try to read the value from the (wrong) <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> hive. Whatever happens, it’s probably going to be wrong. To say, “No, don’t use any of your fancy optimizations for normal applications, because I’m not a normal application. Get the known folder path for this specific user by reading from that user’s registry.” </p>
<p>You might say, “Well, the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function should auto-detect whether it is being called when impersonating and compensate accordingly.” Maybe, but that means introducing an expensive test to a hot code path to cover a rare case. that people shouldn’t expect to work anyway because <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110928-00/?p=9533">the default answer to “Does this work while impersonating?” is No</a>. Instead, the extra work of dealing with impersonation is transferred to the people who want to get this information while impersonating. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Even if you pass the correct token to the <code>SHGet­Known­Folder­Path</code> function, you may still run afoul of other requirements. In particularly, note the sentence </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>In addition to passing the user’s <i>hToken</i>, the registry hive of that specific user must be mounted. </p></blockquote>
<p>If the registry hive is not mounted, then there is no way to look up the information in the registry because, well, it’s not in the registry. You can use the <code>Load­User­Profile</code> function to load the profile into the registry. Just remember to call <code>Unload­User­Profile</code> when you’re done. (See the documentation for details.) </p>
