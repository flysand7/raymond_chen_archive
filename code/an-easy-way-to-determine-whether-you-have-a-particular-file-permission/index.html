<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An easy way to determine whether you have a particular file permission</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sometimes you might want to determine whether you <strong>can</strong> do something without actually doing it. For example, you might want to know whether you have a particular permission in a directory, say permission to delete files from it. </p>
<p>One way is to retrieve the ACL and then check whether the current user has the desired permission. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/security/security/accesscheck.asp">AccessCheck function</a> does most of the heavy lifting there. </p>
<p>Or you can realize, “Hey, wait a second, there is an entire security infrastructure whose job it is to decide who can access which files. Why not use it?” </p>
<p>For example, here’s how you can check whether the user has permission to delete files from a directory: </p>
<pre>BOOL CanDeleteFilesFromDirectory(LPCTSTR pszPath)
{
  HANDLE h = CreateFile(pszPath, FILE_DELETE_CHILD, FILE_SHARE_READ |
                        FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE, NULL,
                        OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, NULL);
  if (h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    CloseHandle(h);
  }
  return h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
}
</pre>
<p>What we did was open the directory (which requires backup semantics) and ask for FILE_DELETE_CHILD access. If it succeeded, then we have permission to delete files from it. [Corrected 7:52am]</p>
<p>Note, of course, that this information is purely advisory. You shouldn’t be making security decisions based on this, because the permissions might change between the time you check and the time you try. </p>
