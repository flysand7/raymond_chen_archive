<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Taking a shortcut: You can query properties from a volume, and it will forward to the physical drive</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you have the handle to a volume, you can issue certain disk ioctls to the volume, and it will forward them to the underlying disk. We saw this earlier when we used <code>IOCTL_</code><code>STORAGE_</code><code>GET_</code><code>DEVICE_</code><code>NUMBER</code> to obtain the physical drive number from a volume. The name of the ioctl is <code>IOCTL_</code><code>STORAGE</code>, but we issued it against a volume anyway.</p>
<p>And as we saw earlier, if the volume does not have a unique physical disk, then the call will fail.</p>
<p>This feature is particularly handy with storage property queries. For example, you can ask what how the drive is connected to the system by querying the volume:</p>
<pre>wil::unique_hfile volume = GetVolumeHandleForFile(L"C:\\");

STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY query{};
query.PropertyId = StorageAdapterProperty;
query.QueryType = PropertyStandardQuery;
DWORD bytesWritten;
STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR result{};

if (DeviceIoControl(volume.get(), IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY,
    &amp;query, sizeof(query),
    &amp;result, sizeof(result),
    &amp;bytesWritten, nullptr)) {
    /* result.BusType tells you how the drive is connected */
}
</pre>
<p>Next time, we’ll use this to answer a commonly-asked question.</p>
