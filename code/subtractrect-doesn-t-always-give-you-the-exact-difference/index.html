<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">SubtractRect doesn't always give you the exact difference</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The <code>Subtract­Rect</code> function takes a source
rectangle and subtracts out the portion which intersects
a second rectangle,
returning the result in a third rectangle.
But wait a second,
the result of subtracting one rectangle from another need not
be another rectangle.
It might be an L-shape,
or it might be a rectangle with a rectangular hole.
How does this map back to a rectangle?
</p>
<p>
The documentation for
<code>Subtract­Rect</code> says
that the function performs the subtraction when they
“intersect completely in either the x- or y-direction.”
But I prefer to think of it as the alternate formulation
offered in the documentation:
“In other words, the resulting rectangle is the bounding box
of the geometric difference.”
</p>
<p>
I was reminded of this subject when I saw some code
that tried to do rectangle manipulation like this:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// Clip rcA to be completely inside rcB.
RECT rcSub;
// rcSub = the part of rcA that stick out beyond rcB
if (SubtractRect(&amp;rcSub, &amp;rcA, &amp;rcB)) {
    // Remove that part from rcA
    SubtractRect(&amp;rcA, &amp;rcA, &amp;rcSub);
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
If the rectangle <code>rcA</code> extends beyond <code>rcB</code>
in more than one direction,
then the geometric difference will not be rectangular,
and the result of
<code>Subtract­Rect</code>
will be expanded to the bounding box of the difference,
which means that it will return <code>rcA</code> again.
And then the second line will subtract it all out,
leaving the rectangle empty.
</p>
<p>
Oops.
</p>
<p>
What they really wanted was
</p>
<pre>
// Clip rcA to be completely inside rcB.
IntersectRect(&amp;rcA, &amp;rcA, &amp;rcB);
</pre>
