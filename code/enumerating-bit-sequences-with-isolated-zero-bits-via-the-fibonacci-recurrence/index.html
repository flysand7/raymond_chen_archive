<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Enumerating bit sequences with isolated zero-bits via the Fibonacci recurrence</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s Little Program enumerates bit sequences of a particular
length subject to the constraint that you cannot have consecutive 0-bits.
This may sound kind of arbitrary, but it is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_code_recording">
important in magnetic media storage</a>,
because you cannot go too long without a
flux reversal (traditionally represented by a 1);
otherwise,
the read head’s clock starts to drift and gets out of sync
with the data.
(The read head uses flux reversals both for signaling and for
clock synchronization.)
</p>
<p>
Let’s say that an <i>allowable</i> bit sequence is one that contains
no consecutive 0-bits.
</p>
<p>
The recurrence for enumerating these types of constrained bit
sequence is the Fibonacci recurrence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<var>F</var>(<var>n</var>) = <var>F</var>(<var>n</var> − 1) + <var>F</var>(<var>n</var> − 2)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The way to see this is to study the last digit in an allowable bit sequence.
</p>
<p>
If the last digit is a 1, then if you delete it, you have
an allowable bit sequence that is one digit shorter.
Conversely, you can take any allowable
bit sequence of length <var>n</var> − 1
and tack a 1 onto it, and you’ll have an allowable sequence.
</p>
<p>
If the last digit is a 0, then if you delete it, you also have
an allowable bit sequence that is one digit shorter,
but not all allowable bit sequences of length <var>n</var> − 1
can be reached in this way.
Allowable bit sequences that end in 0 cannot be reached
because adding another 0 would result in two consecutive 0-bits,
which is disallowed.
Therefore, the last digit of the truncated bit sequence must be 1,
and what you really have is an allowable bit sequence of length
<var>n</var> − 2, followed by a hard-coded 1.
</p>
<p>
Okay, now that we understand the enumerative justification for
the recurrence, we can proceed to write the code that generates
it.
</p>
<pre>
function GCR(n, f) {
 if (n == 0) { f(""); return; }
 if (n &lt; 0) { return; }
 GCR(n-1, function(s) { f(s + "1"); });
 GCR(n-2, function(s) { f(s + "10"); });
}
GCR(8, console.log);
</pre>
<p>
The test run calculates all 8-bit allowable sequences.
But wait, there’s a bug:
It shows only the sequences that begin with a 1.
</p>
<p>
If you’re Steve Wozniak, then this bug is a feature,
because the Apple II floppy drive also required the
first bit to be set, so our bug exactly matches the hardware
requirements.
</p>
<p>
But let’s fix our bug. Where did it come from?
</p>
<p>
Our recursive step missed a base case:
The single-digit bit sequence 0 is allowable,
but we rejected it because we thought that it needed
to be separated from the null string by a 1,
to protect against the null string ending in 0.
But the null string doesn’t end in zero, so this protection
was unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
Repairing our base case:
</p>
<pre>
function GCR(n, f) {
 if (n == 0) { f(""); return; }
 if (n == 1) { f("0"); f("1"); return; }
 GCR(n-1, function(s) { f(s + "1"); });
 GCR(n-2, function(s) { f(s + "10"); });
}
</pre>
