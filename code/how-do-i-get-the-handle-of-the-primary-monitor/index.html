<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I get the handle of the primary monitor?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The primary monitor by definition has its upper left corner at
(0, 0).
Therefore, you can use this function:
</p>
<pre>
HMONITOR GetPrimaryMonitorHandle()
{
 const POINT ptZero = { 0, 0 };
 return MonitorFromPoint(ptZero, MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY);
}
</pre>
<p>
To make double extra sure (belt and suspenders),
we also tell it, “If you’re not sure
what monitor to return, give us the primary.”
</p>
<p>
Sure, this sounds obviously simple, but I actually found somebody
who
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/13/629451.aspx">
fumbled around in the dark passing intentionally invalid
parameters</a>
to <code>MonitorFromWindow</code> trying to find one
that would return the primary monitor handle.
(I’ve heard this called <i>Programming By Accident</i>.)</p>
