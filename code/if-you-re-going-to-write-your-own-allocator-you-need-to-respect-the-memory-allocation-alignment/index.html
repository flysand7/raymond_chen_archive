This time, I’m
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/12/10009451.aspx">
not going to set up a story</a>.
I’m just going to go straight to the punch line.
</p>
<p>
A customer overrode the <code>new</code> operator in order to add
additional instrumentation.
Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
struct EXTRASTUFF
{
    DWORD Awesome1;
    DWORD Awesome2;
};
// error checking elided for expository purposes
void *operator new(size_t n)
{
  EXTRASTUFF *extra = (EXTRASTUFF)malloc(sizeof(EXTRASTUFF) + n);
  extra-&gt;Awesome1 = get_awesome_1();
  extra-&gt;Awesome2 = get_awesome_2();
  return ((BYTE *)extra) + sizeof(EXTRASTUFF);
}
// use your imagination to implement
// operators new[], delete, and delete[]
</pre>
<p>
This worked out okay on 32-bit systems because in 32-bit Windows,
<code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT</code> is 8,
and <code>sizeof(EXTRASTUFF)</code> is also 8.
If you start with a value that is a multiple of 8,
then add 8 to it,
the result is still a multiple of 8,
so the pointer returned by the custom
<code>operator new</code> remains properly aligned.
</p>
<p>
But on 64-bit systems, things went awry.
On 64-bit systems,
<code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT</code> is 16,
As a result, the custom
<code>operator new</code> handed out <i>guaranteed-misaligned</i> memory.
</p>
<p>
The misalignment went undetected for a long time,
but the sleeping bug finally woke up when somebody
allocated a structure that contained an
<code>SLIST_ENTRY</code>.
As we saw earlier,
<!-- Why are the alignment requirements for SLIST_ENTRY so different on 64-bit Windows? -->
the
<code>SLIST_ENTRY</code>
really does need to be aligned according to the
<code>MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT</code>,
especially on 64-bit systems,
because 64-bit Windows takes advantage of the extra “guaranteed to be zero”
bits that 16-byte alignment gives you.
If your
<code>SLIST_ENTRY</code> is not 16-byte aligned,
then those “guaranteed to be zero” bits are not actually zero,
and then the algorithm breaks down.
</p>
<p>
Result: Memory corruption and eventually a crash.</p>
