<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the thread parameter to <code>Set­Windows­Hook­Ex</code> actually mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Set­Windows­Hook­Ex</code> function has a <code>dwThreadId</code> parameter for which the documentation says </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>The identifier of the thread with which the hook procedure is to be associated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it mean for a hook procedure to be “associated” with a thread? </p>
<p>Recall that when an event occurs on a thread, the window hook is called from the same thread that the event occurred on. For example, a <code>WH_</code><code>CALL­WND­PROC</code> hook procedure is called when a window procedure is about to be called, and the call occurs on the thread that is about to call the window procedure. </p>
<p>Okay, there are some window hooks that are global in scope, like the low-level input hooks, but you can’t install those per-thread anyway, so the issue is moot. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you have a window hook that can be installed per-thread, then it will be installed only for events on that thread. In the above example, it means that only window procedures on that thread will trigger the hook. </p>
