<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A modest proposal: On allowing mobile phones on airplanes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Ever since the FAA decided to reconsider its ban on the use of cellular phones on airplanes during flight, there has been <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/14/national/main709260.shtml"> quite a reaction</a> over <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TRAVEL/01/30/plane.phone/index.html"> whether this is a good thing</a>.
 To resolve this issue, I present this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal"> modest proposal</a>.
 Remember back in the days when smoking was permitted on airplanes? When you bought a ticket, you were asked whether you wanted to be in the smoking or non-smoking section. We can do the same thing with mobile phones. You can ask to be seated in the “yapping” or “non-yapping” section. If you’re in the yapping section, then yap all you want. Call your grandmother and talk with her the entire flight about her colonoscopy, see if I care. On the other hand, in the non-yapping section, the phone stays off.
 This principle of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/"> yap-or-no-yap</a> can be extended to other in-flight disturbances. The no-yapping section would be renamed the “quiet section”, where electronic devices must be muted (or used with headphones) and conversations must take place at low volume.
 (Hey, <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Simple_Copy_Page&amp;cid=1080080554508&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;ssid=349"> it worked for Amtrak</a>, it can work on airplanes.)
 Side note: I wonder if the temporary ban on carry-on luggage in the UK improved airplane boarding times. Perhaps we could ban carry-on luggage across the board, not as a security measure, but as an efficiency. I don’t know about you, but I’m really anonyed by those people whose “one carry-on bag and one personal item” consist of a carry-on bag the size of a small refrigerator and a personal item the size of a microwave oven. They clog up the aisle for ages trying to heave <strong>both</strong> of their bags into the overhead bin (even though the personal item is supposed to go under the seat in front of you). Okay, enough ranting.</p>
