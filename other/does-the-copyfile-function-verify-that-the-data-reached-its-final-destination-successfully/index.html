<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does the CopyFile function verify that the data reached its final destination successfully?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer had a question about data integrity via file copying.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I am using the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6cfw35a.aspx">
<code>File.Copy</code></a> to copy files from one server to another.
If the call succeeds, am I guaranteed that the data was copied
successfully?
Does the <code>File.Copy</code> method internally perform a file checksum
or something like that to ensure that the data was written correctly?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The
<code>File.Copy</code> method uses the Win32
<code>Copy­File</code> function internally,
so let’s look at <code>Copy­File</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>Copy­File</code> just issues <code>Read­File</code> calls
from the source file and <code>Write­File</code> calls to the
destination file.
(Note: Simplification for purposes of discussion.)
It’s not clear what you are hoping to checksum.
If you want <code>Copy­File</code> to checksum the bytes when
the return from <code>Read­File</code>, and checksum the bytes
as they are passed to
<code>Write­File</code>, and then compare them at the end of
the operation, then that tells you nothing, since they are
the same bytes in the same memory.
</p>
<pre>
while (...) {
 ReadFile(sourceFile, buffer, bufferSize);
 readChecksum.checksum(buffer, bufferSize);
 writeChecksum.checksum(buffer, bufferSize);
 WriteFile(destinationFile, buffer, buffer,Size);
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>read­Checksum</code> and
<code>write­Checksum</code> are identical because they
operate on the same bytes.
(In fact, the compiler might even optimize the code by
merging the calculations together.)
The only way something could go awry is if you have flaky
memory chips that change memory values spontaneously.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the question was whether <code>Copy­File</code> goes
back and reads the file it just wrote out to calculate
the checksum.
But that’s not possible in general, because you might not
have read access on the destination file.
I guess you could have it do a checksum if the destination were
readable, and skip it if not, but then that results in a bunch
of weird behavior:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It generates
    spurious security audits when it tries to read from the destination
    and gets <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code>.</li>
<li>It means that <code>Copy­File</code> sometimes does a checksum
    and sometimes doesn’t, which removes the value of any checksum
    work since you’re never sure if it actually happened.</li>
<li>It doubles the network traffic for a file copy operation,
    leading to weird workarounds from network administrators like
    “Deny read access on files in order to speed up file copies.”</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even if you get past those issues, you have an even bigger problem:
How do you know that reading the file back will really tell you
whether the file was physically copied successfully?
If you just read the data back, it may end up being read out of the
disk cache, in which case you’re not actually verifying physical media.
You’re just comparing cached data to cached data.
</p>
<p>
But if you open the file with caching disabled, this has the side
effect of purging the cache for that file, which means that the
system has thrown away a bunch of data that could have been useful.
(For example, if another process starts reading the file at the same
time.)
And, of course, you’re forcing access to the physical media, which is slowing
down I/O for everybody else.
</p>
<p>
But wait, there’s also the problem of caching controllers.
Even when you tell the hard drive, “Now read this data from the physical
media,”
it may decide to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/09/10059575.aspx">
return the data from an onboard cache instead</a>.
You would have to issue a “No really, flush the data and read it back”
command to the controller to ensure that it’s really reading from
physical media.
</p>
<p>
And even if you verify that, there’s no guarantee that the moment you
declare “The file was copied successfully!” the drive platter won’t
spontaneously develop a bad sector and corrupt the data you just
declared victory over.
</p>
<p>
This is one of those “How far do you really want to go?” type of questions.
You can re-read and re-validate as much as you want at copy time,
and you
<i>still</i> won’t know that the file data is valid when you finally
get around to using it.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes,
you’re better off just trusting the system
to have done what it says it did.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to do some sort of copy verification,
you’d be better off saving the checksum somewhere and having
the ultimate consumer of the data validate the checksum
and raise an integrity error if it discovers corruption.</p>
