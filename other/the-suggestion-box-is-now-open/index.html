<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The suggestion box is now open</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Please post suggestions for future topics in the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/articles/166545.aspx">suggestion box</a> instead of posting off-topic comments. Note that the suggestion box is emptied and read periodically so don’t be surprised if your suggestion vanishes.</p>
<p>And now that there’s a suggestion box, I’m going to prune off-topic comments more aggresively.</p>
