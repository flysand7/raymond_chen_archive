<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can register your child’s name in any language providing you use any Unicode character</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As late as 2015, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151019214055/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/sm/registering-and-naming-your-baby">the rules in Northern Ireland regarding registering the birth of a baby</a> [when the site asks, say you want the Mobile version] specify that “You can register your child’s name in any language providing you use any Unicode character.” </p>
<p>A friend of mine was tempted to see how far he could push that rule. </p>
<p>Could you really name your child U+2603 SNOWMAN or U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO or U+1D5EB MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD CAPITAL X? </p>
<p>And you thought <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">Little Bobby Tables was confusing</a>. Imagine the havoc you could create by naming your child U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT-MARK or U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER or U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK! </p>
<p>This month marks the 25th birthday of Unicode. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/sm/registering-and-naming-your-baby">The original link</a> appears no longer to be valid. Were people naming their kid U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO? <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/registering-and-naming-your-baby">The current rules</a> do not mention the “any Unicode character” part. </p>
