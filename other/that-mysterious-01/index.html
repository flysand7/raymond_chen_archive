<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">That mysterious 01</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, we learned the story of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/23/604741.aspx"> that mysterious J</a>. There is another mystery character that sometimes shows up in place of a smiley face: the \001.
 The character starts out as the Unicode <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/263a/index.htm"> U+263A</a>, which looks like this: ☺. In code page 437, this character lives at position 1, and depending on what program is being used to display the character, it might appear as a box (representing the character U+0001) or as the escape sequence \001.</p>
<p> You can think of this as a version of the mysterious J, but taking a route through code page 437, or you can think of it as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/04/1411080.aspx"> how a bullet turns into a beep</a> taken in reverse, then reversed again. </p>
