<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">No, you can't lock icons to the user's desktop</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In another installment of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/01/922449.aspx"> I bet somebody got a really nice bonus for that feature</a>, I submit this question for your consideration.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> My customer wants to know how to lock a specific icon to the upper left hand corner of the desktop. </p></blockquote>
<p> This company must be writing the most awesome program to end all programs, a program so amazingly awesome that it should appear as the very first thing on the desktop so you won’t forget how awesome it is.
 I think their users may disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p> And the answer is, no, there is no supported way to force a particular icon to appear at a particular desktop position. </p>
