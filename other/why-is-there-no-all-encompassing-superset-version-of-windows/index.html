<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is there no all-encompassing superset version of Windows?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sometimes, I am asked why there is no single version of Windows that contains <strong>everything</strong>. Instead, as you move up the ladder, say, from Windows XP Professional to Windows Server 2003, you gain server features and lose workstation features. Why lose features when you add others?</p>
<p> Because it turns out no actual customer wants to keep the workstation features on their servers. Only developers want to have this “all-encompassing” version of Windows, and making it available to them would result in developers testing their programs on a version of Windows <strong>no actual customer owns</strong>. </p>
<p> I think one of my colleagues who works in security support explained it best: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When customers ask why their server has Internet Explorer, NetMeeting, Media Player, Games, Instant Messenger, <i>etc.</i>, installed by default, it’s hard for the support folks to come up with a good answer. Many customers view each additional installed component as additional risk, and want their servers to have the least possible amount of stuff installed. </p></blockquote>
<p> If you’re the CIO of a bank, the thought that your servers are capable of playing Quake must give you the heebie-jeebies. </p>
