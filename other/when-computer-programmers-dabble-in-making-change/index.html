<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When computer programmers dabble in making change</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My colleague who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/30/8969392.aspx"> dabbled in economics when deciding how many lunch vouchers to buy</a> had a number of other money-related quirks.
 One of the ones that I remember is that when paying for a purchase, my colleague would double the balance and give the cashier that much money. For example, if the total was $5.20, my colleague would hand over $10.40.
 Why?
 Just to see if the cashier reacted when pressing the <i>Enter</i> code appeared to have no effect.
 Total is $5.20.
 Cash tendered is $10.40.
 Change is $5.20.
 Most of the time, the cashier wouldn’t pay any attention. Heck, the cashier wouldn’t even question why my colleague handed over such a strange amount of money.
 Sometimes my colleague would mix it up and instead add $6.66 to the total. For example, if the total was $5.20, my colleague would hand over $11.86, just to see the cashier’s reaction when the cash register indicated that the change due was $6.66.</p>
<p> And then one day, magic happened: <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/armageddon-shopping-list-holy-water-crucifix-tic-tac/827"> The total was $6.66</a>. Without skipping a beat, my colleague handed over $13.32. </p>
