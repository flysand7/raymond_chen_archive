<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Only senior executives can send email to the All Employees distribution list, but mistakes still happen</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, a senior executive sent email to the All Employees distribution list at Microsoft announcing that a particular product was now available for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/02/10191834.aspx"> dogfood</a>. The message included a brief introduction to the product and instructions on how to install it.
 A few hours later, a second message appeared in reply to the announcement. The second message came from a different senior executive, and it went</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I got your note and tried it out. Looks good so far. </p></blockquote>
<p> Oopsie. The second senior executive intended to reply just to the first senior executive, but hit the <i>Reply All</i> button by mistake. This would normally have been caught by the <i>You do not have permission to send mail to <u>All Employees</u></i> rule, but since the mistake was made by a senior executive, that rule did not apply, and the message went out to the entire company.
 People got a good chuckle out of this. At least he didn’t say anything embarrassing.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: I’d have thought that these extra-large distribution lists would be marked <i>Nobody can send to this distribution list</i>, and then when somebody needed to send a message to the entire company, the email admins would create a one-day-only rule which allowed a specific individual to send one message. </p>
