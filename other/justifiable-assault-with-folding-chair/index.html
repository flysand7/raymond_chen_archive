[<a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/output.aspx?Article_ID=3834354&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=1">Local coverage</a>.] What got me was this fellow Jesse Sandler: </p>

<p> “They were getting in front of me and I was there a lot earlier than them, so I thought that it was just,” he said. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Because if somebody cuts in front of you in line, you are perfectly justified in assaulting them with a folding chair. That’s one of the guiding principles this country was founded on. </p>
