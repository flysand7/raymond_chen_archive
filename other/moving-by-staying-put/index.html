<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Moving by staying put</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/"> Michael Kaplan</a> opined on his distaste for office moves, particular the ones for which <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/10/02/5233452.aspx"> there appears to be very little benefit</a>. One of his options was “interview with whatever group moves into Building 24 and work for them instead.”
 Many years ago, an organizational change to the project I was working on resulted in my group ceasing to exist. The reason isn’t important to the story; what’s important is that the members of that group were redeployed to other parts of the project. At the time, I hadn’t yet learned that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx"> material goods are a burden</a>, and I dreaded moving offices because of all the packing and unpacking I would have to do.
 Solution: Join whatever group was moving into my hallway on the condition that I get to keep my office.</p>
<p> They gladly accepted the terms of this agreement. </p>
