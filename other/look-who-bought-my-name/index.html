<p>Commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/articles/407234.aspx#630316"> Pavel Vozenilek noticed</a> that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=raymond+chen"> if you type my name into Google</a>, there is only one sponsored link, and it’s from Google themselves, inviting you to apply for a job there. (<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1473225,00.asp">Maybe</a> <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/17/HNgooglefranceadwords_1.html"> I</a> <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2006/02/06/daily28.html"> should</a> <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_3937517">sue</a>. Perhaps I can get <a href="http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/3547356"> a settlement</a>.)
 When I mentioned this to some other people at Microsoft, they started hunting around to see what sort of ads came up on Google when they searched for other names. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=eric+gunnerson"> Eric Gunnerson</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=brad+abrams"> Brad Abrams</a> are available at low prices, and you can get <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=randy+holloway"> Randy Holloway</a> on eBay. Of all the Microsoft bloggers, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=larry+osterman"> the only other one that gets the Google Jobs treatment is Larry Osterman</a>.
 (Note: All links behaved as described when I originally wrote this entry; due to the nature of sponsored links, they may behave differently by the time you read this.)</p>
<p> [9am update: Wow that was fast. The Google Jobs links for Larry Osterman and me are already gone.] </p>
