<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What tools should I assume everybody has?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My code samples assume you are using the latest header files from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/"> Platform SDK</a> (free download), the one that includes support for Win64. If you have an older SDK then you won’t have various new data types like UINT_PTR and INT_PTR and should just use UINT and INT.
 I write code that is Win64-compliant as a matter of course since all code in Windows must be Win64-compliant. Writing noncompliant code is as foreign to me as it would be for a chess player to consider the ramifications of an illegal move. It doesn’t even enter my mind.</p>
<p> The question for readers: Should I assume that everybody has the latest header files? Or should I write old-style code (that won’t run on Win64)? </p>
