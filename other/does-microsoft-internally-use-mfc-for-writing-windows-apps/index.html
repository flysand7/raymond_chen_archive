<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does Microsoft internally use MFC for writing Windows apps?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Craig Ward figures that if he asks enough questions I might answer one of them. “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#408420">Does Microsoft internally use MFC for writing Windows apps? How about VB?</a>”
 People use whatever they decide best meets the requirements for the task at hand. That could be a batch file, a C++ program, a perl script, a web page with a bunch of JScript, use your imagination. Is the number of solutions that use MFC and VB nonzero? I don’t know for sure (I’m not in the habit of taking all the programs I see and trying to figure out what language they’re written in), but I’d be very surprised if somebody somewhere hasn’t thrown together an MFC or VB program to do <i>something</i>, be it a test suite, an install script, a graphical interface over a complicated command-line tool, or something else. It’s a big company. I understand that in some parts of the company <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/"> they even use Macintoshes</a>.</p>
<p> I’m not going to go into details of specific projects because (3) I am not authorized to talk about it. (I gave <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/25/496955.aspx#497180"> reasons one and two</a> two years ago.) </p>
