<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Where does an IT guy from a major hotel chain stay at the PDC?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I believe it was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/marcmill/"> Marc Miller</a> who related this story to me at the PDC. He was chatting with someone whose name badge identified him as an employee from a major high-end hotel chain. Marc joked, “Well, I think it’s obvious which hotel you’re staying at.”</p>
<p> “Oh no,” the gentleman replied. “They won’t let me stay there. Too expensive.” </p>
