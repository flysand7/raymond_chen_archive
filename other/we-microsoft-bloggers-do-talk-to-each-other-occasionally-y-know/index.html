<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">We Microsoft bloggers do talk to each other occasionally, y’know</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Every so often, somebody will spam all the Microsoft blogs with a survey or a plea for a job or some other boilerplate message. Don’t think you’re fooling anyone. It’s not like each blogger lives in a separate world and never talks to anyone else. In reality, we exchange information quite freely and even occasionally get together—usually under the aegis of our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/"> overworked leader Betsy</a>—for an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2005/04/13/407995.aspx"> informal face-to-face</a> (usually <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/11/479588.aspx"> lubricated with beer</a>).</p>
<p> Which reminds me: That April get-together was held at <a href="http://www.fadoirishpub.com/fado_directions.php?city=seattle"> Fadó Seattle</a>, and at some point during the evening, I excused myself and went into the main part of the pub. I headed for what appeared to be a promising hallway, but which instead was merely a large wall covered in thematic decorations. I scanned the wall for a few seconds, then someone walking past said to me, “It’s over there, through that room, on your left.” </p>
<p> I found it intriguing that the gentleman knew exactly what I was looking for based on the fact that I was staring at a wall at the edge of a bar near the kitchen entrance. </p>
