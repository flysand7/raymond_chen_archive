<p>
Prerequisite:

Understanding what <code>__purecall</code> means</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was asked to help diagnose an issue in which a program managed to stumble
into the <code>__purecall</code> function.
</p>
<pre>
XYZ!_purecall:
00a14509 a100000000      mov     eax,dword ptr ds:[00000000h] ds:0023:00000000=????????
</pre>
<p>
The stack at the point of failure looked like this:
</p>
<pre>
XYZ!_purecall
XYZ!CViewFrame::SetFrame+0x14d
XYZ!CViewFrame::SetPresentation+0x355
XYZ!CViewFrame::BeginView+0x1fe
</pre>
<p>
The line at <code>XYZ!CViewFrame::SetFrame</code> that
called the mystic <code>__purecall</code> was a simple <code>AddRef</code>:
</p>
<pre>
  pSomething-&gt;AddRef(); // crashes in __purecall
</pre>
<p>
From what we know of <code>__purecall</code>,
this means that somebody called into a virtual method on a derived
class after the derived class’s destructor has run.
Okay, well, let’s see if we can find the object in question.
Since the method being called is a COM method,
the <code>__stdcall</code> calling convention applies,
which means that the <code>this</code> pointer is on the stack.

Using our knowledge of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/05/68017.aspx">
the layout of a COM object</a>,
we can navigate through memory to find the vtable.
</p>
<pre>
0:023&gt; dps 06a88d58
06a88d58  009b2eac XYZ!CRegistrationSink::`vftable'
06a88d5c  06b20058
06a88d60  00000002
06a88d64  00998930 XYZ!CObjectWithBrush::`vftable'
06a88d68  00000000
06a88d6c  009c9c80 XYZ!CBrowseSite::`vftable'
06a88d70  009c9c70 XYZ!CBrowseSite::`vftable'
06a88d74  00000000
....
0:023&gt; dps 009b2eac
009b2eac  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual QueryInterface() = 0
009b2eb0  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual AddRef() = 0
009b2eb4  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual Release() = 0
009b2eb8  009cb1e4 XYZ!CRegistrationSink::Register
009b2ebc  009b3d2d XYZ!CRegistrationSink::Unregister
</pre>
<p>
We see that the object has been destructed down to the
<code>CRegistrationSink</code> base class,
and the attempt to increment its reference count has led us
into the abyss of <code>__purecall</code>.
</p>
<p>
But what was this object before it descended into madness?
</p>
<p>
Well, we know that the object was something derived from
<code>CRegistrationSink</code>.
And the other values in memory tell us that the object most
likely also derived from
<code>CObjectWithBrush</code>
and <code>CBrowseSite</code>.
Just for fun, here’s the <code>CObjectWithBrush</code> vtable,
to confirm that we destructed down to that point:
</p>
<pre>
00998930  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual QueryInterface() = 0
00998934  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual AddRef() = 0
00998938  00a14509 XYZ!_purecall // virtual Release() = 0
0099893c  0099880d XYZ!CObjectWithBrush::SetBrush
00998940  00a319ee XYZ!CObjectWithBrush::GetBrush
00998944  00a13fd9 XYZ!CObjectWithBrush::`scalar deleting destructor'
</pre>
<p>
Ooh, it looks like <code>CObjectWithBrush</code> has a
virtual destructor.
Probably to destroy the brush.
</p>
<p>
A check of the source code tells us that nobody derives from
<code>CBrowseSite</code>, so that is almost certainly the
original object type.
</p>
<p>
As a cross-check, we check whether what we have matches
the memory layout of a <code>CBrowseSite</code>:
</p>
<pre>
0:023&gt; dt XYZ!CBrowseSite 06a88d58
   +0x000 __VFN_table : 0x009b2eac
   +0x004 m_prgreg         : 0x06a88d58 Registration
   +0x008 m_creg           : 2
   +0x00c __VFN_table : 0x00998930
   +0x010 m_hbr            : (null)
   +0x014 __VFN_table : 0x009c9c80
   +0x018 __VFN_table : 0x009c9c70
   +0x01c m_cRef           : 0
</pre>
<p>
Looks not unreasonable.
(Well, aside from the fact that we have a bug…)
The object has most likely begun its destruction because its
reference count (<code>_cRef</code>) went to zero.
</p>
<p>
At this point, there was enough information to ask the developers
responsible for
<code>CViewFrame</code> and <code>CBrowseSite</code> to work out
how the <code>CViewFrame</code> ended up running around with a pointer
to an object that has already been destructed.</p>
