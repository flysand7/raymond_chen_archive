<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">From inside the Redmond Reality Distortion Field: Why publish documents in PDF?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few years ago, the Windows 7 team developed a document to introduce technology writers to the features of Windows 7. The document was released in PDF format, which created quite a stir among certain people trapped inside <a href="http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=486"> the Redmond Reality Distortion Field</a>, who indignantly complained,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Why are we releasing this document in PDF format? Shouldn’t it be in docx or XPS? I would expect people interested in Windows 7 to be willing to use more Microsoft technology. </p></blockquote>
<p> Um, hello from the real world. It’s the people who are critical of Windows 7 who are <i>least</i> likely to use Microsoft technology!
 “Okay, so Microsoft has this document telling me about their new product, but it’s <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=35"> in some Microsoft proprietary file format that requires me to install a custom viewer that works only in Internet Explorer</a>? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”
 No wonder people hate Microsoft.
 It’s like handing out brochures titled “Gründe, warum du Deutsch lernen solltest.”</p>
<p> <b>Bonus plug</b>: Stephen Toulouse <a href="http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=641"> bookified his blogerations</a>. (<a href="http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=642">Part 2: The Hardbackening</a>.) I’ve read the softcopy of his book. Good stuff. And I would’ve endorsed his book even if he didn’t promise me a personalized copy. </p>
