<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It's that season again: The 2007 Microsoft Company Meeting</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Yes, it’s that time of year again, time for the annual Microsoft Company Meeting, and therefore time for another of Raymond’s reminiscences about meetings past. (If you want a report on the meeting itself, I’m sure <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/"> Mini-Microsoft</a> will oblige. Here’s the <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2007/09/microsoft-company-meeting-ahoy.html"> company meeting preview</a>.) </p>
<p> Over a decade ago, one of my colleagues informally organized a bike ride to the company meeting. (I didn’t go; this was before I had taken up bicycling.) He got a small group of people from the organization to join him, and as they headed out in the morning, they “<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/accidentally-on-purpose.html">accidentally</a>” made a wrong turn and headed towards North Bend instead of Seattle. By the time they “realized their mistake” it was too late, and they were “forced” to bicycle through rural King County, arriving back at work just as the meeting ended. </p>
