<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I change a registry key from within the debugger?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you are using a debugger based on the Windows debugging engine, you can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562389(v=vs.85).aspx">!dreg</a> command to dump a registry key, but what if you want to modify a registry key? </p>
<p>I don’t know how often it happens to you, but it happens to us a lot here inside Microsoft: You are given a remote debugging connection to a process that is running on some computer to which you have no physical access. You therefore cannot just run <code>regedit</code> and do your registry work there. You may also be in a situation where you don’t want to run <code>regedit</code> because running another process would interfere with the issue you are debugging.¹ </p>
<p>One way to set a registry key from inside the debugger is to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">simulate a call to the <code>Reg­Set­Value­Ex</code> function</a>. </p>
<p>Or you can think outside the box: Use the <code>.shell</code> command and shell out to <code>reg.exe</code>. </p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; .shell reg add hkcu\Software\Contoso /v UseWarpCore /t REG_DWORD /d 1
</pre>
<p>This assumes that the debugger was created without the <code>-noshell</code> option. Otherwise, you’re back to simulating the call. </p>
<p>¹ Usually because you are debugging some focus-related problem, and running <code>regedit</code> changes focus. Or, if you work in my building, because you are debugging Explorer itself and therefore cannot launch any new programs. </p>
