<p> Whereas <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2005/09/07/461962.aspx"> Eric Carter will be signing</a> his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2005/06/06/425847.aspx"> book (co-authored with another Eric)</a> at the PDC. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/08/55204.aspx"> I have no book of my own to sign</a>, but will be happy to sign the Erics’ book if you ask me to! <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/17/452631.aspx"> You can catch me in the Fundamentals Lounge</a> pretty much the whole time. </p>
<p> There have been some changes to my talk since I wrote about it last time. The lecture style is gone; the material simply didn’t support it. It’s just going to be a conventional talk against a series of slides. I sort of painted myself into a corner with my title, <a href="http://commnet.microsoftpdc.com/content/SessionView.aspx?SessionID=8acd4162-adb9-4a37-98db-720e7b6e3a48"> Five Things Every Win32 Developer Should Know</a>: If you should know it, then it can’t be all that advanced can it? As a result, my talk is really more of a high 200’s/low 300’s type of talk. But maybe just collecting all these factoids in one place makes it worthy of a 400 rating? </p>
