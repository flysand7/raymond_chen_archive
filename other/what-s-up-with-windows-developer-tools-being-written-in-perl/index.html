<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s up with Windows developer tools being written in perl?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Worf noticed that a number of developer tools are written in perl and wonders <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/#comment-915293">what’s up with that</a>. </p>
<p>Simple: Perl is a socially-acceptable form of Visual Basic. </p>
<p>In other words, just like how Visual Basic is a great way to throw together a quick little GUI program, perl is a great way to throw together a quick little developer tool. In both cases, the language is loose enough to let you get away with a lot of sloppy coding techniques, and a lack of discipline can result in an unreadable mess.¹ </p>
<p>The difference is that whereas people look down on Visual Basic programmers as talentless hacks who couldn’t code their way out of a paper bag, people look at perl programmers as wizards who can perform miracles with their arcane incantations that to the uninitiated are indistinguishable from line noise.² </p>
<p>¹ I’m not saying that the developer tools are an unreadable mess. Just that it’s easy to write an unreadable mess in perl. </p>
<p>² You can tell I’m an old timer because I said “line noise”. Kids these days have never experienced line noise. </p>
