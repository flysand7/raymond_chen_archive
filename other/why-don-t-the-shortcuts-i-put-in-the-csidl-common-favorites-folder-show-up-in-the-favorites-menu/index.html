<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why don't the shortcuts I put in the CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES folder show up in the Favorites menu?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer created some shortcuts in the <code>CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES</code> folder, expecting them to appear in the Favorites menu for all users. Instead, they appeared in the Favorites menu for <i>no</i> users. Why isn’t <code>CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES</code> working?
 The <code>CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES</code> value was added at the same time as the other <code>CSIDL_COMMON_*</code> values, and its name strongly suggests that its relationship to <code>CSIDL_FAVORITES</code> is the same as the relationship between <code>CSIDL_COMMON_STARTMENU</code> and <code>CSIDL_STARTMENU</code>, or between <code>CSIDL_COMMON_PROGRAMS</code> and <code>CSIDL_PROGRAMS</code>, or between <code>CSIDL_COMMON_DESKTOP­DIRECTORY</code> and <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP­DIRECTORY</code>.
 That suggestion is a false one.
 In fact, <code>CSIDL_COMMON_FAVORITES</code> is not hooked up to anything. It’s another of those vestigial values that got <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/25/5658731.aspx"> created with the intent of actually doing something</a> but that thing never actually happened. I don’t think any version of Internet Explorer ever paid any attention to that folder. Maybe the designers decided that it was a bad idea and cut the feature. Maybe it was an oversight. Whatever the reason, it’s just sitting there wasting space.
 Sorry for the fake-out.</p>
<p> <b>Exercise</b>: Another customer wanted to know why creating a <code>%ALL­USERS­PROFILE%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch</code> directory and putting shortcuts into it did not result in those shortcuts appearing in every user’s Quick Launch bar. Explain. </p>
