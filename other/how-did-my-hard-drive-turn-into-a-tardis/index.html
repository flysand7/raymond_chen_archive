<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How did my hard drive turn into a TARDIS?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer observed that the entry for a network drive looked liked this in My Computer, well, except that there was a network drive icon instead of ASCII art.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI' sans-serif;font-size: 80%" summary="3.81 terabytes free of 2.5 gigabytes">
<tr>
<td rowspan="3" style="font-size: 300%"><u>O</u></td>
<td>Public (\\server) (S:)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid gray .75pt">

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="color: #404040">3.81TB free of 2.5GB</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> How is it possible for a 2.5<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">GB</a> drive to have 3.81TB free?
 While there have certainly been examples of Explorer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/15/10140985.aspx"> showing confusing values</a> the reason for the strange results was, at least this time, not Explorer’s fault.</p>
<p> This particular network drive actually reported (via <code>Get­Disk­Free­Space­Ex</code>) that it had more free space than drive space. Explorer is dutifully reporting the information it was given, because it doesn’t try to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/12/26/10251026.aspx"> second-guess the file system</a>. If a network drive wants to report that it is a TARDIS, then it’s a TARDIS. </p>
