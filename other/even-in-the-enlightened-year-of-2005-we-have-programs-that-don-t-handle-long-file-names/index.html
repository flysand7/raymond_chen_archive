<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Even in the enlightened year of 2005, we have programs that don’t handle long file names</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When I saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/">Tim Sneath</a>‘s description of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2005/09/28/474977.aspx"> the root cause for all the Windows Vista product key problems</a>, I was amazed that the reason was something my readers tend to go completely ballistic over: Long file names. </p>
<p> It so happens that one of the ISO mounting tools that people were using for installing Windows Vista doesn’t support long file names! (At least not by default.) </p>
