<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">First, try reading the error message, episode 2: Even programmers see error messages without reading them</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
I will occasionally note that users don’t read error messages;
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/01/54734.aspx">
they just click Cancel</a>.
And the phenomenon isn’t just restricted to naïve users.
Even programmers ignore error messages.
All they see is “Blah blah blah an error occurred.”
</p>
<p>
For example, there’s this message that appeared
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/04/8014283.aspx">
on a peer-to-peer discussion group</a>:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">

I tried to submit an update to our database and I got this error.
What does it mean?
Is the error on the client or the server?
</p>
<pre>
Opening transaction 34508.
Locking record 14 for update.
Updating record 14 in table BLUECHEESE.
Operation failed.
write: The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
</pre>
<p>
When I try to view the record to see whether my update made it,
I get this error:
</p>
<pre>
The database may be corrupt; it requires administrator attention.
To protect the database, it has been taken offline.
</pre>

I’m no expert here, but it looks like a write operation failed
because the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
Since you’re updating a record on the server, it’s probably a
corruption problem on the server.
(After all, there’s no change taking place on the client.
The client is just asking the server to do the work.)
</p>
<p>
And the second error message seems to suggest that the database
may be corrupt and requires administrator attention.
As a precautionary measure, the database took itself offline
so the corruption can’t spread.
I’m pretty sure that’s a server-side thing, since the database
is on the server.
