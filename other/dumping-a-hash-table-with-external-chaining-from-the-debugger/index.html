<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dumping a hash table with external chaining from the debugger</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
I was doing some crash dump debugging, as I am often called upon to do,
and one of the data structure I had to grovel through was something
that operated basically like an atom table, so that’s what I’ll call
it.
Like an atom table,
it manages a collection of strings.
You can add a string to the table (getting a unique value back,
which we will call an atom),
and later you can hand it the atom and it will give you the string back.
It looked something like this:
</p>
<pre>
struct ENTRY
{
  ENTRY *next;
  UINT   atom;
  PCWSTR value;
};
#define ATOMTABLESIZE 19
struct ATOMTABLE
{
  ENTRY *buckets[ATOMTABLESIZE];
};
</pre>
<p>
(It didn’t actually look like this; I’ve reduced it to the smallest
example that still illustrates my point.)
</p>
<p>
As part of my debugging, I had an atom and needed to look it up
in the table.
A program would do this by simply calling the
“here is an atom, please give me the string” function,
but since this was a crash dump,
there’s nothing around to execute anything.
(Not that having a live machine would’ve made things much easier,
because this was a kernel-mode crash,
so you don’t get any of this edit-and-continue froofy stuff.
This is <i>real debugging</i>™.)
</p>
<p>
But even though the crashed system can’t execute anything,
the <i>debugger</i> can execute stuff,
and the debugger engine used by <code>kd</code>
comes with its own mini-programming language.
Here’s how I dumped the atom table:
</p>
<pre>
// note: this was entered all on one line
// broken into two lines for readability
0: kd&amp;gt .for (r $t0=0; @$t0 &lt; 0n19; r $t0=@$t0+1)
         { dl poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8) 99 2 }
fffff8a0`06ad3b90  fffff8a0`037a3fc0 fffff8a0`0000000c \

fffff8a0`03b9e390  00000000`00000000 00240000`00000071 /
...

<p>
Let’s take that weirdo command apart one piece at a time.
</p>
<p>
The overall command is
</p>
<pre>
.for (a; b; c) { d }
</pre>
<p>
This operates the same as the C programming language.
(<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/23/10167156.aspx#10167462">Sorry, Delphi programmers</a>,
for yet another C-centric example.)
In our case,
we use the <code>$t0</code> pseudo-register as our loop control.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r $t0=0</code>
    — this sets <code>$t0</code> to zero
<li><code>@$t0 &lt; 0n19</code>
    — this stops once <code>$t0</code> reaches 19.
<li><code>r $t0=@$t0+1</code>
    — this increments <code>$t0</code>.
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Note that here as well as in the loop body, I prefix the register
name with the <code>@</code> character when I want to obtain its value,
in order to force it to be interpreted as a register.
(Otherwise, the debugger will look for a symbol called <code>$t0</code>.)
</p>
<p>
The command being executed at each iteration is
<code>{ dl poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8) 99 2 }</code>.
Let’s break this down, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dl</code>
    — this command dumps a singly-linked list.
<li><code>poi (fffff8a0`06b69930+@$t0*8)</code>
    — this is the head of the linked list.
    In this example,
    <code>0xfffff8a0`06b69930</code>
    is the address of the <code>buckets</code> array,
    so we add the loop counter times the size of a pointer (8, in
    this case) to get the address of the <code>$t0</code>‘th entry,
    and then dereference it (<code>poi</code>) to get the address
    of the head of the linked list.
<li><code>99</code>
    — This is the maximum length of the linked list.
    I picked an arbitrary large-enough number.
    I like using 9’s because it carries the most value per keypress.
    Other people like to use nice round numbers like <code>1000</code>,
    but <code>999</code> saves you a whole keypress and is just one less.
    (On the other hand, I don’t use <code>fff</code> because that runs
    the risk of being misinterpreted as a symbol.)
<li><code>2</code>
    —
    This is the number of pointer-sized objects to dump at the start
    of each node.
    For 32-bit code, I use 4, whereas for 64-bit code, I use 2.
    Why those values?
    Because those are the maximum number of pointer-sized objects that
    the debugger will print on one line.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Okay, so now I have that linked list dump.
The value I’m looking for is the <code>atom</code> whose value
is <code>0x3F</code>, so I skim down the last column looking
for <code>0000003f</code>, and hey there it is.
</p>
<pre>
fffff8a0`037a4700  fffff8a0`01f96fb0 00000000`<u>0000003f</u>
</pre>
<p>
Now I have my <code>ENTRY</code>, and I can dump it to see what
the corresponding value is.
</p>
<pre>
0: kd&gt; dt contoso!ENTRY fffff8a0`037a4700
    +0x000 next: 0xfffff8a0`01f96fb0
    +0x008 atom: 0x0000003f
    +0x010 value: 0xffff8a0`01f97e20 -&gt; "foo"
</pre>
