<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My initial confusion when encountering functions whose names begin with <code>Co</code></h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My formal education is in mathematics. In this highly abstract world, you spend a lot of time working with various types of duality and dual spaces. In general terms, a dual of a concept X is a special type of function (a <i>homomorphism</i>) that takes an X and produces a scalar. The convention in mathematics for dual spaces is that the <i>co-</i> prefix denotes the dual.</p>
<p>For example, in linear algebra, the dual of a <i>vector</i> is a <i>covector</i>: A <i>covector</i> is a special kind of function (<i>linear operator</i>) that operates on vectors. (If you’re an engineer, then a vector is a column of numbers, and a covector is a row of numbers, with function application being the usual matrix product.)</p>
<p>In Windows, COM functions generally begin with the prefix <code>Co-</code>: <code>Co­Initialize</code>, <code>Co­Create­Instance</code>, <code>Co­Register­ClassObject</code>. The <code>Co-</code> prefix is just a namespace disambiguator, just like how shell functions begin with <code>SH-</code> and native system services begin with <code>Zw-</code> (which <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/what-does-the-zw-prefix-mean-"> doesn’t stand for anything</a>).</p>
<p>The first time I encountered these COM functions, it was in a meeting, when somebody said something like, “You need to call <code>Co­Create­Instance</code> with…” I came from a world where the <i>co-</i> prefix represented mathematical duality, so I assumed that this mysterious function somehow created a dual object. You took this dual object, applied it to another object, and out came a number! I then spent some time trying to figure out what this dual object could look like, and how it could be useful.</p>
<p>But of course it wasn’t any such thing. It was just “create an instance of an object.”</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the 2019 International Mathematical Olympiad.</p>
