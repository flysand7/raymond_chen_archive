<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">MSDN content is also available as a Web service</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Unless you’ve been living under a rock, by now you know about MSDN’s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/innovation/archive/2009/04/22/launching-low-bandwidth-loband-v1-and-new-ide-view.aspx"> low bandwidth view (aka ScriptFree)</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/innovation/archive/2009/10/26/launching-lightweight-beta-view-for-msdn-library.aspx"> lightweight</a> view. But there are other views too, like PDA view (for when you want to look up MSDN documentation on your phone?), Robot view, printer-friendly view, unstyled HTML view… (See that first link above for more details.) </p>
<p> But in addition to all the views, you can go directly to the back-end that drives all the data: The <a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"> MSDN/TechNet Publish System (MTPS) Content Service</a>. With that interface, you can request the back-end data and format it any way you like. Here’s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163541.aspx"> an MSDN Magazine article which builds a documentation viewer</a>, and <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/"> the author of that article</a> also developed <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27288.aspx"> a command-line tool which returns the content as a man page</a>. (Update: Looks like the command-line tool no longer exists. Sorry, all you retro-heads out there.) </p>
