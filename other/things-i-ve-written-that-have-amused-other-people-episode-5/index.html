<p>A question was sent to an internal discussion list for users of the XYZ tool:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>From</b>: Q<br/> <b>To</b>: XYZ Users  The GHI function in the JKL tool doesn’t work for me. «description of problem deleted» </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I responded with this message:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>To</b>: Q, XYZ Users  The JKL tool is not part of XYZ. You should contact the author of the JKL tool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The reason why people were amused by this is that the author of the JKL tool is <i>me</i>. (Says so right there in the online help.)</p>
<p> As a final punch line, the person never did contact me. </p>
