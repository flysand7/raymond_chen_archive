<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Meet the authors: Mario Hewardt and Daniel Pravat, authors of Advanced Windows Debugging</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My colleague Mario Hewart just let me know that <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Preconference.aspx#advanced-windows-debugging">he and Daniel Pravat will be presenting at the PDC pre-con</a>. In case you don’t recognize the names, they’re the authors of <i>Advanced Windows Debugging</i>, a book which I reviewed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/18/6794821.aspx"> late last year</a>.</p>
<p> So if you want to get your debugging tips directly from the source, you know where to go. </p>
<p> Besides, Mario speaks Swedish, so he’s already awesome by default. </p>
<p> [Raymond is currently away; this message was pre-recorded.] </p>
