<p> A bug report came in: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When I go to the <i>Power Options</i> control panel and select <i>Edit Plan Settings</i>, the <i>Turn off display</i> combo-box is disabled. Is this a bug? </p></blockquote>
<p> Shortly thereafter, this response was submitted: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Do you see a big yellow warning over the <i>Turn off display</i> that says that some settings are managed by your system administrator, and a link called <font color="blue"><u>Why can’t I change some settings?</u></font> </p></blockquote>
<p> The reply: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Yes, my machine is joined to a domain, and I see that yellow warning. </p></blockquote>
<p> This is a fact of life. People can’t see what is right in front of their face. Even though there’s a warning right above the disabled item explaining that it can’t be changed due to an administrative setting, even though there’s a link on the page whose text directly addresses the issue they are asking about, even though they <i>confirm the existence of the explanatory text when asked</i>, they still don’t read it or understand it. It’s another case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness"> inattentional blindness</a>. You are so focused on the task of clicking on the combobox that you completely disregard any other information because you simply aren’t expecting it to be there. </p>
