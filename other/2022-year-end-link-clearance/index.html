<p>Here begins the year-end link clearance.</p>
<ul>
<li>This has always bothered me: Pinocchio is a story by an Italian author set in Italy about a puppet with an Italian name. But the Pinnochio-themed restaurant in Disneyland is named <i>Pinocchio Village Haus</i> and has Bavarian architecture. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnhLUqWmjg"> Why is Pinocchio’s Disney Restaurant German?</a>. Furthermore, why does it serve American food?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gawker.com/culture/six-days-with-a-big-lollipop"> Six days with a big lollipop: I completed America’s most disgusting treat</a>. Fran Hoepfner undertakes an ill-advised journey.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bernadettebanner"> Bernadette Banner</a> creates historical reconstructions of pre-World War I clothing. As an April Fool’s joke, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSxQHQ_1gX4"> created an OnlyFans account for saucy Victorian ankle pics</a>. Leaving aside the saucy content, and the stunning amount of talent required for the entire undertaking, my favorite part was her taking a selfie, dressed in Victorian clothes, <a href="https://youtu.be/fSxQHQ_1gX4?t=571">with the aid of a drone</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/08/31/us-open-tennis-ballperson/"> Do you have what it takes to be a U.S. Open ball person</a>? I had always wondered how you got that job. I had also wondered about how the job is done. I found the answers in <a href="http://assets.usta.com/assets/1/USTA_Import/USTA/dps/doc_13_19883.pdf"> Ball Persons: A Training Manual</a>, which outlines where and how to position yourself, how to deliver a ball to a player, and (my favorite) the protocols for moving balls around the court.</li>
<li>History/fraud/self-aggrandizement corner: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfOUVYQnuhw"> The maddening mess of airport codes!</a> (16 minute video for process and history nerds). <a href="https://youtu.be/Qe5WT22-AO8"> The man who tried to fake an element</a> (90 minute video for fraud and history nerds), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0twDETh6QaI"> ROBLOX_OOF.mp3: The origin of the Roblox “OOF” sound</a> (120 minute video for self-aggrandizement nerds), <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/the-reporters-63622746"> How the great online toaster hoax was exposed</a> (2000 words for fraud and prankster nerds).</li>
<li>I don’t know much about NASCAR or auto racing, but I was tipped off to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3yNc5EasW8"> Ross Chastain intentionally sustaining heavy damage to his car by using a video game move on the final turn</a> to sneak into fourth place and advance to the next round. (One thing I found interesting was the illuminated pit signs at 1:21, which look like augmented reality just floating out there.) From what I can gather, this took advantage of a slow turn before the finish, and it was a very risky and dangerous move. I also found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpqxnYdBeXo"> Dale Jr. and Steve Letarte discussing the incident</a>, and I really admire Letarte’s style: Calm and extremely knowledgeable.</li>
<li>Machine learning models are all the rage. <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/"> AI Weirdness</a> asks simple questions and gets weird answers. Holiday-themed examples: <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/ai-generated-valentines-cards/"> Valentine’s Cards</a>. <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/candy-heart-messages-written-by-a-18-02-09/"> Candy heart messages</a>. <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/halloween-candy/"> Hallowe’en candy</a>. <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/predicting-the-next-toy-fads-with-ai/"> Toy fads</a>.</li>
<li>C++11 introduced <i>uniform initialization</i>, but uniform initialization of vectors is subtle. <a href="https://medium.com/@barryrevzin/uniform-initialization-isnt-82533d3b9c11"> Uniform initialization isn’t</a>. I have been bitten by the <code>w2</code> example, and the results were not pretty.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ends the year-end link clearance.</p>
