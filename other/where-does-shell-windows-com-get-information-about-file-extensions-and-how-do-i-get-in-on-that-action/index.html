<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Where does shell.windows.com get information about file extensions, and how do I get in on that action?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you double-click a file for which there is no registered handler, Windows will offer to visit the Web service on shell.windows.com to locate a program that can open it. But where does this information come from, and how can you add your program to the database?</p>
<p> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929149"> Knowledge Base article Q929149</a>, titled <i>Windows File Association System <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/22/8530603.aspx"> On-Boarding</a> Process</i>, provides step-by-step instructions on how you can add your file extension. </p>
<p> If you look at the existing entries on shell.windows.com, most of them have relatively straightforward and neutral descriptions. “<a href="http://shell.windows.com/fileassoc/0409/xml/redir.asp?Ext=ppt">This document is a PowerPoint presentation</a>.” “<a href="http://shell.windows.com/fileassoc/0409/xml/redir.asp?Ext=mp3">This document is a sound file</a>.” But there is at least one company that decided to use the file association service for a bit of grandstanding. “<a href="http://shell.windows.com/fileassoc/0409/xml/redir.asp?Ext=pdf">Invented by XYZ company and perfected over 15 years</a>, ABC file format lets you capture information from any application, on any computer, and share it with anyone around the world.” </p>
<p> By the way, if the file association Web service offends you, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490825.aspx"> you can disable it</a>. </p>
