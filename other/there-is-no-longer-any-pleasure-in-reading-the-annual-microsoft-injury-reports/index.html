<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">There is no longer any pleasure in reading the annual Microsoft injury reports</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Microsoft is required by law to file reports on employees who have sustained injuries on the job. They are also required to post the reports in a location where employees can see them. These reports come out every year on February 1.
 Back in the old days, these reports were filled out by hand, and reading them was oddly amusing for the details. My favorite from the mid 1990’s was a report on an employee who was injured on the job, and the description was simply <i>pencil lead embedded in hand</i>.
 Sadly, the reports are now computerized, and there isn’t a place to describe the nature of each injury. It’s just a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p> Numbers are nice, but they don’t tell a story in quite the same way. </p>
