<p>While chasing down a bug, I ran across this comment: </p>
<pre>
// Arbitrary cap on message length.
// If you change the format string, then update this to match.
// (Although, if we ever need to place a million icons on the desktop,
// I am going to quit and become a barista.)
</pre>
<p>But the buffer was not big enough. Should I suggest to the developer that they check if Starbucks is hiring? </p>
<p>The buffer wasn’t big enough because the format string was incorrect. </p>
<pre>
constexpr wchar_t formatString[] = L"(%f3.3,%f3.3)";
constexpr size_t worstCaseFormat = ARRAYSIZE(L"(000.000,000.000)");
</pre>
<p>I guess they never looked at their log file, because the format string is wrong. For an icon at position (10, 10), the resulting log message is <tt>(10.0000003.3,10.0000003.3)</tt>, which is longer than the allotted worst-case string. </p>
<p>That’s because the format string <code>%f3.3</code> is interpreted as </p>
<ul>
<li><code>%f</code>: A formatted floating point number,     with a default of six places after the decimal. </li>
<li><code>3.3</code>: The literal characters <tt>3.3</tt>. </li>
</ul>
<p>The format string was intended to be <code>%3.3f</code>, which means a formatted floating point number with a minimum of three characters of output and exactly three places after the decimal. </p>
<p>That would result in <tt>(10.000,10.000)</tt>. </p>
<p>Note that if you ask for three places after the decimal, then you’re going to get at least four characters of output anyway, so the first <code>3</code> in <code>%3.3f</code> is meaningless. It doesn’t cause any harm, but it doesn’t do anything either. If they wanted a fixed-width format, then they could have used <code>%7.3f</code>, which would space-pad the value on the left to ensure three characters before the decimal. </p>
