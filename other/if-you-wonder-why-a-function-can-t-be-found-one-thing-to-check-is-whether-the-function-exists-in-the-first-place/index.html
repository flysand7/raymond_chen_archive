<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you wonder why a function can't be found, one thing to check is whether the function exists in the first place</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One of my colleagues was frustrated trying to get some code to build.
“Is there something strange about linking variadic functions?
Because I keep getting an unresolved external error for the function,
but if I move the function definition to the declaration point,
then everything works fine.”
</p>
<pre>
// blahblah.h
... other declarations ...
void LogWidget(Widget* widget, const char* format, ...);
...
// widgetstuff.cpp
...
#include "blahblah.h"
...
// some code that calls LogWidget
void foo(Widget* widget)
{
 LogWidget(widget, "starting foo");
 ...
}
// and then near the end of the file
void LogWidget(Widget* widget, const char* format, ...)
{
    ... implementation ...
}
...
</pre>
<p>
“With the above code, the linker complains that
<code>Log­Widget</code> cannot be found.
But if I move the implementation of
<code>Log­Widget</code> to the top of the file,
then everything builds fine.”
</p>
<pre>
// widgetstuff.cpp
...
#include "blahblah.h"
...
// move the code up here
void LogWidget(Widget* widget, const char* format, ...)
{
    ... implementation ...
}
// some code that calls LogWidget
void foo(Widget* widget)
{
 LogWidget(widget, "starting foo");
 ...
}
...
</pre>

<p>“I tried putting an explicit calling convention in the
declaration,
I tried using <code>extern "C"</code>,
nothing seems to help.”
</p>
<p>
We looked at the resulting object file and observed that
in the case where the error occurred,
there was an external reference to
<code>Log­Widget</code> but no definition.
I asked,
“Is the definition of the function
<code>#ifdef</code>‘d out by mistake?
You can use
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/10/8370479.aspx">
this technique</a>
to find out.”
</p>
<p>
That was indeed the problem.
The definition of the function was inside some sort of
<code>#ifdef</code> that prevented it from being compiled.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, the reason a function cannot be found is that it doesn’t
exist in the first place.</p>
