<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The craft of UI design: flow|state</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> You can tell right away that <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/"> Jan Miksovsky’s flow|state</a> is about user interface design. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Jan when he was at Microsoft. Whereas I focus on the mechanics of making a user interface happen, Jan looks at the bigger problems of design and interface architecture. For example, in this entry he <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/2005/10/ui_as_a_pesky_w.html"> considers the issue of asking the user unnecessary questions</a> and highlights some ways you can avoid hassling the user with a barrage of questions while still giving the user the ability to answer the question if they choose to. Good stuff.</p>
