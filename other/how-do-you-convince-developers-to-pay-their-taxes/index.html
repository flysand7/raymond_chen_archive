<p>The <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tabletpc/"> Tablet PC team</a> have a tough task ahead of them at this year’s PDC: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tabletpc/archive/2005/08/18/409450.aspx"> They have to get people to care about power management</a>.</p>
<p> The reason why this is tough is that power management is rarely a deal-maker. If a user is evaluating, say, personal finance software, how much weight are they going to place on which program consumes less battery power? That’s probably a third- or fourth-level tiebreaker. No amount of power management is going to overcome the fact that your program’s interface is harder to use than your competitor’s. Nobody ever said, “Oh, yeah, I switched my word processor from X to Y because X was chewing too much battery power.” When a battery doesn’t last very long, users tend to blame the battery, not the software that is draining it. </p>
<p> Power management falls into a category some development teams call “taxes”. It’s something you do, not because it actually benefits you specifically, but because it benefits the software landscape as a whole. Other taxes include making sure your program plays friendly with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/30/434209.aspx"> roaming user profiles</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/accessibility/fastuserswitching.mspx"> Fast User Switching</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/27/54710.aspx"> Hierarchical Storage Management</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/learnmore/northrup_multimon.mspx"> multiple monitors</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/getstarted/remoteintro.mspx"> Remote Desktop</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/isv/technology/64bitwindows/x64faq/default.aspx"> 64-bit Windows</a>. </p>
<p> Of course, not all development teams in the world are so diligent as to pay all their “taxes”. I suspect most cheat on their taxes, and some of them just don’t pay any at all. </p>
<p> So here’s my question to you: How do you convince developers to pay their “taxes”? (Should developers have to pay taxes at all?) </p>
