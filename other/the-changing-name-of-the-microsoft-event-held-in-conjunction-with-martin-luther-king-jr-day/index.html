<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The changing name of the Microsoft event held in conjunction with Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day"> Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</a>, a <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr1933rs/html/BILLS-103hr1933rs.htm"> federal holiday in the United States</a> honoring the civil rights leader and formally serving as a day to <a href="http://216.92.59.93/toa/codes/usc/titles/TITLE36/36USC169j.html"> reflect on the principles of racial equality and nonviolent social change</a> and more generally to <a href="http://mlkday.gov/"> honor Dr. King’s legacy through service</a>.</p>
<p> At Microsoft, the day has been recognized with an event whose name is, um, well, the name keeps changing. Here are the names from recent years: </p>
<ul>
<li>2006: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event </li>
<li>2007: Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration </li>
<li>2008: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event </li>
<li>2009: MLK Day Event </li>
<li>2010: Celebration to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. </li>
<li>2011: Martin Luther King Day of Celebration </li>
<li>2012: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration </li>
<li>2013: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration Event </li>
</ul>
<p> I like to think this is done intentionally just to keep people on their toes. </p>
<p> Ironically, although the event “celebrates diversity and inclusion,” the email announcing the event inadvertently excludes people with visual impairments because it consists of a giant JPG with no ALT text. </p>
<p> (No dream report from me today. That would be disrespectful to <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm"> the man himself</a>.) </p>
