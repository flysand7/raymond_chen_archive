<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The cult of PowerPoint</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Recent articles on <a href="http://www.slashnot.com/article.php3?story_id=338">how PowerPoint contributed to failure at NASA</a> reminded me that this is hardly a new discovery. The Department of Defense long ago discovered that <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-11-502314.html">PowerPoint is a great way to hide the fact that you don’t know what you’re talking about</a>.
I remember reading an article (which I of course can’t find now) of a “cult of PowerPoint”. Apparently some organizations take the built-in PowerPoint template as gospel. Every presentation <b>must</b> follow the structure established by the PowerPoint template. The first slide is always a title; the second is always a statement of a problem; the third slide is always summary of previous work, etc.
Um, people, it’s just a template.</p>
<p>And before the Linux folks get all so gloaty: “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18516-2001Oct18.html">Ravens Coach Brian Billick faults last week’s [October 2001] defensive breakdown on team’s switch to Linux operating system</a>.”</p>
