<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the mouse cursor jump a few pixels if you right-click on the Start button?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I noted that <a href="/other/why-does-the-mouse-cursor-jump-a-few-pixels-if-you-click-on-the-very-bottom-row-of-pixels-on-the-taskbar"> mouse cursor jumps a few pixels if you click on the very bottom row of pixels on the taskbar</a>. I noted that this is done to make it possible to click on the very bottom row of pixels, even though they are technically a border, in order to operate on the button immediately above them. Otherwise, the button-down code sees that the mouse is outside the button and cancels the button operation (click or drag).</p>
<p>If you right-click on the Start button, the mouse cursor jumps a few pixels up and to the right. Is this done to solve the same problem?</p>
<p>No, the problem doesn’t apply here because the right mouse button does not have the same cancellation behavior as the left mouse button. There’s a different reason for moving the mouse cursor.</p>
<p>The mouse cursor moves up and to the right so that it is positioned over the last menu item. That way, you can right-click followed by left-click to activate the bottom menu item.</p>
<p>This means that the bottom item on the Start button’s context menu has a special status: It’s the one you can activate quickly by performing a right-click left-click.</p>
