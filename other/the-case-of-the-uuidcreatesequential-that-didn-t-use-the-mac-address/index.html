<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the <code>Uuid­Create­Sequential</code> that didn’t use the MAC address</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that the <code>Uuid­Create­Sequential</code> function was generating UUIDs that did not place the network card’s MAC address in the final bytes of the UUID.</p>
<p>Sequentially-generated UUIDs are so-called Version 1 UUIDs: A combination of a timestamp and a MAC address. The timestamp is incremented to produce sequential UUIDs.</p>
<p>So why wasn’t the MAC address being used in the UUID? Instead, the high bit of the first byte of the MAC address was set, indicating that this was a pseudo-random MAC address rather than a real one. (In real MAC addresses, the first bit is zero, indicating a unicast destination.)</p>
<p>It took a lot of investigation, but the team finally got to the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Their systems had a virtual network card, and the driver for the virtual network card generated a MAC address where the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) was <code>FFFFFF</code>.</p>
<p>Uh, oh.</p>
<p>Remember I said that in real MAC addresses, the first bit is zero, indicating a unicast destination. But their MAC address had the first bit (indeed the first 24 bits) all set!</p>
<p>When the system gets the MAC address for the purpose of creating sequential UUIDs, it ignores network adapters who report a OUI of <code>FFFFFF</code>, on the assumption that they are fake network adapters and therefore do not carry a unique MAC address.</p>
<p>And if <i>all</i> of the network adapters are fake, then the UUID generation algorithm falls back to the case where there is no network adapter at all and generates a pseudo-random one. And sets the bit that says “This is a fake MAC address.”</p>
<p>When told that their virtual network card driver was setting the OUI to <code>FFFFFF</code>, they answered, “Is that a problem? Should we be using something else?”</p>
<p>It’s actually a good thing that they accidentally chose a blatantly invalid OUI for their fake MAC address, because it makes things as clear as possible (within the expressive range of 48-bit MAC addresses) that the MAC address is fake and should not be relied upon for global uniqueness. The <code>Uuid­Create­Sequential</code> function is correct to ignore that artificial MAC address and fall back on a pseudo-randomly-generated one.</p>
<p>The problem was not in the <code>Uuid­Create­Sequential</code> function, nor was it in their virtual network card. It was in their expectations! If you have a fake network card, then its MAC cannot be used to generate sequential GUIDs.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection-automatically"> kdnet</a> feature also sets up a virtual network card with a vendor ID of all F’s. So if you enabled kdnet, and you don’t have a real network card, then you may encounter this problem, too.</p>
