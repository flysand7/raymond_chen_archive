<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway: Disclosure of information you already had access to</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A number of security vulnerability reports came in of the form</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>If I call the <code>XYZ</code> function and pass it a crafted buffer, the function parses the buffer incorrectly and reads beyond the end of the buffer. It then returns that invalidly-read data back to the caller. This is an information disclosure vulnerability in the <code>XYZ</code> function.</p></blockquote>
<p>The important missing detail here is that the <code>XYZ</code> function runs in the same process as the caller.</p>
<p>This means that the invalidly-read data came from the same process. The process is gaining access to information disclosed from itself.</p>
<p>This is not particularly interesting by itself. The process already had access to the disclosed data by virtue of the fact that the <code>XYZ</code> function running inside the process was able to read it. The information did not cross a security boundary, so there is no vulnerability. If your goal was to access that data, you didn’t need the <code>XYZ</code> function to do it for you. You could have just read it yourself.</p>
<p>This is just a case of garbage-in garbage-out. If you pass garbage to a function, don’t be surprised if you receive garbage in return. Of course, if this garbage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed"> crosses a security boundary</a>, then there is a problem. But if the garbage came from the same security realm, there’s nothing interesting going on. You’re just disclosing information that the caller already had access to.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: If the garbage came from an untrusted source, then the boundary crossing was performed by the person who took untrusted data and used it without validation.</p>
<p><b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>: There are some functions which can be used with untrusted data, but in general, it is the caller’s responsibility to pass valid data. If the function takes a double-null-terminated string, say, and you pass something that isn’t a double-null-terminated string, well, that’s on you if this results in walking off the end of the buffer and returning unrelated memory.</p>
