<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: snap</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today’s Microspeak is the word <i>snap</i>, which means “To take a snapshot of the source code,” usually for the purpose of producing a build. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>The build lab snaps at 6pm, so make sure your changes are in by then. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is saying that the build lab will take whatever has been checked in as of 6pm and use that to generate a build. If you commit your changes at 6:01pm, they won’t be in the build. </p>
<p>The term <i>snap</i> may be applied to a process that goes beyond a single build: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>The release team is going to snap at 6pm for the beta. </p></blockquote>
<p>This means that the release team has decided to create a release branch based on what was checked in at 6pm. If you want your changes to be in the beta, they need to be checked in before 6pm. </p>
<p>Nobody ever says <i>snapshot</i>. It’s just <i>snap</i>. </p>
