<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Blog going on autopilot for a while</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I will be out of town for a few weeks, so I have set my blog on autopilot. There will still be an article every weekday at 7am Pacific time (assuming the autopilot machine doesn’t suffer a power outage or something), but I won’t be around (much) to respond to comments.</p>
