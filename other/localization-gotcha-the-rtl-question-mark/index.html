<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Localization gotcha: The RTL question mark</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Displaying a question mark in RTL is not as easy as it sounds, because different languages use different question marks. </p>
<p>Languages which use Arabic or Arabic-style script flip the question mark, resulting in ؟. On the other hand, Hebrew does not flip the question mark; they use the LTR-style ?. </p>
<p>This is normally handled as part of string localization, but you have to be careful if you have a question mark embedded into a bitmap, such as a Help icon or button. You have to make the bitmap available to localization so that the Arabic localizers can flip the question mark, whereas the Hebrew localizers leave it alone. </p>
