<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Wireless AC is, unfortunately, not what it sounds like</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->


<p> I saw a laptop advertised as supporting “Wireless AC”. </p>
<p>I thought to myself, “Sweet, no more power cables!” </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was not referring to wireless alternating current. It was referring to the 802.11ac wireless networking standard. </p>
<p>Because of course the standard that comes after 802.11n should be called 802.11ac. </p>
<p>The first few 802.11 wireless networking standard revisions have been named 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. </p>
<p>A, B, G, N, AC. </p>
<p>Apparently alphabetical order is hard. </p>
