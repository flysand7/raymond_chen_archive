<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Precision questioning: The cynical description</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_questioning">Precision questioning</a> is a technique used by some senior executives at Microsoft. Although precision questioning positions itself as a toolkit for critical thinking and problem solving, its use in practice doesn’t always line up with its ostensible description. As a senior manager explained it to me, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>The way precision questioning works is that executive X is going to ask you a question, and then after you answer it, you’ll be asked a follow-up question, and so on until you finally say “I don’t know.” You want to last as many rounds as possible before finally reaching the point where they asked a question you cannot answer. </p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if that’s what precision questioning is really about, but that’s how some practitioners use it. </p>
