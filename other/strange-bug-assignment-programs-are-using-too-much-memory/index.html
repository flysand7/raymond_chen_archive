<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Strange bug assignment: Programs are using too much memory</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> My office is in the same hallway as the programmer and program manager responsible for the Processes tab in Task Manager. (Of course, they are responsible for a bunch of other stuff too; it’s not like 100% of their days are dedicated to Task Manager!) I happened to be passing by just as this particular bug popped up on their radar. It went something like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> Problem: Task Manager reporting programs are using too much memory </p>
<p> Steps to reproduce:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Start up the system and run some programs. </li>
<li>Run Task Manager. </li>
<li>Go to the Process tab. </li>
<li>Look at the Memory Usage column. </li>
</ul>
<p> Result: The numbers are too big! </p>
<p> Expected result: Less memory usage. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Apparently, it’s Task Manager’s fault that other programs are using lots of memory. Maybe we should just take the values and divide them by two, just to make things look better. </p>
