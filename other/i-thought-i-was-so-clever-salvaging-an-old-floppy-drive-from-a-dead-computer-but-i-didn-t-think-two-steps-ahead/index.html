<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I thought I was so clever, salvaging an old floppy drive from a dead computer, but I didn't think *two* steps ahead…</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/11/407130.aspx"> one of the oldest computers at Microsoft still doing useful work</a> finally died, I had the presence of mind to salvage the 5¼″ floppy drive from the machine, so that I could (someday) extract the data off all the old 5¼″ floppy discs I have packed away in boxes meaning to convert someday. (Mind you, the data capacity of a giant box of 5&amp;frac14″ floppy disks is approximately equal to half of a CD.)
 Oh, and by the way, if you know what a floppy drive is, then <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/231273/what-are-the-windows-a-and-b-drives-used-for"> this question on superuser.com</a> will make you feel old.
 I thought I was so clever, salvaging an old floppy drive from a dead computer so I could use it to rescue data from obsolescence, but that was only thinking one step ahead. I failed to think <i>two</i> steps ahead: Nobody makes motherboards with 5¼″ floppy drive connectors!</p>
