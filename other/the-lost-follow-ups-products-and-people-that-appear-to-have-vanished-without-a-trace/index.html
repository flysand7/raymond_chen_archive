<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The lost follow-ups: Products and people that appear to have vanished without a trace</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> There’ll be the big announcement promising a revolution in the computer industry, lots of press coverage, and then… nothing. What ever happened to these companies and products? Does anybody know? </p>
<ul>
<li>Infinium’s (aptly-named)     <a href="http://www.hardocp.com/article.html?art=NTEy">     Phantom gaming console</a>.     (Apparently it is now     <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6144631.html">     on hold</a>. Can you put something that     never existed “on hold”?)     (Oh wait,     <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/15/gasp-phantom-console-fails-to-materialize/">     maybe it’s gone</a>. I can’t tell.) </li>
<li>ZeoSync’s     <a href="http://backseatdriver.com/clients/ZeoSync/docs/home.htm">     Relational Differentiation Encoding™</a>,     promising 100:1 lossless compression. </li>
<li>SpecOps’s     <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2004/0803linuxstart.html">     David OS</a>,     which was only     <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040207221434/www.specopslabs.com/david_development.htm">     six months from completion</a>     with commercial availability by the end of 2004. </li>
<li>The Consumer Broadcast Network, which     <a href="http://investmentsmagazine.com/ManageArticle.asp?C=120&amp;A=1530">     announced its intention to place a multi-billion dollar bid for AOL</a>.     “This is not a joke,” insists Francisco Schipperheijn.     According to     <a href="http://sec.edgar-online.com/2005/04/15/0001213900-05-000341/Section11.asp">     this SEC filing</a>,     “Consumer Broadcast Network is a collection of internet domains that     are not online.” </li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ryjones.org/">Ry Jones</a>     nominates     <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2004/10/12/cherryos/">     CherryOS</a> for inclusion on this list.     “<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,65368,00.html">We’re     for real</a>,” they maintain.     Oh wait,     <!-- old link http://www.kryeziu.com/blog_details.aspx?id=1&amp;det=1 --> <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/CherryOS_Drama_Ends_Product_Retired/1115656418">     they gave up</a>.     [10:30am – Link updated. Apparently he took down his original announcement     so now I have to link to a second-hand report.] </li>
</ul>
