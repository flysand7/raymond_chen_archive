<p>The term <i>ingestion</i> refers to the process of taking code from one project and incorporating it into another project.</p>

<p>Here is a public citation:</p>

<p>Ingestion takes many forms. It could be a source code drop. It could be a binary drop of a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20171114-00/?p=97396"> foreign checked-in binary</a>. It could be upgrading the toolchain (ingesting a new compiler). It could be changing the NuGet references. It could be upgrading the Windows SDK. For hosted services or embedded systems, it could be upgrading the operating system.</p>
<p>The term <i>ingestion</i> is used from the point of view of the project receiving the new code. The receiving project <i>ingests</i> the donor project. On occasion, a donor project may refer to the act of delivering code to a recipient as <i>reverse ingestion</i>, but I have never heard it referred to as <i>egestion</i>, thank goodness.</p>
