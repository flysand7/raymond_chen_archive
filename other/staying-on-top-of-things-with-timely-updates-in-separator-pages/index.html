<p> For a month prior to the transition this past spring, the separator pages generated by the shared company printers contained a handy reminder that Daylight Saving Time began early this year.
 The reminder remained on the separator pages as late as the summer solstice.</p>
<p> Maybe the people who design the separator pages didn’t have anything more interesting to say, so they let the old message ride. </p>
