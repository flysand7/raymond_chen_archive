<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The latest technologies in plaintext editing: NotepadConf</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On <strike>November 13, 2014</strike> November 14, 2014, Saint Paul, Minnesota will be the home to <a href="http://notepadconf.com/">NotepadConf</a>, which bills itself as “the premier technology conference for Notepad.exe users and text enthusiasts.”
 I’m still not sure <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/02/9915989.aspx"> whom Microsoft will send to the conference</a>, but maybe that person could give a talk on how you can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/28/10528970.aspx"> use Notepad to take down the entire Internet</a>.</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: The conference has been rescheduled to Friday the 14th. </p>
