<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">See you in Building 109, Conference Room A</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We saw some time ago that if somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/01/8346907.aspx"> invites you to a meeting in Building 7</a>, they are inviting you off campus to take a break from work.
 If somebody invites you to a meeting in <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;where1=Microsoft+Building+109,+WA&amp;encType=1"> Building 109</a>, Conference Room A, they are inviting you to join them at the <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;where1=3040+148th+Ave+NE,+Redmond,+WA&amp;encType=1"> Azteca Mexican restaurant next door</a>.
 <b>Update</b>: One of the members of the “Building 109 Conference Room A” mailing list informed me that Building 109 Conference Room A is specifically the bar at the Azteca restaurant.</p>
<p> <b>Update 2</b>: Building 109 Conference Room A has its own mailing list! </p>
