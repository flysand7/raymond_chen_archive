<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the difference between a directory and a folder?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Windows 95 introduced Windows Explorer and along with it the term <i>folder</i>. What is the relationship between folders and directories?
 Some people believe that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/04/9394113.aspx#9409026"> Windows 95 renamed directories to folders</a>, but it’s actually more than that.
 Windows Explorer lets you view <i>folders</i>, which are containers in the <i>shell namespace</i>. <i>Directories</i> are one type of folder, namely, folders which correspond to file system locations. There are other types of folders, such as <i>Control Panel</i> or <i>Network Neighborhood</i> or <i>Printers</i>. These other types of folders represent objects in the shell namespace which do not correspond to files. In common usage, the term <i>virtual folder</i> has been applied to refer to folders which are not directories. In other words, we have this Euler diagram:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFF0C0" style="border: solid black .75pt">     Folders

</td>
<td valign="center"> Virtual folders = Folders − Directories </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> In general, code which manipulates the shell namespace should operate on folders and items, not directories and files, so as not to tie themselves to a particular storage medium. For example, code which limits itself to files won’t be able to navigate into a Zip file, since the contents of a Zip file are exposed in the form of a virtual folder.</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: The Web server “helpfully” closed some tags prematurely. Apparently it doesn’t want you to nest tables. Replaced nested table with DIV. </p>
