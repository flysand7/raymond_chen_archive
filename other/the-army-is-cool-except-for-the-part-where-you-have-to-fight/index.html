<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The army is cool, except for the part where you have to fight</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s some to-do over  <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2097279/">a soldier who volunteered  to serve in the army who has since changed his mind and is applying for  conscientous objector status</a>.
  I noticed this trend over two years ago, when  <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPentagon.asp?Page=/Pentagon/archive/200110/PEN20011017a.html">  people who had enlisted in the armed forces underwent a change of  heart after the World Trade Center attacks</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  Many of the enlisted personnel who are now seeking honorable  discharges argue they didn’t sign up to defend America; they just  wanted to learn a trade or earn money for college.  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Sort of like the  <a href="http://www.montypython.net/scripts/armyprot.php">  Monty Python sketch</a>.
  “Watkins why did you join the army?”<br/>  “For the water-skiing and for the travel, sir. And not for the  killing, sir. I asked them to put it on my form, sir – no killing.”
  (I should point out that this particular situation appears to be different,  however, since he did serve the first time he was called.)</p>
