<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Holy cow, those TechReady attendees really love their tchotchkes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was at the <i>Ask the Experts</i> event last night at TechReady11, and if I didn’t know better, I would have thought the purpose of <i>Ask the Experts</i> was for attendees to wander the room collecting the coolest swag they could get their hands on as quickly as possible. My table was equipped with about two dozen Windows 7 frisbees, and the moment they came out of the box, they disappeared into the hands of passers-by, most of whom didn’t even bother reading the sign on the table much less make eye contact with me.
 The table next to mine started with a mountain of mugs, but it wasn’t long before it was reduced to a molehill.
 To try to convince people at least to make eye contact with me, I hid the remaining frisbees under the table, handing them only to people who actually stopped to ask a question, or at least tell an interesting story.
 After the frisbees were gone, the swag fairies dropped a few dozen battery-powered light stick thingies. They didn’t disappear as quickly, perhaps because the initial surge of swag-hunters had subsided.</p>
<p> I was kind of surprised at how aggressively people went after the swag. This is, after all, a Microsoft internal event. You’d think these people would be jaded by now, having been surrounded by Microsoft-branded doodads for years. </p>
