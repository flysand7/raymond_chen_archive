<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sure, you can implement your own cryptographic service provider for a standard algorithm, but why would you?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to write their own custom implementation of an existing standard encryption algorithm. The customer liaison noted that this custom implementation would presumably produce results identical to the built-in implementation because it is, after all, a standard. But if that’s the case, there doesn’t seem to be much point to the undertaking. </p>
<p>There was some speculation as to why the customer wanted to reimplement a standard algorithm. Maybe they thought they could do a better job by taking advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set">special-purpose instructions in the CPU</a> for encryption and decryption? But a member of the security team confirmed that the built-in providers already take advantage of those instructions if available. “Unless your customer wants to use a mode that the built-in providers don’t support, there is no technical reason for them to write their own implementation.” </p>
<p>The customer liaison reported that the customer was trying to close a deal with a client. The client wants to be able to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554259%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx">configure Exchange to use a customized encryption algorithm</a>. “They might not end up creating such a customized encryption algorithm, but they want to be sure that it’s possible, so they need a proof-of-concept demonstration.” The customer found the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30688">Cryptographic Provider Development Kit</a> and was working through the sample provider. </p>
<p>One person contributed to the discussion with a story from personal experience: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>I worked at a company where custom cryptography was a government requirement. Don’t do it. Developing and supporting custom cryptography is a multi-year undertaking. <a href="http://www.cryptopro.ru/products/csp">It is technically possible</a>, but I don’t think your customer is willing to invest so much. You need to position the solution differently. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaron_margosis/">Aaron Margosis</a> agreed. “Sometimes, people take technical requirements too literally when they should be looking at the bigger-picture business requirement, which can often be met with existing technologies.” </p>
