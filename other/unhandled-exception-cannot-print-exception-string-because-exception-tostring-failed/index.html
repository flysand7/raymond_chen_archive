<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Unhandled Exception: Cannot print exception string because Exception.ToString() failed.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I ran an internal tool, and it communicated with a back-end service, and then displayed the error </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Unhandled Exception: Cannot print exception string because Exception.ToString() failed. </p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t figure out what that even means. </p>
<p>I waited a little while, then tried again, </p>
<p>It worked the second time. </p>
<p>Didn’t even need to turn it off and back on again. </p>
