<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to tell the poseurs from the actual Windows developers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Poseurs will call Windows versions by their programmatic version numbers. For example, they will call Windows Vista “NT6” and Windows 7 “NT6.1”. Trust me, nobody on the Windows team calls the products by their programmatic version numbers. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/06/10220920.aspx#10221276"> Whenever anybody says “NT6”</a> I have to go to Wikipedia and look up what they’re actually talking about. If I even care to bother, and usually I don’t.</p>
<p> Actually, since I work in the client division, I also have to go look up what Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 corespond to. People will ask question about client-related issues on server, and we have to go back and match it up. </p>
<p> It’s like TV insider poseurs who refer to episodes as “Season 3 Episode 9” instead of by their title or just a plot description. If you say to somebody who works on a TV show, “In season 3 episode 9, Anna <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail3.html"> clearly states</a> that she is an only child, yet in season 5 episode 12, she talks about her older sister,” they will have no clue what episode you’re talking about. </p>
<p> They will also tell you to <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x930vt_william-shatner-snl-skit-get-a-life_fun"> get a life</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: The phrase “clearly states” is a pretty good tip-off that you’re dealing with somebody who needs to get out of their parents’ basement more. </p>
