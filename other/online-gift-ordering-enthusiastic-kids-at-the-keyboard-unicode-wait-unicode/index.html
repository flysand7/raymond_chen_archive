<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Online gift ordering + enthusiastic kids at the keyboard + Unicode, wait… Unicode?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was completing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000062SP5/?tag=tholneth-20"> an online gift order</a> for my young nephew’s birthday, and I was in the middle of typing <i>Happy birthday</i> into the gift card message when an enthusiastic child reached for the keyboard and held down the “a” key as I typed the final “a” in “birthday”.
 I wanted to capture the spontaneous enthusiasm in the gift tag, but I had no idea what font or format rectangle was going to be used, so I couldn’t be sure where to put hyphens so that they will ensure line breaks at visually-pleasing locations. And if I didn’t insert hyphens at all, then the line would just run off the end of the gift tag and end up truncated.
 Unicode to the rescue!
 First, I fired up <code>charmap</code> and went to character <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ad/index.htm"> U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN</a>. I double-clicked the character in the grid, thereby copying it invisibly to the <i>Characters to copy</i> box. I then clicked the <i>Copy</i> button to copy the invisible soft hyphen to the clipboard. Then I switched back to my Web browser and pasted the soft hyphen into the long string of a’s every six or so characters, to provide a hyphenation point.
 Success!</p>
<blockquote class="m" style="width: 30%"><p> Happy birthd­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­aaaaaa­y! </p></blockquote>
<p> When the gift reached its destination, my brother said, “Nice job on the hyphens. How did you know where to put them?”
 I then let him in on the secret. And now I’m sharing it with you.</p>
<p> Anybody know whether Amazon supports the creative use of Unicode to create elaborate smiley faces? </p>
