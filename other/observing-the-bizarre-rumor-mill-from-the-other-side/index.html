<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Observing the bizarre rumor mill from the other side</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I remember being <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nonplus">nonplussed</a> upon reading news reports that some Windows feature or other was a sure thing, despite a lack of actual, y’know, official confirmation. The one that sticks with me is the claim that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110709064124/http://www.techguruhere.com/microsoft-planning-128-bit-version-of-windows-8/">there would be a 128-bit version of Windows 8</a>. The source for this information was a remark in somebody’s LinkedIn profile, which I’m sure is completely reliable, because nobody lies in their LinkedIn profile. </p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100306182617/http://blog.eightforums.com/windows-8-news/windows-8-x128-the-next-pc-revolution-has-is-begun">One group</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100305073830/http://blog.eightforums.com/windows-8-news/exclusive-interview-with-robert-morgan-about-128-bit">claims to have lined up an exclusive interview with the elusive Robert Morgan</a>, although the interview never appears to have taken place. </p>
<p>Not only was the profile fake, it was fakified <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091231091622/http://msftkitchen.com/2009/11/128-bit-kernel-support-in-windows-8-and-windows-9-a-big-fat-lie.html">by the people who “discovered” it</a>. </p>
<p>Another example is the article <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100325110501/http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-windows-8-643699">8 things you need to know about Windows 8</a>, which says “But there are some things we do know.” And then a few paragraphs later, they admit that everything they know is from job ads and LinkedIn profiles, so y’know, totally reliable. </p>
<p>And then there’s <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/is-silverlight-for-iphone-finally-on-its-way/6350">this article</a>, which is 100% speculation. “I’m thinking if such an announcement happens, it’ll be Silverlight for the iPhone.” The basis for this claim is a tweet from somebody guessing that Steve Ballmer will announce Silverlight for iPhone at the WWDC Keynote, which is double-speculation, since Ballmer’s purported appearance was itself just wild speculation (that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/27/debunk-steve-ballmer-not-speaking-at-wwdc/">turned out to be false</a>). After considering the feasibility of such an announcement the article ends, “What do you think? Could the rumors be true?” </p>
<p>I have to admit, I really admire that. The article makes up a rumor, and then asks, “Is it true?” Hey, here’s an idea: “No it isn’t, because you just made it up.” </p>
<p>Today is P. T. Barnum’s birthday. Or at least the day people <i>claim</i> to be his birthday. </p>
