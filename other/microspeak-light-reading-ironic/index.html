<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Light reading (ironic)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s not quite Microspeak, but it is a sort of Microjoke: Referring to a document as “light reading”.</p>
<p>In common parlance, “light reading” is something that is easy to read without requiring significant mental effort: A magazine that covers celebrity comings and goings, a romantic comedy novel, a travel story. If you choose to read them, they are typically enjoyable content that doesn’t require close reading and which you can put down at a moment’s notice. If you encounter a section that you find boring, you can just skip over it without serious repercussions.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, the term “light reading” is almost never used to mean that. Rather, it is used ironically to refer to a document that is one or more of the following: Lengthy, complex, mandatory.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>All of the documents that were covered at the directors review are available on this site. Enjoy the light reading!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Some light reading for the Tuesday meeting: (lengthy email message follows)</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a citation from outside Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Just in case you wanted a little <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/unboxing-and-testing-the-apple-tv/"> light reading</a>, you can access the Apple TV’s software license agreement through the Settings menu.</p></blockquote>
