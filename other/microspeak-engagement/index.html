<p>Meetings are so passé. You no longer have a meeting with a customer; you have an <i>engagement</i>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I have a customer engagement tomorrow and they have a question surrounding Feature X. </p></blockquote>
<p> Note that this use of the phrase <i>customer engagement</i> is different from the process known as customer engagement. The process is an ongoing interaction, a long-term activity to build customer loyalty.</p>
<p> The author of the above sentence is not using it in the process sense (because you don’t have “a” customer engagement; rather, a meeting is one component of the overall process of customer engagement). Nope, the author is just trying to sound cool. </p>
