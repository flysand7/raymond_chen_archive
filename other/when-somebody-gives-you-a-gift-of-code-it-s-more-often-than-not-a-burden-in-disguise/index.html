<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#491850"> Why doesn’t Microsoft bundle third-party programs?</a>
 Yes, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961107020111/http://www.inso.com/frames/consprod.htm#qvp"> it has been done</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961105231122/www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html"> in the past</a>, but the results were hardly a slam dunk success.
 Who ports the software to 64-bit Windows? (Answer: Me, personally. I spent a good chunk of the year 2000 porting millions of lines of code to 64-bit Windows. Just for fun, I did a <code>wc -l</code> on a couple of the “gifts” that I ported. Over 100,000 lines of code in one of them, and over 50,000 in another.)
 Who fixes the security holes in the software? (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923810">Answer</a>: Me and people I work with.)
 Who has to pay all the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/22/454487.aspx"> software taxes</a> that the original software vendor failed to address? (Answer: Me and people I work with.)
 Who has to update the program to keep up with new Windows design guidelines? (Answer: Me and people I work with.)
 Who has to make the program localizable? (Answer: Microsoft.)
 Who has to translate the software into 20+ languages? (Answer: Microsoft.)
 Who gets sued if there is a patent violation in the software? (Answer: <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1014_3-5445868.html"> Microsoft</a>.)
 Will people realize that the bundled tools are included merely as a courtesy and that applications should not rely on their continued presence? (Answer: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/11/7065021.aspx"> No</a>.)
 I know this from personal experience. When somebody gives you a gift of code, it’s more often than not a burden in disguise.
 And that’s not counting the legal and public relations challenges some commenters in the linked article have raised. I mean, heck, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/25/1529570.aspx"> Windows Vista simply included some photographs from the user community</a> and look at all the anger that generated, both in the comments and <a href="http://www.stockphototalk.com/phototalk/2007/02/more_on_flickr_.html"> elsewhere</a>. And those were just photos!</p>
<p> (Some people might notice that this is the flip side of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/12/5409832.aspx"> free code samples</a>.) </p>
