<p>Like everybody else, I was checking out <a href="http://www.msn.com/">the new MSN home page</a> and I clicked over to <a href="http://new.msn.com/homepage/">the tour</a>. And right there as their top headline in the sample web page, it says, “Wierd items of the future”.
Ahem. It’s spelled w-e-i-r-d.
And on all of the MSN properties, like <a href="http://local.msn.com/">local city guides</a>, you can see MSN’s new motto: “More Useful Everyday”.
Um, another spelling error. That should read “More Useful Every Day”. When used as a single word, “everyday” is an adjective, not an adverb. Like “An everyday event”.</p>
<p>I’ll stick with <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo</a>, thanks the same. At least they know how to spell.</p>
