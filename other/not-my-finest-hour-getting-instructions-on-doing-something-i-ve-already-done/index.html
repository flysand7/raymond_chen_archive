<p>Last year, I sent some email to the people who run our team’s check-in validation tool asking how I could add a new rule to the validation tests. One of the members wrote back, “You do it just like this guy,” and sent me a reference to another check-in that added a validation rule.</p>
<p> That other check-in was made by me. </p>
<p> But wait, it gets better. </p>
<p> That other check-in? It added the very rule I was thinking about adding. </p>
