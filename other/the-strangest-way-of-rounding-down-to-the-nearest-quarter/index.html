<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The strangest way of rounding down to the nearest quarter</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
In a previous life, I wrote database software.
A customer complained that one of their reports was taking an
unacceptably long amount of time to generate, and I was asked
to take a look at it even though it wasn’t my account.
</p>
<p>
The report was a vacation-days report, listing the number of
vacation days taken and available for each employee.  Vacation
days accrued at a fixed rate but were granted only in
quarter-day increments. For example, if you earned 15 vacation
days per year and the year was 32% complete, then you had
accrued 32% × 15 = 4.8 vacation days, of which 4.75 were
available to use.
</p>
<p>
The existing code to round the number of accrued days down to
the nearest quarter-day went something like this:
</p>
<pre>
* assume that at this point, ACCRUED is the number
* of accrued days.
PRIVATE S,F
* STR(ACCRUED,6,2) converts ACCRUED to a 6-character
* string: 3 integer digits, a decimal point, and two
* fractional digits.  Excess fractional digits are rounded.
STORE STR(ACCRUED,6,2) TO S
STORE RIGHT(S,2) TO F        &amp;&amp; extract digits after decimal
IF F &lt; "25"
 F = "00"                    &amp;&amp; 00 to 24 becomes 00
ELSE
 IF F &lt; "50"
  F = "25"                   &amp;&amp; 25 to 49 becomes 25
 ELSE
  IF F &lt; "75"
   F = "50"                  &amp;&amp; 50 to 74 becomes 50
  ELSE
   F = "75"                  &amp;&amp; 75 to 99 becomes 75
  ENDIF
 ENDIF
ENDIF
ROUNDED = VAL(LEFT(S,4) + F) &amp;&amp; reconstruct value and convert
</pre>
<p>
In other words, the code converted the number to a string,
extracted the digits after the decimal point, did string comparisons
to figure out which quartile the fraction resided in, then
created a new string with the replacement fraction and converted
that string back to a number.
And all this in an interpreted language.
</p>
<p>
This code fragment was repeated each time rounding-down was
needed because the language supported only 32 subroutines,
and this procedure wasn’t important enough to be worth kicking
out one of the other existing subroutines.
</p>
<p>
I replaced this seventeen-line monstrosity with the one-line
equivalent each time it occurred, and the report ran much faster.
</p>
<p>
(This is nowhere near the strangest way of implementing rounding.

There are far worse examples</a>.)

<p>
<strong>Exercise</strong>: What is the one-line equivalent?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exercise</strong>: What is the double-rounding bug in the original
code?</p>
