<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What U.S. college students miss from home</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I didn’t believe it until I saw it myself: My friend asked me to bring <a href="http://www.keysan.com/big/picyjrv0015.html">red and blue plastic cups</a> to Sweden because the U.S. students really miss them. It’s true. Here’s why. (This needed to be explained to me because this was a part of U.S. college life I missed out on.)
These cups are valuable because they are opaque. This allows you to walk down the street with a beer without anybody (anybody = police) being able to tell that you have a beer in your hand, which would otherwise be a violation of open-container laws or evidence of underage drinking. As a result, the plastic cups have been synonymous with college drinking. 
That’s why the U.S. students miss them so.</p>
<p>In other news: Stockholm basically closes at 4pm on Saturdays.</p>
