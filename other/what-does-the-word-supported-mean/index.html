<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the word “supported” mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Is the /3GB switch supported on Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition?</p>
<p> It depends on what you mean by “supported”. Unfortunately, the word has multiple meanings, and the intended meaning is not always obvious from context. </p>
<p> One definition of “supported” is “The software makes a good-faith attempt to implement the functionality.” For the purpose of this discussion, I will use the word “implemented” to describe this sense of the word “supported”. </p>
<p> Another definition of “supported” is “The functionality has been tested to a high enough degree of confidence that the product support team will help you if you have problems with it.” I don’t have a good word for this concept; I will use the word “blessed” for lack of a better term. </p>
<p> In the vast majority of cases, the product teams keep the two concepts in sync. If the test team won’t bless a feature,  its implementation will be pulled from the product. The /3GB switch is one of those odd cases where implementation does not match blessing. </p>
<p> Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition does implement the /3GB switch, but <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/exchange/guides/E2k3Perf_ScalGuide/e834e9c7-708c-43bf-b877-e14ae443ecbf.mspx"> its use is not blessed</a>. (It is blessed for Enterprise Edition and Datacenter Edition, however. See the linked article for more details.) </p>
