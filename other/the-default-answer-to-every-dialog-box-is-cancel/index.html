<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The default answer to every dialog box is "Cancel"</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         The problem with displaying UI is that people will take every opportunity to ignore         it. <a href="http://napps.nwfusion.com/compendium/archive/003362.html">This story         of how people deal with virus warning dialogs</a> (via <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dbrowning/">Don         Browning</a>) is a template for how users treat any unexpected dialog: They try to         get rid of it.      </p>
<p>         We see this time and time again. If you are trying to accomplish task A, and in the         process of doing it, an unexpected dialog box B appears, you aren’t going to stop         and read and consider B carefully. You’re going to try to find the quickest path to         getting rid of dialog B. For most people, this means minimizing it or clicking “Cancel”         or just plain ignoring it.      </p>
<p>         This manifests itself in many ways, but the basic idea is, “That dialog box is scary.         I’m afraid to answer the question because I might answer it incorrectly and lose all         my data. So I’ll try to find a way to get rid of it as quickly as possible.”      </p>
<p>         Here are some specific examples, taken from real customers:      </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>                 “How do I make this error message go away? It appears every time I start the computer.”              </p>
<p>                 “What does this error message say?”              </p>
<p>                 “It says, ‘Updates are ready to install.’ I’ve just been clicking the X to make it                 go away, but it’s really annoying.”              </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                 “Every time I start my computer, I get this message that says that updates are ready                 to install. What does it mean?”              </p>
<p>                 “It means that Microsoft has found a problem that may allow a computer virus to get                 into your machine, and it’s asking for your permission to fix the problem. You should                 click on it so the problem can be fixed.”              </p>
<p>                 “Oh, that’s what it is? I thought it was a virus, so I just kept clicking No.”              </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                 “When I start the computer I get this big dialog that talks about Automatic Updates.                 I’ve just been hitting Cancel. How do I make it stop popping up?”              </p>
<p>                 “Did you read what the dialog said?”              </p>
<p>                 “No. I just want it to go away.”              </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                 “Sometimes I get the message saying that my program has crashed and would I like to                 send an error report to Microsoft. Should I do it?”              </p>
<p>                 “Yes, we study these error reports so we can see how we can fix the problem that caused                 the crash.”              </p>
<p>                 “Oh, I’ve just been hitting Cancel because that’s what I always do when I see an error                 message.”              </p>
<p>                 “Did you read the error message?              </p>
<p>                 “Why should I? It’s just an error message.  All it’s going to say is ‘Operation could not be performed because blah blah blah blah blah.'”              </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>         When most people buy a car, they don’t expect to have to learn how an engine works         and how to change spark plugs. They buy a car so they can drive it to get from point         A to point B. If the car makes a funny noise, they will ignore it as long as possible.         Eventually, it may bother them to the point of taking it to a mechanic who will ask         incredulously, “How long has it been doing this?” And the answer will be something         like, “Oh, about a year.”      </p>
<p>         The same goes for computers. People don’t want to learn about gigabytes and baud and         security zones. They just want to send email to their friends and surf the web.      </p>
<p>         I myself have thrown out a recall notice because I thought it was junk mail. And computers         are so filled with pop-up messages that any new pop-up message is treated as just         another piece of junk mail to be thrown away.      </p>
<p>         Automobile manufacturers have learned to consolidate all their error messages into         one message called “Check engine”. People are conditioned to take the car in to a         mechanic when the “Check engine” light goes on, and let the mechanic figure out what         is wrong. Can we have a “Check engine” light for computers? Would it be feasible?      </p>
