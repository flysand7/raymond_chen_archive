<dt>What are you talking about?          </dt>
<dd>             Tweak UI is part of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp">Windows             XP PowerToys</a>. It was recently updated to version 2.10. </dd>
<dt>What OS is required?              </dt>
<dd>                 Windows XP Service Pack 1 (or higher) or Windows Server 2003 (all versions). Not supported:                 Windows XP RTM, Windows 2000, NT 4, Windows 95, 98, or Me. </dd>
<dt>Why didn’t you make                 a big announcement? I didn’t find out about it until somebody told me.                  </dt>
<dd>                     I don’t control the announcements page. I figured word would get out – and it did. </dd>
<dt>Why                     is the new Tweak UI so much smaller than the old one?                      </dt>
<dd>                         Leaner installer program. </dd>
<dt>Are you always this terse?                          </dt>
<dd>                             I’m not sure yet; I’m new at this.                          </dd>
