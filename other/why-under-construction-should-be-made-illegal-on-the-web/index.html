<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why "Under Construction" should be made illegal on the web</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  The site  <a href="http://www.emr.fr/">www.emr.fr</a>  has been “under construction” for over eight years.  I noticed it in June 1996 and check back on it periodically.  Still Under Construction.  </p>
<p>  Another site that I noticed as “Under Construction”  in June 1996 is  <a href="http://www.leary.com/">www.leary.com</a>.  And as of this writing, it is <strong>still</strong>  under construction.  </p>
