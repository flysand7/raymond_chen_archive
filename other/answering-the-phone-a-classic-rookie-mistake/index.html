<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Answering the phone, a classic rookie mistake</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I had taken yesterday off from work just to take a breather, but I stopped by the office in the morning to pick up my bicycle helmet. (How I managed to leave my bicycle helmet at the office is not important.) My office telephone rang and I answered it.</p>
<p> As my colleague Ken described it later, “Ah, classic rookie mistake.” </p>
<p> The call was from an emergency meeting in another group. They called to put me on the hook for a problem with Windows Vista Setup because they believed that my group was responsible, being among those that recently <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/02/01/364840.aspx"> RI</a>‘d. I ended up staying until 4pm, then resuming the investigation at home for another few hours until the problem was identified. (The problem was introduced by another group, but they want my group to change its code to work around the problem.) </p>
<p> Now I need to take a day off from my day off. </p>
