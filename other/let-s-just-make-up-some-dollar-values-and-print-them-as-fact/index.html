<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Let’s just make up some dollar values and print them as fact</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Everybody is going nuts over a <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-5830435.html"> patent decision regarding the iPod interface</a>, but that’s not what I’m writing about (so don’t ask me for my opinion). Rather, I’m reacting to the claims being made by many people that <a href="http://digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=business&amp;id=2482"> Apple will have to pay Microsoft $10 for every iPod</a>.</p>
<p> What I want to know is where this amount “$10” came from. </p>
<p> Multiple people are confidently reporting a <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19960705"> sawbuck</a> as the amount in question. <a href="http://www.geekcoffee.net/archives/2005/08/apple_to_pay_mi.html"> GeekCoffee</a> attributes it to <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com">AppleInsider.com</a>, but a search of AppleInsider turns up no article where they assigned a monetary value to the issue. A site called <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=1765"> TrustedReviews</a> repeats the $10 price tag with no source. (“You don’t need a source. Just trust us!”) <a href="http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/gKfv32ZY30DN4h/Apple-Patent-Loss-May-Earn-Microsoft-10-Per-IPod.xhtml"> MacNewsWorld</a> even puts the amount in its headline, although the article gives no justification for how they arrived at it. <a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-13411878,00.html"> Sky News</a> helpfully converts the amount to £6 but again provides no source for this value. </p>
<p> Are people just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/08/54817.aspx"> making up stuff and publishing it as fact</a>? Or is there some root source for this $10 amount that I’m missing and which nobody is bothering to cite? (My suspicion is that one person took a wild guess and everybody else decided to run with it.) </p>
