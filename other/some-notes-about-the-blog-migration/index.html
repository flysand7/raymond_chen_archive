<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Some notes about the blog migration</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve opened a number of tickets with the blog migration team. Some of the issues have been fixed. The most significant remaining one is that many redirects from the old site are still broken. </p>
<p>In particular, the old URL <code>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/yyyy/mm/dd/nnnn.aspx</code> redirects to <code>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/archive/yyyy/mm/dd/nnnn.aspx</code> instead of to <code>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/<span style="border: solid 1px black">b</span>/oldnewthing/archive/yyyy/mm/dd/nnnn.aspx</code> </p>
<p>The solution when you see a bad redirect is to insert the missing <code>b/</code>. That will kick the redirection engine to send you to the correct final destination. </p>
<p>Well, sort-of. The final destination has a stray trailing slash, but the server doesn’t seem to mind. </p>
<p>Any other issues you see with the migration, put them in the comments below. </p>
<p>Thanks for your patience. </p>
