<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Poor man's comments: Inserting text that has no effect into a configuration file</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Consider a program which has a configuration file,
but the configuration file format does not have provisions for comments.
Maybe the program has a “list of authorized users”, where each line
takes the form
<code>allow x</code> or <code>deny x</code>,
where <code>x</code> is a group or user.
For example, suppose we have <code>access_list</code> that goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
allow payroll_department
deny alice
allow personnel_department
allow bob
</pre>
<p>
This is the sort of file that can really use comments
because people are going to want to know things like
“Why does Bob have access?”
</p>
<p>
One way of doing this is to embed the comments in the configuration
file in a way that has no net effect.
You can do this to add separator lines, too.
</p>
<pre>
deny !____________________________________________________________
allow payroll_department
deny !alice_is_an_intern_and_does_not_need_access_to_this_database
deny alice
deny !____________________________________________________________
allow personnel_department
deny !____________________________________________________________
deny !temporary_access_for_auditor
deny !see_service_request_31415
deny !access_expires_on_2001_12_31
allow bob
</pre>
<p>
Assuming that you don’t have any users whose names begin with
an exclamation point,
the extra <code>deny !...</code> lines have no effect:
They tell the system to deny access to a nonexistent user.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes finding the format of a line that has no effect can take some
creativity.
For example, if you have a firewall configuration file,
you might use URLs that correspond to no valid site.
</p>
<pre>
allow nobody http://example.com/PAYROLL_DEPARTMENT/--------------------
allow alice http://contoso.com/payroll/
allow nobody http://example.com/PURCHASING_DEPARTMENT/-----------------
allow bob http://contoso.com/purchasing/
allow nobody http://example.com/SPECIAL_REQUEST/-----------------------
allow ceo https://www.youtube.com/
</pre>
<p>
Of course, these extra lines create work for the program,
since it will sit there evaluating rules that will never apply.
You may have to craft them in a way so that they have minimum cost.
In the example above,
we assigned the comments to a user called
<code>nobody</code> which presumably will never try to access the Internet.
We definitely didn’t want to write the comment like
</p>
<pre>
allow * http://example.com/PAYROLL_DEPARTMENT/-------------------------
</pre>
<p>
because that would evaluate the dummy rule for every user.
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to add a layer of process,
you can tell everybody to stop editing the configuration files directly
and instead edit an alternate file that gets preprocessed into a
configuration file.
For example, we might have
<code>access_list.commented</code> that goes
</p>
<pre>
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
allow payroll_deparment
deny alice // payroll intern does not need access to this database.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
allow personnel_department
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
allow bob // Temporary access for auditor, see SR 31415. Expires 2001/12/31.
</pre>
<p>
Everybody agrees to edit the <code>access_list.commented</code> file,
and after each edit they run a script that sends the file through
the C++ preprocessor and puts the result in the
<code>access_list</code> file.
By using the C++ preprocessor, you enable features like
<code>#include</code> directives and
<code>#define</code> macros.</p>
