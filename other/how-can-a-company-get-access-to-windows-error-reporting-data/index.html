<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can a company get access to Windows Error Reporting data?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> What happens to all the crashes in programs not written by Microsoft that are submitted via Windows Error Reporting? Microsoft still collects and indexes them, and vendors <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/maintain/StartWER.mspx"> can sign up to gain access to the error reporting database</a> to see the crashes in their programs. The service is free, although it does require a <a href="https://winqual.microsoft.com/help/use_help/signing.aspx"> Verisign ID</a> so that the Winqual system can confirm that you are who you claim you are. (It would be bad if somebody could pretend to be, say, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/"> Adobe</a>, and get all their crash data.) </p>
<p> There will be a session at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/"> the PDC</a> which will go into how you the software developer can take advantage of all this data in order to improve your product from pre-release through general availability and even into sustained engineering. </p>

<p> Yes, it’s a kind of boring title. The original title was “Turning dissatisfied customers into gold”. I would’ve used something like “Your program is crashing. Are you listening?” Oh well, the title isn’t important. What’s important is that you can use this information to make your products better. </p>
