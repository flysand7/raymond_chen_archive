<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Windows NT Security in Theory and Practice</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Today, I’m not writing anything new. Instead, I’m referring you to the series of articles by Ruediger Asche starting with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnsecure/html/msdn_seccpp.asp"> Windows NT Security in Theory and Practice</a>. These articles are quite old but the principles are still sound. Just bear in mind that the newer stuff won’t be covered.</p>
