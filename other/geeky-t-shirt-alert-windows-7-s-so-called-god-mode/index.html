<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Geeky t-shirt alert: Windows 7's so-called God Mode</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Back in 2010, <a href="http://brandonlive.com/2010/01/04/the-so-called-god-mode/"> the so-called God Mode</a> was the hit discovery of the Internet, at least until the next cute cat video made the rounds. If you had stopped by the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/visitorcenter/en/us/location.aspx"> Microsoft Visitor Center</a> during that meme’s brief moment in the sun, and wandered into the gift shop, you could have picked up a t-shirt that said <code>{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}</code> on the front. </p>
<p> Of course, if you actually wore that shirt, you would also get stuffed into a locker and have your lunch money stolen from you. </p>
