<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the mouse cursor jump a few pixels when you right-click on the Start button?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I explained <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/25/10595729.aspx">why the mouse cursor jumps a few pixels if you click on the very bottom row of pixels on the taskbar</a>. Commenter ender noted that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/25/10595729.aspx#10596520">a similar jump occurs if you right-click the Start button</a>. What’s up with that? </p>
<p>This is not an issue with Fitts’s Law, because you already hit the target successfully. The purpose of the little mouse jump is to put the mouse into the menu. I guess the idea is that the people who designed that menu wanted to enable the mouse shortcut of right-click followed by left-click. When your taskbar is positioned at the bottom of the screen, this means that a right-click followed by left-click invokes the bottom menu item, which is <a href="http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.30"> normally</a> <i>Desktop</i>. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> menu was a secret feature, which isn’t quite the same as a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/12/10348441.aspx">rogue feature</a>. The feature was reviewed and approved, but it wasn’t something that was advertised. It was a bonus thing for power users. Allowing the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> menu to be customized was also intentional, and it’s a tricky balancing act to come up with a design that lets the menu be customized by the end user without making it too easy for applications to customize it as part of their installation. (There were a lot of designs that had to be abandoned. For example, we couldn’t incorporate the user’s SID in the hash due to the possibility that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/11/28/10576639.aspx">the user’s SID changes</a>.) </p>
