<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Cheap amusement: Searching for spelling errors in the registry</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
One source of cheap amusement is searching for spelling errors
in the registry.
For example, one program tried to register a new file extension,
or at least they tried,
except that they spelled <code>Extension</code> wrong.
</p>
<p>
And they wonder why that feature never worked.
</p>
<p>
My discovery was that my registry contained the mysterious key
<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\S</code>.
After some debugging, I finally found the culprit.
There was a program on my computer that did the equivalent of this:
</p>
<pre>
RegCreateKeyA(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, (PCSTR)L"Software\\...", &amp;hk);
</pre>
<p>
One of my colleagues remarked,
“With enough force, any peg will fit in any hole.”
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the code was not that aggressively wrong.
It was probably something

more subtle</a>.</p>
