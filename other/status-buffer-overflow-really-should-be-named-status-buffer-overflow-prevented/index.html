<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW really should be named STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_PREVENTED</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One category of dubious security vulnerability that comes into the security response team is people who recently discovered the <code>STATUS_<wbr/>BUFFER_<wbr/>OVERFLOW</code> status code.</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p><b>Title</b>: Buffer overflow occurs in scenario X</p>
<p><b>Description</b>: Run a file monitoring tool and perform scenario X. In the log, you will see entries that have the error <code>STATUS_<wbr/>BUFFER_<wbr/>OVERFLOW</code>. This is an easily reproducible buffer overflow bug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only the system were so smart that it could detect buffer overflows in this way. But what you’re seeing is not actual a buffer overflow. The status code <code>STATUS_<wbr/>BUFFER_<wbr/>OVERFLOW</code> does not mean that a buffer overflow has occurred; rather, it means that the buffer passed by the application was too small to hold all the requested data. Its name should really be <code>STATUS_<wbr/>BUFFER_<wbr/>OVERFLOW_<wbr/>PREVENTED</code> or <code>STATUS_<wbr/>INSUFFICIENT_<wbr/>BUFFER</code>. Indeed, the corresponding Win32 error code has the less misleading name <code>ERROR_<wbr/>INSUFFICIENT_<wbr/>BUFFER</code>.</p>
<p>Every wannabe security investigator sees this error code in a monitoring tool and says “Jackpot!” And then they send a report to the security response team and brag about it to their friends. “Dude, I found two dozen buffer overflows in just a few minutes. I am so <a href="http://www.31337.com/">31337</a>!”</p>
