<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is this magic setting that synthesizes Unicode from non-Unicode?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter dan g. wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/15/551897.aspx#552295"> how Windows can treat non-Unicode applications as Unicode via the Regional and Language Options control panel</a>, specifically the part that lets you choose the <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i>. “Having always believed that the only way to display, say, Chinese characters correctly was to compile with _UNICODE, this facility seems all the more remarkable.”</p>
<p> This setting is really not as magical as it appears. (After all, we had Chinese versions of 16-bit Windows that displayed Chinese characters just fine, and they certainly didn’t use Unicode since Unicode hadn’t been invented yet.) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/"> Michael Kaplan</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/pages/279998.aspx"> went through this and many other settings in the Regional and Language Options control panel</a>, and from the chart at the top of the page, you see what Windows XP calls the <i>Language for Non-Unicode Programs</i> used to go by the name <i>Default System Locale</i>. The old name does a better job of describing what it actually does but does a worse job of describing what it’s used <i>for</i>. </p>
<p> In Win32, three character encodings have special status. Unicode (more precisely, UTF-16) of course is what Windows uses internally. There are also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/08/389527.aspx"> two 8-bit code pages</a>: <code>CP_ACP</code>, the so-called <i>ANSI code page</i> (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/31/144893.aspx">even though it isn’t actually ANSI</a>), and the <code>CP_OEM</code> code page, the so-called <i>OEM code page</i> (even though <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/29/457483.aspx"> it isn’t provided by the OEM</a>). </p>
<p> When a non-Unicode program calls a function like <code>TextOutA</code> to display a string represented in the ANSI code page, the string is converted to Unicode via the <code>CP_ACP</code> code page. The <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i> setting controls what code page <code>CP_ACP</code> corresponds to. On U.S. systems, it’s typically <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.htm"> code page 1252</a>, but you can change it via that control panel. And that’s where it becomes possible to display Chinese characters without using Unicode. </p>
<p> For example, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/950.mspx"> code page 950</a> is a double-byte code page commonly seen in countries that use traditional Chinese characters. It can represent the English alphabet of A-Z, and through the use of double-byte characters can also represent a wide array of traditional Chinese characters, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/950/950_B3.mspx"> this block of characters which are represented by byte sequences of the form B3 40 through B3 FE</a>. If the ANSI code page is code page 950 and you pass data formatted for that code page to, say, the <code>TextOutA</code> function, the corresponding Chinese characters will display, even though the program itself doesn’t use Unicode explicitly. </p>
<p> That’s why it’s called the <i>Language for non-Unicode programs</i>. It specifies which character set non-Unicode data should be interpreted as. </p>
