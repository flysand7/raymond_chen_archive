<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Differences between managers and programmers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you find yourself in a meeting with a mix of managers  and programmers, here’s one way to tell the difference  between them:  Look at what they brough to the meeting.
  Did they bring a laptop computer?  Score bonus points if the laptop computer is actually  <strong>turned on</strong>  during the meeting or if the laptop is <strong>special</strong>  in some way (<i>e.g.</i>, it has a wireless card or it’s a Tablet PC).  If so, then that person is probably a manager.
  Did they come to the meeting empty-handed or with a spiral-bound  notebook?  If so, then that person is probably a programmer.</p>
<p>  It’s not an infallible test, but it works with surprisingly  high accuracy.  </p>
