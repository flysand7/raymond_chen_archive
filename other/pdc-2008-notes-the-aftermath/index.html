<p> The <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC43/"> Web page associated with my PDC 2008 talk</a> has been updated to include the source code that I used for all of the demos. </p>
<p> Other remarks: </p>
<ul>
<li>When I wrote, “If you know what’s good for you, don’t actually use a title image,” that was in the context of using group descriptions. If you watch the video, you’ll see that if you give a group description a title image, the title image is drawn on top of the text, which is, not to put too fine a point on it, hideous. If you’re going to go down the road of using the total information overload of group descriptions, at least use a blank title image. Of course, if you’re not using group descriptions, then go ahead and use title images; they look fine on their own. </li>

New white papers are added to the list every so often,     so it’s worth another look.  </li>
