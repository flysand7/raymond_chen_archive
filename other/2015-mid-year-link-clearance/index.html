<p>The semi-annual link clearance is here! </p>
<ul>
<li>    Windows 8 comes with a data compression API.     I was going to write a Little Program to demonstrate it,     but it turns out     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh920923(v=vs.85).aspx">    the MSDN sample</a> pretty much covers it,     so I’ll just incorporate it by reference. 
<li>    James Mickens says,     “<a href="http://vimeo.com/111122950">Life is terrible:     Let’s talk about the Web</a>“.     (Mickens appears to be making fun of Sweden in this talk.     The candles on the head are a tradition from     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Lucy%27s_Day">    St. Lucy’s Day</a>.) 
<li>    Tony Zhou explains     <a href="http://vimeo.com/113439313">    why Jackie Chan is the master of action comedy</a>. 
<li> <a href="http://www.pentadact.com/2014-08-08-the-formula-for-an-episode-of-murder-she-wrote/">    The formula for an episode of <i>Murder: She Wrote</i></a>
<li> <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2015/01/15/russell-wilson-body-doubles-former-football-players-commercials-movies-television/">    I’m Not Russell Wilson, But I Play Him on TV</a>:     The story of the people who play football in commercials,     movies, and TV shows. 
<li>    The show is on past my bedtime,     but I was intriguged by     <a href="http://www.alex-buono.com/how-we-did-it-snl-titles-sequence/">    how they created the SNL title sequence</a>.     Favorite part: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a>.     TL;DR: They used a variety of in-camera techinques. 
<li>    I am fascinated by the processes that operate behind the scenes.     <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/floating-feasts"> <i>Floating Feasts</i></a>     describes what it takes to feed an entire cruise ship,     specifically Royal Caribbean’s Oasis.     A dozen pillow-sized bags of uncooked French fries?     “That’s about five minutes’ worth.”     The passengers “eat a metric ton of lobster during a typical     seven-day cruise.”     Also fascinating is how food consumption varies with     the type of passengers. 
<li> <a href="http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/google-street-view-cruise-ship/">    Wander around the Allure of the Seas</a>,     courtesy of Google Street View.     (The Allure of the Seas is the sister ship of the Oasis.) 
<li>    Because Japan:     <a href="http://www.bijint.com/">Bijin-tokei</a>,     the “beauty clock”.     Operated by the Japanese modeling agency     <a href="http://www.bijin-co.jp/">Bijin</a>. 
<li>    Because Japan:     <a href="http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/">    Another Japanese clock</a> (warning: strange music),     this one run by Japanese casual-clothing company     <a href="http://www.uniqlo.jp/">Uniqlo</a>.     I can’t describe this one except to say that it’s from Japan.     (They also have a     <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/calendar/">calendar</a>     consisting of tilt-shift time-lapse movies.) 
<li>    6502 flashback:     <a href="http://www.6502.org/source/interpreters/sweet16.htm">    Steve Wozniak’s Sweet 16 interpreter for the 6502</a>.     It’s been quipped that the 6502 is really a RISC chip with 256 registers     (the zero page), with the caveat that you have to write your     program in microcode.     Woz does it in 300 bytes.     Because he’s Woz. 
<li>    6502 flashback:     <a href="http://www.6502.org/source/floats/wozfp1.txt">    Floating point routines for the 6502</a>,     by Roy Rankin and Steve Wozniak.     This, my friends, is how real programmers do it. 
<li>    And the last double of the day:     <a href="http://www.startrekcontinues.com/">Star Trek Continues</a>,     <a href="http://www.startrekphase2.de/">Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II</a>.     (Bonus reading:     <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/07/04/startrekphaseii.html">    Getting every set detail down</a>.) </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
