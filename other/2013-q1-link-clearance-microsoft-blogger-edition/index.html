<li> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nadyne/archive/2006/08/29/730630.aspx">     The Microsoft fallacy</a>.     Nadyne’s third fallacy is something I see when other companies who     are interested in employee blogging ask,     “How does Microsoft’s PR department manage 5000 bloggers     all of whom will say exactly what you tell them to say?”     It makes the underlying assumption that bloggers are     <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/how_microsoft_blogging_pr_works.html">     working closely with the PR department</a>,     when in fact I bet most bloggers can’t     even name a single person in the PR department beyond maybe     Frank X. Shaw. </li>

I don’t think I’ve ever written a compiler,     but I’ve written a good number of interpreters.     I guess that makes me a marginally better programmer. </li>
<li>More information about notification icons,     notification GUIDs,     and how a digital signature     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/asklar/archive/2012/03/06/system-tray-notification-area-icons.aspx">     lets your app take its     notification icon to a new location</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/calvin_hsia/">     Calvin Hsia</a>     was Microsoft’s first Most Valuable Professional (MVP).     MVP originally stood for     <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2013/feb13/02-21MVP.aspx">     Most Verbose People</a>, since they were the people who     were most active on the message boards. </li>
<li> <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/The-Defrag-Show">     The Defrag Show</a>     is Channel 9’s tech support and troubleshooting show.     Co-host Gov Maharaj is described in the blurb as     “tech troubleshooter extraordinaire”.     It sounds like an exaggeration, but it’s not.     This show is not to be confused with the similarly-named… </li>
<li> <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Defrag-Tools">     Defrag Tools</a>.     This is the show about serious hard-core debugging.     (I’m plugging my friends here, because Gov, Andrew, and I     are frequent contributors to the “Hard-Core Debugging” sessions     at Microsoft’s internal technical conference known as     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TechReady">TechReady</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/01/10099005.aspx">     My TechEd China 2010</a> presentation was basically a tweaked version     of one of my “Hard-Core Debugging” talks.     Though given the stunned silence from the audience during my     presentation, I figure that either I was phenomenally boring     or that the information was too advanced. Or both.) </li>
