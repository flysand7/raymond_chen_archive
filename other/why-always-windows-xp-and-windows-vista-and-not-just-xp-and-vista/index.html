<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why always "Windows XP" and "Windows Vista" and not just "XP" and "Vista"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When the Internet Explorer folks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/04/688899.aspx"> announced</a> that they were going to call their next version of Internet Explorer <i>Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP</i> and <i>Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista</i>, many people responded to the awkward name by suggesting that it be shortened to <i>Internet Explorer 7 XP</i> and <i>Internet Explorer 7 Vista</i>. Why the longer names?
 Lawyers.
 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/windows.mspx"> Microsoft’s own trademark guidelines</a>† specify that the product names are <i>Windows XP</i> and <i>Windows Vista</i> and not just <i>XP</i> and <i>Vista</i>. The trademark is on the entire phrase, not just the last word. Furthermore, the trademark guidelines specify that products may not append just <i>XP</i> or <i>Vista</i> to their names; they have to say <i>X for Windows XP</i> or <i>X for Windows Vista</i>.
 In an earlier era, you had to be careful to say <i>Windows NT</i> and not just <i>NT</i> for the same reason. You see, the name <i>NT</i> is a registered trademark of Northern Telecom, and part of the agreement with “the other NT” is that the Windows product would always be used with the word <i>Windows</i> in front.
 If you took a close look at the Windows 2000 box, you may have seen the phrase “Built on NT Technology.” I don’t know how hard it was to do, but I suspect a good amount of negotiations with Northern Telecom took place to allow Microsoft to use that alternate formulation without the word <i>Windows</i> in front. Indeed, if you looked really closely at the box, you’d have found a trademark acknowledgement for Northern Telecom deep in the fine print.
 Lawyers by training are very cautious people. After all, a new lawsuit against Microsoft gets filed approximately once every thirty seconds.¶ They’re probably also responsible for all your Office# shortcuts on the Start menu being named <i>Microsoft Office This 2007</i> and <i>Microsoft Office That 2007</i> instead of <i>This 2007</i> and <i>That 2007</i>, or even (shocking!) just <i>This</i> and <i>That</i>. It’s a daring move, and lawyers don’t like to be daring. Nobody ever got sued for playing it safe.††

 *Just burning off a footnote marker because I don’t like asterisks.
 †I myself violate some of these guidelines because I try to write like a human being and not <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/19/453614.aspx"> a robot</a>. Only robots say <i>Windows-based programs</i>.‡
 ‡That statement is not literally true. Here’s a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of robots:§ “People who say <i>Windows-based programs</i> sound like robots.”
 §That statement is also not literally true. Here’s a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of people who take a robotic approach to reading: “Here’s a reformulation of that statement for the benefit of people who take a robotic approach to reading:”
 ||Burning off another footnote marker because I don’t like parallel lines either.
 ¶An exaggeration, not a statement of fact.

<p> ††Okay, maybe somebody somewhere has gotten sued for playing it safe. It was just a catchy sentence, not a statement of fact. </p>
