<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Crackpots in computer security: The neighbors are looking at me weird</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The security team gets all sorts of email to report security issues. <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/23100/"> Nearly 200,000 each year</a>. And of course the reports vary in quality greatly. The ones I’m fascinated by are the crackpots.</p>
