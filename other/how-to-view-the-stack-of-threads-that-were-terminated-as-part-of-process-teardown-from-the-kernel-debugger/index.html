<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to view the stack of threads that were terminated as part of process teardown from the kernel debugger</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
As we saw some time ago,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/03/2383346.aspx">
process shutdown is a multi-phase affair</a>.
After you call <code>ExitProcess</code>,
all the threads are forcibly terminated.
After that’s done, each DLL is sent a <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>
notification.
You may be debugging
a problem with <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> handling
that suggests that some of those threads were not cleaned up properly.
For example, you might assert that a reference count is zero,
and you find during process shutdown that this assertion sometimes fires.
Maybe you terminated a thread before it got a chance to release
its reference?
How can you test this theory if the thread is already gone?
</p>
<p>
It so happens that when all the threads are terminated during the
early phase of process shutdown,
the kernel is a bit lazy and doesn’t free their stacks.
It figures, hey, the entire process is going away soon,
so the stack memory is going to be cleaned up as part of process
termination.
(It’s sort of the kernel equivalent of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/05/10253268.aspx">
not bothering to sweep the floor
of a building that’s about to be demolished</a>.)
You can use this to your advantage by <i>grovelling the stacks
that were left behind</i>.
</p>
<p>
Hey, this is why you get called in to debug the hard stuff, right?

The first step is to identify where all the stacks are.
The direct approach is difficult because the stacks can be all
different sizes, so it’s not easy to pick them out of a line-up.
But one thing does come in a consistent size: The

TEB</a>.

<p>
From the kernel debugger, use the <code>!process</code> command
to dump the process you are interested in,
and from the header information, extract the <code>VadRoot</code>.
</p>
<pre>
1: kd&gt; !process -1
PROCESS 8731bd40  SessionId: 1  Cid: 0748    Peb: 7ffda000  ParentCid: 0620
    DirBase: 4247b000  ObjectTable: 96f66de0  HandleCount: 104.
    Image: oopsie.exe
    <font color="red"><u>VadRoot 893de570</u></font> Vads 124 Clone 0 Private 518. Modified 643. Locked 0.
    DeviceMap 995628c0
</pre>
<p>
Dump this VAD root with the <code>!vad</code> command,
and pay attention only to the entries which say
<code>1 Private READWRITE</code>.
</p>
<pre>
1: kd&gt; !vad <u>893de570</u>
VAD     level      start      end    commit

(If you are debugging from user mode, then you can use
<code>!vadump</code> but the output format is different.)
</p>
<p>
Each of these is a candidate TEB.
In practice, TEBs tend to be allocated at the high end of memory,
so the ones with a low <code>start</code> value are probably
red herrings.
Therefore, you should investigate these candidates in reverse order.
</p>
<p>
For each candidate, take the <code>start</code> address and append
three zeroes.
(Each page on x86 is 4KB, which conveniently maps to 1000 in hex.)
Dump the first seven
pointers of the TEB with the <code>dp xxxxx000 L7</code>
command.
</p>
<pre>
1: kd&gt; dp 7ffdf000 L7
7ffdf000  0016fbb0 00170000 0016b000 00000000
7ffdf010  00001e00 00000000 7ffdf000 ← hit
</pre>
<p>
If the TEB is valid, then the seventh pointer points back
to the start of the TEB.
In a valid TEB,
the second and third values are the
stack limits; in this case, the candidate stack lives between
<code>0016b000</code> and <code>00170000</code>.
(As a double-check, you can verify that the upper limit of the
stack, <code>00170000</code> in this case, matches up with
the end of a VAD allocation in the <code>!vad</code> output above.)
</p>
<p>
Now that you know where the stack is, you can <code>dps</code> it
and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/09/10138401.aspx">
look for EBP frames</a>.
(I usually start about two to four pages below the upper limit of the stack.)
Test out each candidate EBP frame with the <code>k=</code> command
until you find one that seems to be solid.
Record this candidate stack trace in a text file for further study.
</p>
<p>
Repeat for each candidate TEB, and you will eventually reconstruct
what each thread in the process was doing at the moment it was
terminated.
If you’re really lucky, you might even see the code that incremented
the reference count
but was terminated before it could release it.
</p>
<p>
The above discussion also applies to debugging 64-bit processes.
However, instead of looking for
<code>1 Private READWRITE</code> pages, you want to look for
<code>2 Private READWRITE</code> pages.
As an additional wrinkle, if you are debugging ia64, then converting
a page frame to a linear address is sadly not as simple as appending
three zeroes.
Pages on ia64 are 8KB, not 4KB, so you need to shift the value left
by 25 bits: Add three zeroes and then multiply by two.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if you are debugging a 32-bit process on x64,
then you want to look for <code>3 Private READWRITE</code> pages,
but add 2 before appending the three zeroes.
That’s because the TEB for a 32-bit process on x64 is really two
TEBs glued together: A 64-bit TEB followed by a 32-bit TEB.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>:
I did not come up with this debugging technique on my own.
I learned it from an even greater debugging genius.

Next time</a>, we’ll look at debugging this issue from a user-mode
debugger.

<p>
<b>Trivia</b>:
The informal term for these terminated-but-not-yet-completely-destroyed
threads is <i>ghost threads</i>.
The term was coined by the Exchange support team,
because they often have to study server failures
that require them to do this type of investigation,
and they needed a cute name for it.</p>
