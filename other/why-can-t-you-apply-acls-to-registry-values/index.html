<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can’t you apply ACLs to registry values?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Someone wondered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/18/7145021.aspx#7150078"> why you can’t apply ACLs to individual registry values</a>, only to the containing keys.</p>
<p> You already know enough to answer this question; you just have to put the pieces together. </p>
<p> In order for a kernel object to be ACL-able, you need to be able to create a handle to it, since it is the act of creating the handle that performs the access check. </p>
<p> Creating a handle to the value means that we would need a function like <code>RegOpenValue</code> and corresponding <code>RegQueryValueData</code> and <code>RegSetValueData</code> functions which take not a registry key handle but a registry value handle. </p>
<p> And then you’ve basically come full circle. You’ve reinvented the 16-bit registry, where data was stored only in the tips of the trees. Just change <i>value</i> to <i>subkey</i> and you’re back where you started. </p>
<p> What would be the point of adding an additional layer that just re-expresses what you had before, just in a more complicated way? </p>
<p> Commenter bcthanks wondered why <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/18/7145021.aspx#7167391"> we didn’t abandon values and just stored everything in subkeys, like the 16-bit registry did</a>. Well, if you want to do that, then more power to you. Though it would make it difficult for you to store anything other than <code>REG_SZ</code> data in the registry. If you wrote a <code>REG_BINARY</code> blob to the default value of a subkey, what should be returned if somebody called <code>RegQueryValue</code> which always returns a string? </p>
