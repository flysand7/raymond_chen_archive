<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dlaczego Microsoft zatopił Polskę?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A colleague of mine stopped by my office to tell me that he got a telephone call from his father in Poland asking him <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/27/880411.aspx"> why Microsoft sunk Poland</a>. My colleague was somewhat baffled by this question, since his father isn’t a computer nerd, but his father explained that he saw the story on the front page of the newspaper. Apparently, <a href="http://gospodarka.gazeta.pl/gospodarka/1,68367,3707792.html"> the story ran in the largest Polish newspaper</a>, but it doesn’t appear that they credited their source, demonstrating that quality journalism is hard to find in any country. My guess is that the jump into Poland came from <a href="http://www.centrumxp.pl/aktualnosci/3204,dlaczego_microsoft_zatopi%C5%82_polsk%C4%99.aspx"> this page</a>, which does credit my article. I’m just guessing, though, since I can’t read Polish. </p>
<p> I just found it weird to see my stuff spreading all the way to general-audience newspapers in Poland. </p>
