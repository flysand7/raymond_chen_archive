<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Debugging walkthrough: Access violation on nonsense instruction, episode 3</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A colleague of mine asked for help debugging a strange failure. Execution halted on what appeared to be a nonsense instruction. <span id="more-91711"></span></p>
<pre>
eax=022b13a0 ebx=00000000 ecx=02570df4 edx=769f4544 esi=02570dec edi=05579748
eip=76c49131 esp=05cce038 ebp=05cce07c iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na po nc
cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00010202
KERNELBASE!GetFileAttributesExW+0x2:
76c49131 ec              in      al,dx
</pre>
<p>This is clearly an invalid instruction. But observe that the offset is +2, which is normally the start of the function, because the first two bytes of Windows operating system functions are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/21/10214405.aspx">a <code>mov edi, edi</code> instruction</a>. Therefore, the function is corrupted. Lets look back two bytes to see if it gives any clues. </p>

KERNELBASE!GetFileAttributesExW:
76c4912f e95aecebf3      jmp     IoLog!Mine_GetFileAttributesExW (6ab07d8e)
</pre>
<p>Oh look, somebody is doing API patching (already unsupported) and they did a bad job. They tried to patch code while a thread was in the middle of executing it, resulting in a garbage instruction. </p>
<p>This is a bug in IoLog. The great thing about API patching is that when you screw up, it looks like an OS bug. That way, nobody ever files bugs against you! </p>
<p>(In this case, IoLog is a diagnostic tool which is logging file I/O performed by an application which is being instrumented.) </p>
<p>My colleague replied, “Thanks. Looks like a missing lock in IoLog. It doesn’t surprise me that API patching isn’t supported…” </p>
