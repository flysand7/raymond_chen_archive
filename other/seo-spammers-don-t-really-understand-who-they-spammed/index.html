<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">SEO spammers don’t really understand who they spammed</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It doesn’t happen any more, but back in the day, a piece of SEO spam would occasionally sneak through the corporate mail filters. Here’s an excerpt from one.

<p>Yes, those styles are taken from the original, which may give you some sort of idea what results to expect. (Maybe they honed their skills on GeoCities.)</p>
<p>It’s funny that they send their pitch to large multinational corporations, as if those corporations don’t have an entire department devoted to maintaining and optimizing the corporate Web site. Maybe I should ask for a quote?</p>
<p>Funnier would be is if they had sent the same spam to Google. (Anybody from Google want to confirm? Were you tempted to write back?)</p>
<p>Here’s another.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>While studying your website I couldn’t help noticing it lacked any significant ranking in Google.</p></blockquote>
