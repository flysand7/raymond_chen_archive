<p>Why are all Windows drivers dated June 21, 2006? Don’t you ever update drivers? Are you just a bunch of slackers? </p>
<p>What’s more, the date of June 21, 2006 applies even to drivers like Storage Spaces, which didn’t even exist in 2006! Has the Research division been using their time machine again? </p>
<p>The dates on all Windows drivers are set to June 21, 2006. The version number increases over time, but the timestamp stays put. </p>
<p>My colleague Zac <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/5hediy/is_windows_10_still_a_polished_vista_kernel/dazjyiw/">explains</a>: When the system looks for a driver to use for a particular piece of hardware, it ranks them according to various criteria. If a driver provides a perfect match to the hardware ID, then it becomes a top candidate. And if more than one driver provides a perfect match, then the one with the most recent timestamp is chosen. If there is still a tie, then the one with the highest file version number is chosen. </p>
<p>Suppose that the timestamp on the driver matched the build release date. And suppose you had a custom driver provided by the manufacturer. When you installed a new build, the driver provided by Windows will have a newer timestamp than the one provided by the manufacturer. Result: When you install a new build, all your manufacturer-provided drivers get replaced by the Windows drivers. Oops. </p>
<p>Intentionally backdating the drivers avoids this problem. It means that if you have a custom manufacturer-provided driver, it will retain priority over the Windows-provided driver. On the other hand, if your existing driver was the Windows-provided driver from an earlier build, then the third-level selection rule will choose the one with the higher version number, which is the one from the more recent build. </p>
<p>It all works out in the end, but it does look a bit funny. </p>
<p>Zac told me, “It’s an awesome example of something that seems stupid and insignificant turning out to have a profound purpose.” </p>
