<p>Some time ago, the application compatibility folks found a program that was corrupting the heap, and they applied a fix that worked around the specific type of corruption that the program performed.
 And then a bug came on that same program. It was a heap corruption failure during the program’s processing of global destructors.
 The authors of that program were so clever, they found a way around the compatibility fix and managed to corrupt the heap anyway!</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: To clarify, there was no updated version of the program. (That’s why I wrote “that same program” and not “an updated version of that program”.) There was a bug in <i>XYZ Version 2.1</i>. We added a compatibility fix for it. And then later, another bug came in, also for <i>XYZ Version 2.1</i> showing that the compatibility fix wasn’t good enough. We tried to fix their heap corruption, but they were too clever and corrupted it in another way in a different part of the program. </p>
