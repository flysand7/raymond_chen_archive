<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do Microsoft customer records use the abbreviation "cx" for customer?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As is common in many industries, Microsoft customer service records employ abbreviations for many commonly-used words. In the travel industry, for example, <i>pax</i> is used as an abbreviation for <i>passenger</i>. The term appears to have spread to the <a href="http://www.proz.com/kudoz/English/tourism_travel/888545-pax.html"> hotel industry</a>, even though people who stay at a hotel aren’t technically <i>passengers</i>. (Well, unless you think that with the outrageous prices charged by the hotels, the people are being <i>taken for a ride</i>.)
 For a time, the standard abbreviation for <i>customer</i> in Microsoft’s customer service records was <i>cu</i>. This changed, however, when it was pointed out to the people in charge of such things that <i>cu</i> is a swear word in Portuguese. The standard abbreviation was therefore changed to <i>cx</i>.
 If you’re reading through old customer records and you know Portuguese and you see the word <i>cu</i>, please understand that we are not calling the customer a rude name.
 The person who introduced me to this abbreviation added, “I just spell out the word. It’s not that much more work, and it’s a lot easier to read.”
 Some years ago, I was asked to review a technical book, and one of the items of feedback I returned was that the comments in the code fragments were full of mysterious abbreviations. “Sgnl evt before lv cs.” I suggested that the words be spelled out or, if you really want to use abbreviations, at least have somewhere in the text where the abbreviations are explained.</p>
<p> If I had wanted to demonstrate the social skills of a thermonuclear device, my feedback might have read “unls wrtg pzl bk, avd unxplnd n unnec abbvs.” </p>
