<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Typo patrol at the PDC</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> You can find the following typographical errors in the Big Room at the PDC: </p>
<ul>
<li>Intergrated </li>
<li>Precison </li>
<li>Personel </li>
</ul>
<p> If you can locate all three of them and catch me at the PDC (say at the Fundamentals Lounge or at the Ask the Experts table), I’ll award you a prize of um (rummaging through my bag) how about a retractable network cable? (Or an autographed business card? But then again, anybody can get one of those just by asking for one.) </p>
