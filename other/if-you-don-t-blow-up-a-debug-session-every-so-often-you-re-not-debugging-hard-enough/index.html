<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you don’t blow up a debug session every so often, you’re not debugging hard enough</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was helping a customer live-debug an assertion failure in an automated test running in a lab. I messed up an attempt to unwind the stack to restart a call and ended up corrupting the process state. Undaunted, I realized that the issue at hand was that one specific API call was failing, so I said to myself, “That’s okay if I can’t restart the call. I can just <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151016-00/?p=91341">simulate the call</a>!” so I patched registers and manually pushed data onto the stack and all that stuff. </p>
<p>And then I stepped through the code, and it crashed because I messed up one detail: When virtually pushing the return address on the stack, I had a mental lapse and subtracted 4 from the stack pointer even though this was a 64-bit machine and I should have subtracted 8. Due to the stack misalignment, the code eventually crashed on a <code>movaps</code> instruction several stack frames deep into the function. </p>
<p>I blew up the debug session not once but twice. </p>
<p>If this happens to you, don’t beat yourself up. If you don’t blow up a debug session every so often, then you’re not debugging hard enough. </p>
<p>(That punch line is a ripoff of something I heard the <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">Car Talk</a> guys say: “If you don’t <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070717-01/?p=25973">stall a manual transmission</a> every so often, then you’re not driving it right.”) </p>
