<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Jag är inte heller en Microsoft-talesman på svenska</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The Swedes haven’t quite figured out that my blog entries <a href="http://techworld.idg.se/2.2524/1.111488"> do not constitute the official position of Microsoft Corporation</a>. I like how they don’t even mention my name anywhere. They just say “Microsoft doesn’t this” and “Microsoft doesn’t that”. If you go back to the article they used as a source, you’ll see that I provided a variety of reasons for not going into the Start menu point system, but this author decided to claim that reason 1 was not only the only reason but in fact the official reason. </p>
<p> Perhaps I should have used a CGI script which randomized the order of the items each time you refreshed. </p>
