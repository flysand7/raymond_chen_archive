<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The best book on ActiveX programming ever written</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was introduced to the glory that is the world of <a href="http://www.mrbunny.com/">Mr. Bunny</a> many years ago. <a href="http://www.mrbunny.com/mbgtax.html">Mr. Bunny’s Guide to ActiveX</a> is probably the best book on ActiveX programming ever written.</p>
<p> If you haven’t figured it out by now, it’s a humor book, but it’s the sort of madcap insane geek humor that has enough truth in it to make you laugh more. </p>
<p> My favorite is the first exercise from the first chapter: Connect the dots.  (Warning: It’s harder than it looks!) </p>
