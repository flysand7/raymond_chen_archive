<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Crashes in the I/O stack tend to occur in programs which do the most I/O</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was diagnosing repeated blue screen errors on their system. They shared a few crash dumps, and they all had a similar profile: The crash occurred in the file system filter stack as the I/O request passed through the anti-virus software. </p>
<p>Some of the crashes reported <code>PROCESS_NAME: ngen.exe</code>. “Could <code>ngen.exe</code> be the problem?” <span id="more-91821"></span></p>
<p>As a general rule, user-mode code cannot be responsible for blue-screen failures. It’s the job of the kernel to be resistant to misbehavior in user-mode. Failures of the form <code>IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL</code> and <code>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA</code> are typically driver bugs or faulty hardware (for example, due to overheating or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx">overclocking</a>). </p>
<p>The application that happened to be active at the time of the failure is not typically interesting in and of itself, although it can give a clue as to what part of the kernel is misbehaving. The fact that <code>ngen</code> appears is more an indication that <code>ngen</code> performs a lot of disk I/O, so if there’s a problem in the I/O stack, there’s a good chance that <code>ngen</code> was involved, simply because <code>ngen</code> is involved in a lot of I/O requests. </p>

<li>Bob goes to the beach very frequently. 
<li>Every time there is a     <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jaws-sharknado-americas-obsession-sharks-growing/story?id=24927068">    shark attack</a>,     Bob is at the beach. 
<li>Conclusion: Bob causes shark attacks. </li></li></li></ul>
<p>Blaming <code>ngen</code> for the kernel crash is like blaming Bob for the shark attacks. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Some of my colleagues came to different conclusions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Conclusion: Bob should stop going to the beach. 
<li>Conclusion: Bob must be the shark. </li></li></ul>
