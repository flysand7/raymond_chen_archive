<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The psychology of confirmation, or something, I don't know what to call it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There is probably a name for this phenomenon. I will illustrate it below.
 “Is there a way to configure the system to do X?”

 “It doesn’t work.”
 — <i>I just tried it. It works for me. I’m using ⟨configuration details⟩.</i></p>
<p> “Thanks. It’s working.” </p>
