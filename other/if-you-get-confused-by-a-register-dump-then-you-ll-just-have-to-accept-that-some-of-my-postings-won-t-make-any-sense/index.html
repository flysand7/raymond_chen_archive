<p>This Web site is not for beginners. I try to write for advanced programmers, and if you’re not an advanced programmer, then you’ll just have to accept that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/14/6188257.aspx#6226024"> there will be times you are baffled by what I write</a>. Often I dial the geek back a notch, explaining some things which should be “obvious” to an advanced programmer, such as why storing a constant pointer into a stack location from dynamically-generated code is a clear indicator of a framework thunk. But I will dial it back only so far, and eventually you may just be forced to (horrors!) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/29/8436335.aspx#8438384"> do your own background research</a> to get yourself up to speed or simply give up and see if you have better luck with the next entry.</p>
<p> There are some topics I have sitting in my ideas folder which I will probably never actually post about because they are so advanced that even <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/"> Don Box</a>, COM guru extraordinaire, admitted in email to me that they’re too advanced <i>even for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201634465?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201634465"> his super-advanced book on COM</a></i>. At the PDC, talks used to be categorized as 100, 200, 300, or 400-level, mimicking the categorization of classes at most U.S. universities, with 100-level classes being introductory, and 400-classes being college senior seminar type stuff. COM weak <code>QueryInterface</code> would be somewhere at the graduate research level. Stuff so esoteric, nobody would actually need to know it. </p>
<p> To be honest, I don’t think I’ve written anything truly advanced in a long time. It’s all been fairly intermediate for the past few years. People don’t seem to mind too much, so I’ll just keep it going. </p>
