Occasionally, somebody will ask for help on a distribution list,

I’m using the XYZ toolset to do some document management,
and I want the server to run a script whenever somebody tries to
modify the master template,
so it can run validations before accepting the update,
such as verifying that the person making the change has
received the proper approvals.
Is that possible?
</p>

<p>
It turns out that this is something the XYZ toolset already
knows how to do.

<p>
You can create a <code>conditions</code> configuration file
which adds a condition that validates that the request
satisfies whatever conditions you require.

Yes, that is what I am looking for.
Where can I find information on how to write the validation
script and how to implement it on the server?

On http://xyztoolset/, go to <i>Server setup</i>,
then <i>Conditions</i>.

Another colleague with a lot of experience with the XYZ toolset
stepped in with some more useful advice:
</p>

<p>
Instead of developing scripts from scratch, you may want to
start with the pre-written scripts that come with the XYZ toolset
add-on pack.
There are already modules for things like scanning the
<i>Description</i> field for approval IDs.
Note also that you may want to include some way of changing
the rules dynamically as your processes change
(for example, maybe one of the approvers goes on vacation and
delegates approval authority to somebody else,
or maybe your project goes into a “no approval necessary” phase)
rather than just hard-coding the rules.
</p>

That’s a good idea.
Is there a way to easily disable a validation script?
</p>

<blockquote class="q">

</p>
<p>
Um, you can just
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/04/9856634.aspx">
build this into your validation script</a>.
</p>
<pre>
if (File.Exists(@"\\project\admin\no_validation")) {
   return Validation.Passed;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q">

</p>
<p>
Or you can have a magic word in the <i>Description</i> that
disables validation.
Features like this and the one Raymond describes are available
in the add-on pack.
Look in the <code>Sentinel</code> and <code>Description­Match</code>
modules.

I’m having trouble getting this working.
The documentation says I should do something like
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\path\to\file.ext"
           action="C:\path\to\validate.xyz" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If I use a shared network path for my validation script,
I get “access denied”.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\Nosebleed\MasterTemplate.xml"
           action="\\project\admin\validate.xyz" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If I use an internal path:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;condition file="$\Nosebleed\MasterTemplate.xml"
           action="$\Scripts\validate.xyz" &gt;
</pre>
<p>
I get “file not found”.
I added $\Scripts\validate.xyz to the document repository,
so the server should be able to see it.
Am I missing something obvious here?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(I like how this person just made up a feature,
in this case, using a repository path as an action
rather than a physical file path.)
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>

</p>
<p>
My psychic powers tell me that the account under which the
server is running does not have access to
<code>\\project\admin\validate.xyz</code>.
And adding the validation script to the document repository
allows the server to access it only if <i>the server
has an active (and up-to-date) workspace joined to the repository</i>.
Sure the server has a copy of validate.xyz, but that copy
is in the repository <i>database</i>.
(Adding a file to the repository is more than just a “copy” operation.)
</p>
<p>
I would not be surprised if having the server also maintain
a live workspace in itself is not a recommended practice.

<blockquote class="q">

<p>
I agree with your assessment of the “access denied” issue,
but I really don’t want the validate.xyz script to reside
on an external share.
Where is the best place to put the script?
On the server or a share?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q">

</p>
<p>
The documentation for the XYZ add-on pack recommends
putting the scripts on the server,
accessible via a share.
</p>

<blockquote class="q">
<p>

</p>
<p>
But that’s what I did, and the result was “access denied.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>

</p>
<p>
No, that’s not what you did.
The recommendation is to put the scripts on the server
(C:\Scripts\validate.xyz) and then share out your scripts
(net share Scripts=C:\Scripts) so administrators can update
them remotely.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
<b>From</b>: X
</p>
<p>
I read the XYZ Toolkit documentation for <code>conditions</code>,
and it says
“Get an IT-managed share created.”
I suppose I need to contact the IT department to have that done.
Correct?

<p>
At this point, I got tired of hand-holding.
