 Some time ago, I received a notification that went like this:</p>

<p> Well that clears things up.</p>
<p> Curiously, the message includes an incident duration but doesn’t have an ETA. Thankfully, the message was sent one minute after the incident was over, so by the time I got it, everything was back to normal. </p>
