<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Somebody actually took the time to translate my book into Japanese, it appears</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I have no idea who they are (since I can’t read Japanese), but <a href="http://b.hatena.ne.jp/">hatena</a> appears to be some sort of Japanese social bookmarking site, and I’ll often find hits from them in my referrer logs. One of the members <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/tetsuarossa/20070829/p1"> found a newly-issued Japanese translation of my book</a>, which opens up a whole new audience to my obnoxious personality.
 Stumbling across <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4756150004"> the Japanese edition</a> was a bit of a surprise. I mean, yeah, the book contract has some paragraphs about translations, but seriously, who actually expects their book to be translated? That’s just standard book contract boilerplate stuff.</p>
<p> What next, a movie deal? </p>
