<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mundane git commit-tree tricks, Part 7: Combining more than two files into one while preserving line history, manual octopus merging</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/other/mundane-git-tricks-combining-two-files-into-one-while-preserving-line-history"> Last time</a>, we saw how to combine two files to form a third file, while preserving line history. But what if you need to combine more than two files? For example, maybe you want to take a whole bunch of <code>csv</code> files and merge them into one big file, but still track the origin of each line.</p>
<p>Let’s set up a scratch repo to try it out.</p>
<pre>git init

&gt;fruits echo apple
&gt;&gt;fruits echo grape
&gt;&gt;fruits echo orange
git add fruits
git commit --author="Alice &lt;alice&gt;" -m "create fruits"

&gt;veggies echo celery
&gt;&gt;veggies echo lettuce
&gt;&gt;veggies echo peas
git add veggies
git commit --author="Bob &lt;bob&gt;" -m "create veggies"

&gt;dairy echo cheese
&gt;&gt;dairy echo eggs
&gt;&gt;dairy echo milk
git add dairy
git commit --author="Carol &lt;carol&gt;" -m "create dairy"

git tag ready
</pre>
<p>We can use the trick from last time to merge two files, and extend it to three files by performing an octopus merge.</p>
<pre>git checkout -b d2f
git mv dairy food
git commit -m "dairy to food"
git checkout -

git checkout -b f2f
git mv fruits food
git commit -m "fruits to food"
git checkout -

git checkout -b v2f
git mv veggies food
git commit -m "veggies to food"
git checkout -

git merge d2f f2f v2f
</pre>
<p>Except that it doesn’t work. In fact, it explodes quite spectacularly.</p>
<pre>Fast-forwarding to: d2f
Trying simple merge with f2f
Simple merge did not work, trying automatic merge.
Added food in both, but differently.
fatal: unable to read blob object e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
error: Could not stat : No such file or directory
ERROR: content conflict in food
fatal: merge program failed
Automated merge did not work.
<b>Should not be doing an octopus.</b>
Merge with strategy octopus failed.
</pre>
<p>I like that second-to-last line that scolds you for attempting this sort of thing in the first place.</p>
<p>Let’s clean up the work that merge had left in progress. You normally would do this with a <code>git merge --abort</code>, but octopus merges are not abortable because they don’t record enough information to permit an abort. (This is arguably a bug in git, but it’s merely an annoyance, and not something normal people are going to encounter.)</p>
<pre>git reset --hard
</pre>
<p>The problem is that octopus merges work only if there are no conflicts. We’re going to have to build our own octopus merge.</p>
<pre>cat dairy fruits veggies | sort &gt;food
git rm dairy fruits veggies
git add food
git write-tree
</pre>
<p>The <code>git write-tree</code> creates a tree from the index. It’s the tree that a <code>git commit</code> would create, but we don’t want to do a normal commit. This is the tree we want to commit, but we need to set custom parents, so we’ll ask <code>git write-tree</code> for the tree that <i>would be committed</i>, so we can build our custom commit.</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">git commit-tree 〈tree-hash〉 -p HEAD -p d2f -p f2f -p v2f -m "combine dairy, fruits, and veggies"
</pre>
<p>The <code>commit-tree</code> will print another hash. This is the hash of the manually-constructed octopus merge.</p>
<pre>git merge --ff-only 〈commit-hash〉
</pre>
<p>I like to use <code>--ff-only</code> to make sure that I really am just moving forward.</p>
<pre>git blame food

03c4572c veggies (Bob   2019-05-15 07:00:01 -0700 9) peas
</pre>
<p>There are other ways we could have produced the same result. For example, we could have performed a series of two-files-into-one merges, but this way gives us a single commit on the trunk that captures the “combine multiple files into one”.</p>
