<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Things I've written that have amused other people, Episode 4</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues pointed out that my web site is listed in the references section of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/DLL_bestprac.mspx"> this whitepaper</a>. It scares me that I’m being used as formal documentation because that is explicitly what this web site isn’t. I wrote back,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I really need to put a disclaimer on my web site. </p>
<blockquote><p> FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY </p></blockquote>

<p> Remember, this is a blog. The opinions (and even some facts) expressed here are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Microsoft Corporation. Nothing I write here creates an obligation on Microsoft or establishes the company’s official position on anything. I am not a spokesperson. I’m just this guy who strings people along in the hopes that they might hear a funny story once in a while.</p>
<p> You’d think this was obvious, but apparently there are people who think that somehow <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/08/1035971.aspx#1041611"> what I write has the weight of official Microsoft policy and take my sentences apart as if they were legal documents</a> or who take my articles and declare them to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#_ref-TechNet_on_FAT32_1"> official statements from Microsoft Corporation</a>. </p>
