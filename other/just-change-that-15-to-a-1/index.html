It would be nice and easy to just change that 15 to a 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
If only it were that simple.
</p>
<p>
In the case described in that article, it’s not that a single
operation was attempted fifteen times in a loop.
Rather, the fifteen operations were scattered all over the program.
Suppose, for example, that the network operation was
“Get the attributes of this file.”
The program might be filling in a file listing with several
columns, one for the icon, another for the file name,
another for the file author, and the last one for the last-modified time.
</p>
<pre>
for each filename in directory {
 list.Add(new ListElement(filename));
}
</pre>
<p>
Well, that doesn’t access the same file fifteen times.
Oh wait, there’s more.
What happens when it comes time to draw that list element?
</p>
<pre>
ListElement::DrawIcon()
{
 if (m_whichIcon == don't know)
 {
  m_whichIcon = GetIcon(m_filename);
 }
 draw the icon for the element
}
// with this common helper function
GetIcon(filename)
{
 if (filename is a directory) {
  return FolderIcon;
 } else {
  return PieceOfPaper;
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, getting the icon accesses the file once.
You can imagine a similar exercise for getting the file’s
last-modified time.
What else?
</p>
<pre>
ListElement::GetAuthor()
{
 if (m_author == don't know) {
  AuthorProvider = LoadAuthorProvider();
  m_author = AuthorProvider-&gt;GetFileAuthor(m_filename);
 }
 return m_author;
}
// where the author provider is implemented in a
// separate component
GetFileAuthor(filename)
{
 if (filename is offline) {
  return "";
 } else {
  ... open the file and get the author ...
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Getting the author accesses the file once to see if it
is offline, then again to get the actual author (if the
file is online).
</p>
<p>
So in this simple sketch, we accessed the file a total
of five times.
It’s not like there’s a 5 in this program you can change to a 1.
Rather, it’s a bunch of 1’s spread all over the place.
(And one of the 1’s is in a separate component,
the hypothetical Author Provider.)

It reminds of a story I may have read in
John Gall’s
<i><a href="http://www.generalsystemantics.com/Systemantics.htm">Systemantics</a></i>:
There was a server product that was
having problems under load.
Once there were more than thirty simultaneous users,
the system slowed to a crawl,
but the customer needed to support fifty users.
At a meeting convened to discuss this problem,
an engineer joked,
“Well, we just have to search the source code for
the <code>#define</code> that says thirty and change it to fifty.”
</p>
<p>
All the people at the meeting laughed, except one,
who earnestly asked, “Yeah, so why don’t we do that?”</p>
