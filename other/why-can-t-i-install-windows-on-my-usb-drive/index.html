<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I install Windows on my USB drive?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A collection of limitations (both hardware and software)  currently prevent Windows from booting and running off a USB drive.  Some of them are described in  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/bus/usb/usb-boot.mspx">  this whitepaper from WinHEC 2003</a>.  Another reason not mentioned in this paper is that during any hot-plug  operation, the USB bus is completely reinitialized.  Windows really doesn’t like it when it loses access to its boot device.  Imagine, you plug in a USB camera, the USB bus reinitializes, Windows  loses access to the boot drive, and <em>oops</em> the kernel needs to page in  some data and it can’t.
  Rats.</p>
<p>  But who knows, someday maybe it will work.  </p>
