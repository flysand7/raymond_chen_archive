<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A sense of the term anonymous with which I had previously been unfamiliar</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was filling out one of those online <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/02/10/9960892.aspx"> satisfaction surveys</a>, and in the introduction, it reassured me that</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> This survey is anonymous. </p></blockquote>
<p> The first question on the survey:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Enter the support request (SR) number below. </p></blockquote>
<p> Yeah, because they’ll never be able to trace the support request number back to me.</p>
<p> (I suspect that the reason for this contradiction is that the organization that wanted to conduct the survey used a site that supports either anonymous surveys or tracked surveys, and they opted for the anonymous survey for whatever reason—maybe it’s cheaper?—but they actually wanted a tracked survey, so they made the tracking number part of the survey itself.) </p>
