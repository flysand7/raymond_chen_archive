<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Alt text for images are important in email, too</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Apparently the IT department gave up on
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/09/9710985.aspx">
getting everybody to read email in plain text</a>,
and other service departments at Microsoft have moved beyond
simply using HTML for markup
and started adding banner images to the top of each email message.
Because the best way to promote your brand to other parts
of the company is to stick a banner logo at the top of every message.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the HTML for one such banner image,
with line breaks inserted for sanity.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;img width=707 height=63 id="Picture_x0020_2"
src="cid:image001.png@01CB0944.B4771400"
alt="Description: Description: Description: Description:
Description: Description: Description: Microsoft Real Estate
and Facilities"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The great thing about the absurd alt text is that
that’s what appears in the autopreview window
and in the email notification pop-up.
</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td style="background: infobackground;color: infotext">
<b>BUILDING NOTICE: Buildings 8…</b><br/>
    Description: Description: Description:<br/>
    Description: Description: Description:…
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
But wait, it gets worse.
The second image in the message (a giant
<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle-information.svg">
circled-i</a> icon indicating that this is an informational message)
has as its alt text
<code>"Description: Description: Description: Description: Description:
Description: cid:image003.jpg@01CAFC55.BC923A80"</code>.
Yeah, like that explains the image clearly.
</p>
<p>
Maybe they were just
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE">
taking a lead from the boss</a>.
</p>
<p>
No lesson today, just venting.</p>
