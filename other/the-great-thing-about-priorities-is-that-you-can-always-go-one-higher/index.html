<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The great thing about priorities is that you can always go one higher</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The phenomenon I call <i>priority inflation</i> has spread to product planning documents as well. Back in the old days, there were three priority levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority 1: <i>must have</i>. If you don’t accomplish a priority 1 item, you may as well just cancel the project because it ain’t shipping. </li>
<li>Priority 2: <i>should have</i>. If you don’t accomplish a priority 2 item, the product is significantly weaker, but you can still ship it. </li>
<li>Priority 3: <i>nice to have</i>. If you don’t accomplish a priority 3 item, it’s not quite as awesome as it could have been, but it’s still a good product. </li>
</ul>
<p> Over the past few years, I’ve seen a shift in the labelling of priorities in planning documents. A new priority has been introduced: <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/techtracks/"> <i>Priority Zero</i></a>. Nobody has explained to me what <i>Priority 0</i> means, but I assume somebody invented it to emphasize that the feature is <i>even more critical than priority 1</i>. Mind you, I’m not sure what could be more important to a project than “If we don’t do this, we’re all fired.” Maybe “If we don’t do this, the earth will explode.” </p>
<p> As you might expect, priority inflation has a trickle-down effect. People whose features had been assigned priority 1 said, “Hey, how come my feature isn’t priority 0? It’s just as critical as that other guy’s feature.” Soon, everything that was priority 1 got reclassified as priority 0. Nature abhors a vacuum, so all the priority 2 items got reclassified as priority 1, and the priority 3 items got reclassified as priority 2. </p>
<p> In the end, nothing changed aside from the names on the buckets. It’s been years since I’ve seen a planning document with any priority 3 items. It’s all zero, one, and two now. </p>
<p> Wait, I lied. The meaning of the last bucket (the former priority 3, now named priority 2) has changed. It used to be things that would be <i>nice to have</i>, but now it appears to be used for <i>something other people suggested which I didn’t think was important, but I didn’t want to be mean and reject it outright, so I’m listing it here to make those people feel better and showing that their “voice was heard,” but don’t kid yourself; we’re not going to do it</i>. In other words, priority 2 means <i>No</i>. </p>
<p> I give it three years before somebody decides that an issue is even more critical than priority 0 and labels it <i>Priority −1</i>. </p>
<p> <b>Epilogue</b>: After I originally wrote this entry, I’ve learned that some teams have indeed come up with a priority level even more important than Priority 0. It’s called Priority <i>Now</i>. </p>
