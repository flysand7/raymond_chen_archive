<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Essays from the funniest man in Microsoft Research</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>James Mickens has written a number of essays for <i>;login:</i> magazine. The wall-of-text presentation is kind of scary, and the first time I encountered them, I skimmed the essays rather than reading them through. As a result, my reaction was, “I got tired.” But if you follow the path and read the essays through, you realize that they are all brilliant.</p>

<blockquote class="q"><p> When researchers talk about mobile computers, they use visionary, exciting terms like “fast”, “scalable”, and “this solution will definitely work in practice.” </p></blockquote>

<p> One of my colleagues found the stash of columns in the “Miscellaneous Excellence” section on <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/"> Mickens’ Web site</a> and reacted with “This is better than getting free cookies.”
 Here’s <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2012/01/24/james-mickens-the-funniest-man-in-microsoft-research.aspx"> an interview with “the funniest man in Microsoft Research”</a>.
 I would have done this for <i>TechNet Magazine</i> if I had known this was possible.
 Also if I had the talent.
 Mostly the talent part.</p>
