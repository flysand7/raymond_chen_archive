An earlier name for
Windows Server 2003 was Microsoft Windows .NET Server,
and in the final weeks leading up the the product’s release,
we received the following bug from a beta tester:
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
When I call the <code>GetVersionEx</code> function on
build 3773, the OS name is still reported as
“Microsoft Windows .NET Enterprise Server”.
I have attached a sample program illustrating the bug.
</blockquote>
<p>
I found this kind of confusing, because the <code>GetVersionEx</code>
function doesn’t return a human-readable product name.
Intriguged, I took a look at the sample program and it wasn’t too hard to
see where the bug was.
The program contained the lines
</p>
<pre>
if ( osvi.dwMajorVersion == 5 &amp;&amp; osvi.dwMinorVersion == 2 )
   lstrcpyn(szOS, L”Microsoft Windows .NET”, MAX_PATH);
</pre>
<p>
In other words, the program had the incorrect string
hard-coded into it.
</p>
<p>
I reported my findings back to the person who submitted the bug,
and the response was “Oops, sorry about that.”
</p></p>
