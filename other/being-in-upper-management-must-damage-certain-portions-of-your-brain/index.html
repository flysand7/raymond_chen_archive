<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Being in upper management must damage certain portions of your brain</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  The air must be thinner the higher up the management chain you go,  or maybe it just gives you more opportunities to look stupid.  Like this message:  </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b>From</b>: &lt;some upper manager&gt;<br/> <b>Subject</b>: &lt;some subject&gt;  </p>
<p>  I will try to keep this relatively brief as I know how busy everyone is.  </p>
<p>  &lt;… 4-page message follows…&gt;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  If this is brief, I’d hate to see a “somewhat lengthy” message.  </p>
