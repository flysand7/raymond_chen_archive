<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The shift key overrides NumLock</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Perhaps not as well-known today as it was in the days when <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/kb/layout/stdXT83-c.html"> the arrow keys and numeric keypad shared space</a> is that the shift key overrides NumLock.</p>
<p> If NumLock is on (as it usually is), then pressing a key on the numeric keypad while holding the shift key overrides NumLock and instead generates the arrow key (or other navigation key) printed in small print under the big digits. </p>
<p> (The shift key also overrides CapsLock. If you turn on CapsLock then hold the shift key while typing a letter, that letter comes out in lowercase.) </p>
<p> Perhaps you might decide that this little shift key quirk is completely insignificant, at least until you try to do something like assign Shift+Numpad0 as a hotkey and wonder why it doesn’t work. Now you know. </p>
