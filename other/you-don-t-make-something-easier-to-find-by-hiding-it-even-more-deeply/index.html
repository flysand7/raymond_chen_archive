<p>Commenter rolfhub suggested that, to help people recover from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/30/103379.aspx"> accidentally going into Tiny Footprint Mode</a>, the Task Manager could <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/25/4036123.aspx#4143739"> display a right-click context menu with an entry to return to normal mode</a>.
 My initial reaction to this was Huh? Who right-clicks on <i>nothing</i>? Tiny Footprint Mode is itself already a bad secret hidden setting. Having the exit from the mode be a right-click menu on a blank space is a <i>double-secret hidden setting</i>.</p>
<p> If I had <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/29/9986468.aspx#9987023"> dictatorial control over all aspects of the shell</a>, I would put a Restore button  <font face="Marlett" style="border: solid .75pt black"><!--[if IE]&gt;2&lt;![endif]--></font> in the upper right corner to let people return to normal mode. </p>
