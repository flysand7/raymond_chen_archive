<p>During the development of Windows 95, a placeholder dialog  was added with the title,  “In order to demonstrate our superior intellect,  we will now ask you a question you cannot answer.”  The dialog itself asked a technical question  that you need  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/marvin.shtml">  a brain the size of a planet</a>  in order to answer.  (Okay, your brain didn’t need to be quite that big.)
  Of course, there was no intention of shipping Windows 95 with such  a dialog.  The dialog was there only until other infrastructure became available,  permitting the system to answer the question automatically.
  But when I saw that dialog, I was enlightened.  As programmers, we often find ourselves unsure what to do next,  and we say,  “Well, to play it safe,  <a href="http://mikepope.com/blog/DisplayBlog.aspx?permalink=485">  I’ll just ask the user what they want to do</a>.  I’m sure they’ll make the right decision.”
  Except that they don’t.  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/01/54734.aspx">  The default answer to every dialog box is Cancel</a>.  If you ask the user a technical question, odds are they they’re  just going to stare at it blankly for a while, then  try to cancel out of it.  The lesson they’ve learned is  “Computers are hard to use.”
  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html">  Even Eric Raymond has discovered this</a>.  (Don’t forget to read his  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/luxury-part-deux.html">follow-up</a>.)</p>
<p>  So don’t ask questions the user can’t answer.  It doesn’t get you anywhere and it just frustrates the user.  </p>
