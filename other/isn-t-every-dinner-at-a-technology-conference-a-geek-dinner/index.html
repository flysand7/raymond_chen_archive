<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Isn't every dinner at a technology conference a geek dinner?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I’m always amused when somebody announces that <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/geek-dinner-at-tech-ed/"> they’re having a geek dinner at a technology conference</a>. I mean, at a conference like that, <i>every</i> dinner is a geek dinner. The geek density is so high, +4 enchanted vorpal swords quiver in fear. </p>
