<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you're looking for the code that displays a particular dialog box, the most directly way to find it is to look for the dialog box</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Suppose you are working in a large or unfamiliar code base and you want to know where the code is that displays a particular dialog box or message box or something. Probably the most direct way of figuring this out is to look for the strings.
 Say there is a message box that asks for user confirmation. “Are you sure you want to frobulate the flux capacitor?” Search for that string in your source code. It will probably be in a resource file.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <code> resource.rc:IDS_CONFIRM­FROBULATE "<u>Are you sure you want to frobulate the flux capacitor</u>?" </code> </p></blockquote>
<p> Great, now you have the string ID for that message. You can perform a second search for that ID.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <code> resource.h:#define <u>IDS_CONFIRM­FROBULATE</u> 1024<br/> resource.rc:<u>IDS_CONFIRM­FROBULATE</u> "Are you sure you want to frobulate the flux capacitor?"<br/> maintenance.cpp:   strPrompt.LoadString(<u>IDS_CONFIRM­FROBULATE</u>); </code> </p></blockquote>
<p> If the thing you are searching for is a dialog box or menu item, then be aware that there may be an accelerator in the string, so a straight grep won’t find it.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <code> No matches for "Enter the new name of the frobulator:" </code> </p></blockquote>
<p> For a dialog box, you can tap the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key to make the accelerator show up, so you can search for the right string. For a menu, you invoke the menu via the keyboard. Or in either case, you can disable the <i>Hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation</i> setting.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <code> resource.rc:  LTEXT "<u>Enter the ne&amp;w name of the frobulator</u>:", </code> </p></blockquote>
<p> I tend to be lazy and instead of using any of those tricks to make the underlines show up, I just search for a shorter string and hope that the accelerator isn’t in it.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <code> resource.rc:  LTEXT "Enter the ne&amp;w <u>name of the frobulator</u>:", </code> </p></blockquote>
<p> “But Raymond, hitting the <kbd>Alt</kbd> is just a quick tap on the keyboard. Surely you can’t be <i>that</i> lazy!”
 Right. If the dialog box were right in front of me, then I could tap the <kbd>Alt</kbd> and be done. But usually, when I am investigating this sort of thing, it’s because somebody has sent a screen shot and asks, “Where is the code that displays this?” Tapping <kbd>Alt</kbd> on a screen shot doesn’t usually get you very far.</p>
<p> Once you find the code that displays the dialog box or message box or whatever, you can then study the code to answer follow-up questions like “What are the conditions under which this dialog will appear?” or “Is there a setting to suppress this dialog?” </p>
