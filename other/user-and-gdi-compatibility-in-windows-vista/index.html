<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">USER and GDI compatibility in Windows Vista</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My colleague <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/"> Nick Kramer</a> who works over on WPF has the first of what will be a series of articles on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/archive/2006/04/04/567769.aspx"> USER and GDI compatibility in Windows Vista</a>. The changes to tighten security, improve support for East Asian languages, and take the desktop to a new level with the Desktop Window Manager (among others) make for quite an interesting compatibility risk list.
 And since I mentioned the DWM, you would do well to check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/"> Greg Schechter</a> who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/03/25/561167.aspx"> has been writing about the Desktop Window Manager</a>, how it works, how it fits into the rest of the system, all that stuff. I know some people have been posting comments asking for information about the DWM. You would be much better served asking Greg since he actually works on it, whereas all I know about the DWM is how to spell it.</p>
