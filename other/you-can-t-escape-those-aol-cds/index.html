<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can't escape those AOL CDs</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues was unpacking one of those $30,000 quad-processor more-memory-than-you-know-what-to-do-with super-server computers. The kind that require their own electrical substation.
 And it came with an AOL CD.
 It’s like buying a Lexus and finding a 35-cents-off coupon in the glove compartment.
 Apparently, one of the questions AOL tech support asks when people call in complaining that they can’t get their AOL CD to work is, “<a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2004/nov/041113.waitwait.html">Do you have a computer?</a>” [Opening Panel Round, second question] because so many people who don’t have computers stick the CD into their stereo or DVD player and can’t get it to work.</p>
