<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Operations jargon: Internet egress</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As I’ve noted before, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/08/10172338.aspx"> the operations team has their own jargon which superficially resembles English</a>. Some time ago, they sent out a message with the subject <i>A New Internet Egress Path Is Coming</i>.
 Translation: We’re changing the way computers access the Internet.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus jargon</b>: <i>traffic on the edge</i>. This does not refer to traffic that is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. It merely refers to traffic that crosses the boundary between intranet and Internet. </p>
