<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Pranksters breathe a sigh of relief: There will never be a Building 7</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It is a longstanding prank at Microsoft’s main Redmond campus to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2003/03/15/3872.aspx"> send an unsuspecting new employee to building 7</a> under the pretense of having a meeting or needing to pick up something. There is no such building on the main Microsoft campus. This nonexistent building has also been used as a sort of inside joke. For example, if somebody invites you to <a href="http://www.randyrants.com/2006/02/you_have_a_meet.html"> a meeting in Building 7</a>, they’re probably inviting you off campus to take a break from work.
 A few years ago, there was a vacancy in a small business park a very short walk from the main Microsoft campus. (You don’t even have to cross the street to get there.) I thought it would be great if somebody leased the space and opened a bar called <i>Building 7</i>. It could have a back room decorated like a Microsoft meeting room, complete with WiFi and a large monitor. Then somebody could legitimately invite you to a meeting in Building 7, and people could use it as a cover story: “Sorry, I’m going to be working late tonight. Team meeting in Building 7.”
 The announcement in February 2006 of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/feb06/02-09CampusExpand.mspx"> a major expansion of the main Redmond campus</a> came with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/images/press/2006/02-09campus-map_med.jpg"> a little map</a>, and people with way too much time on their hands pored over the unreadably tiny print on the map and noticed a little <i>7</i> printed on the orange building in the upper right corner. They quietly fretted that a piece of Microsoft history was vanishing and that they’ll have to come up with a new prank to play on the new-hires.</p>
<p> In June 2007, pranksters (and people with a nostalgic streak) breathed a sigh of relief. The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/30/7315956.aspx"> real estate department</a> announced that the new building tentatively labelled <i>7</i> on the map will now be known as Building 37. In deference to Microsoft tradition, the name <i>Building 7</i> has been officially retired. There will never be a Building 7. </p>
