<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Some senior executives are afraid to provide feedback, because they know that their feedback will be given too much weight</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I recall a conversation I had with Steve Sinofsky, back when he was in charge of Windows. As you might expect, he gets to see early versions of a lot of things, his laptop is running <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">dogfood</a> everything, and everybody is asking for feedback. </p>
<p>And he rarely gives any.¹ </p>
<p>Not because he’s a jerk, but because he understands that if he provides any feedback, it will get magnified <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140715-00/?p=503">from an idea to a suggestion to a recommendation to a direct order</a>.² </p>
<p>“Why isn’t there a Frobnicate button right next to the Widget? The main reason I go to that page is to find a Widget to frobnicate.” </p>
<p>This becomes “Steve wants to add a Frobnicate button right next to the Widget”, and then “Steve says we have to add a Frobnicate button right next to the Widget”. </p>
<p>I guess, if he is moved to make a suggestion or share an idea, he can mention it to somebody and add “Tell the XYZ team, but don’t tell them it came from me.” I don’t know if that’s what he actually does. </p>
<p>¹ Presumably he gives feedback on the functionality as a whole, but today I’m talking about feedback on the level of feature requests or tweaks, like how the UI should be laid out, or the order of the pages in a wizard, or whether a wizard should be used at all. </p>
<p>² I hesitate to mention that at the time Exchange was being developed, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> standard <i>did not yet exist</i>. Try it: Fire up your archived copy of Windows 95, launch Notepad or Wordpad or whatever, and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. Nothing happens. At the time, the standard hotkey for Find was <kbd>F3</kbd>. (And, in fact, many applications today still accept <kbd>F3</kbd> as a shortcut for Find.) </p>
