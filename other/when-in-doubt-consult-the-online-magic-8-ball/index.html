<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When in doubt, consult the online Magic 8 Ball</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On our team’s web site, buried among the other debugging documents, was a page titled simply “Magic 8 Ball”®¹. If you visited it, you got a dark blue circle with a lighter-blue triangle, on which appeared white text with a randomly-chosen message. The messages were things like</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory corruption. </li>
<li>Try a newer build. </li>
<li>Known bug. </li>
<li>Can’t connect. </li>
<li>Hardware failure. </li>
<li>Looks like a X bug. (Where “X” was a random component.) </li>
</ul>
<p> It was fun to give the 8-ball a shake, but the real purpose of the 8-ball was to be a link sent out in response to failure reports.
 You see, there was a secret URL for each of the 8-ball’s responses, so you could respond to a failure report with something like</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The Magic 8 ball says…  http://internalserver/magic8.asp?TWVGS </p></blockquote>
<p> and when the person clicked on the link, they got an 8-ball that said “Known bug” or “Memory corruption”.
 Some teams liked the 8-Ball’s responses so much, they asked us to add new custom messages to the repertoire.
 Anyway, I was reminded of this by <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6118099"> the story of Radio8Ball</a>.</p>
<p> ¹Magic 8-Ball is a registered trademark of Tyco Toys, Inc. When the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2584675.stm"> Tyco scandal</a> hit the airwaves, I always did a double-take before realizing that it was a different company. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tyco International = scandal-plagued multinational conglomerate,     cursed by shareholders. </li>
<li>Tyco Toys = a division of Mattel, maker of the Magic 8 Ball,     beloved by soothsayers. </li>
</ul>
