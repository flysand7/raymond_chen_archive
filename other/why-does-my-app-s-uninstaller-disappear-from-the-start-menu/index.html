<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does my app’s uninstaller disappear from the Start menu?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported that their installer creates a shortcut on the Start menu called <i>Uninstall Contoso Deluxe</i>, but a few seconds after their installer completes, the <i>Uninstall Contoso Deluxe</i> icon disappears from the Start menu. The main <i>Contoso Deluxe</i> shortcut is still there. What’s going on? </p>
<p>The uninstaller shortcut is removed from the Start menu to reduce clutter. You can uninstall apps from the <i>Apps</i> page in <i>Settings</i>, or from the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel (formerly known as <i>Add or Remove Programs</i>). You can also get to the uninstaller by right-clicking <i>Contoso Deluxe</i> and selecting <i>Uninstall</i>. </p>
<p>Adding an uninstaller icon to Start menu is triply redundant, and it puts uninstallers in a high-traffic area of the user interface, when users are mostly looking for apps to run, not apps to uninstall. </p>
<p>The uninstaller shortcut is still there, so your uninstaller won’t get confused when it tries to delete the uninstaller shortcut. But the Start menu doesn’t show it. </p>
