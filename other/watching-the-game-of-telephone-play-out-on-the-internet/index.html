<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Watching the game of “Telephone” play out on the Internet</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Let’s see if I can get this straight.</p>
<p> First, <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo</a> says (timecode 37:59) he’s not entirely pleased with the word “podcast” in <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/11"> Episode 11 of This Week in Tech</a>. The Seattle-PI then reports that <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/231986_theinsider11.html"> the sentiment is shared with “several Microsoft employees” who have coined the word “blogcast” to replace it</a>. Next, <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10805_3-5790644.html"> c|net picks up the story</a> and says that the word “podcast” is a “faux-pas” on Microsoft campus. [Typo fixed: 9am] </p>
<p> In this manner, a remark by someone who isn’t even a Microsoft employee becomes, through rumor, speculation, and wild extrapolation, a word-ban at Microsoft. </p>
<p> Pretty neat trick. </p>
