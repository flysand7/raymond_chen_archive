<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does this strange value for “Percent CPU” mean in Performance Monitor?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was monitoring the CPU usage of one of their processes in the Performance Monitor tool, and they got a pretty graph and this summary: </p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td colspan="6" style="padding-bottom: 1ex">Average: <span style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1px">  271,828</span>   Minimum: <span style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1px">    0,000</span>   Maximum: <span style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1px"> 3.141,592</span> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Scale</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Counter</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Instance</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Parent</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Object</td>
<td style="border: solid 1px gray">Computer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black;border-left: solid 1px black">0,1</td>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black">% Processor Time</td>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black">myapp</td>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black">—</td>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black">Process</td>
<td style="border-bottom: solid 1px black;border-right: solid 1px black">\\MYPC</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>What did the process consume 271828 of? What does this number mean in the context of percent processor time? </p>
<p>FIrst thing to notice is that the comma is a decimal separator, not a thousands separator. You see a clue there in the <i>Scale</i> column, where it says “0,1”. Also in the <i>Maximum</i>, where it says “3.141,592”, where the period after the “3” makes no sense if the comma were a decimal separator. Nope, this information is displayed according to a locale where the comma is the decimal separator and the period is the thousands separator. </p>
<p>Okay, so that unwraps one layer of the onion. We were misreading the value. It’s actually 271.828. But 271.828 what? </p>
<p>The next clue is that <i>Scale</i>. It is set to 0.1, which means that the displayed value is tenths of a unit. So you didn’t consume 271.828 units, but rather 271.828 tenths of a unit, or 27.1828 units. </p>
<p>The next clue is that the value itself is called <i>% Processor Time</i>, which tells you that that it is reporting in percentage of processor time. </p>
<p>Therefore, this process consumed 27% of a processor on average during the period under measurement. The maximum was 3141.592 × 0.1 = 314.1592 percent of a processor. In other words, during its peak, the process used the equivalent of 3.14 processors. (One can infer, then, that this system has at least four processors.) </p>
<p>To get to the final answer, we had to go through three layers: </p>
<ol>
<li>Parse the value correctly.</li>
<li>Adjust for the scale factor.</li>
<li>Interpret the value as a percentage.</li>
</ol>
