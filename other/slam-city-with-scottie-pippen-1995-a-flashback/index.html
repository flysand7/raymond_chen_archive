<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Slam City with Scottie Pippen (1995): A flashback</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>For some reason, I was reminded of this game. </p>
<p>It appears from <a href="http://semajblogeater.blogspot.com/2014/07/slam-city-with-scottie-pippen-holy-crap.html">all</a> <a href="http://www.sega-16.com/2012/11/slam-city-with-scotty-pippen/">reports</a> that the SEGA version of this game sucked. </p>
<p>Well, the PC version sucked too. </p>
<p>It was basically a port of <a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/#Computer Games">some game from <i>Creative Computing</i></a>. </p>
<pre>
You have the ball. You can

1. Drive left
2. Drive right
3. Shoot

Your choice ?
</pre>
<p>Your player was represented as a sprite of a photograph of a basketball player, and if you said “3”, for example, the sprite moved up, then back down, and then you learned whether the ball went in. At least that’s how I remember it. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=slam%20city%20with%20scottie%20pippen">This phenomenal gameplay</a> was supported by four CDs. </p>
<p>Oh, and the goal of the game was not to score more points than your opponent. That would be too easy. The goal of the game is to earn “respect”, so that you could someday play against the Big Boss: Scottie Pippen. </p>
<p>I had to figure out why the opening title sequence of the game didn’t work on Windows 95. </p>
<p>I don’t think I solved that one. The opening title sequence never worked on Windows 95, at least not without using MS-DOS mode. I console myself by thinking that removing the title sequence was an improvement. It meant that you would waste less time playing this stupid game. </p>
