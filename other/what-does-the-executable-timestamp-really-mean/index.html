<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the executable timestamp really mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was looking for some information on the executable timestamp:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I would like my program to display the date it was linked. The <code>IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.Time­Date­Stamp</code> looks like what I need. Is there an easy way to retrieve this information so I don’t have to parse the EXE header myself? Also, what functions exist for formatting this timestamp into something human-readable? </p></blockquote>
<p> The customer didn’t explain why they needed this information, but presumably it was for diagnostic purposes. For example, the program might display the information in the <i>About</i> box to help the product support team identify which version of the program the end-user is running.
 We’ll answer the questions in reverse order, and then answer a question that wasn’t even asked.
 The timestamp is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/05/54806.aspx"> a Unix-style <code>time_t</code> timestamp</a>; therefore, you can use the <code>ctime</code> function to convert it to text. If there is a particular format you like, you can use the appropriate time formatting function (though you may have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2003/07/30/50205.aspx"> convert it first</a>).
 If you want to retrieve this value, you can use <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2007/01/18/timestamps.aspx"> helper functions in the <code>imagehlp</code> library</a>; the one most applicable here appears to be <code>Image­Nt­Header</code> or even <code>Get­Time­stamp­For­Loaded­Library</code>.</p>
<p> The unasked question is “Does this in fact give me the date and time that the image was linked?” Fortunately, I don’t have to write out the answer to this question, because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/18/9980802.aspx"> I answered it last year</a>. The name <i>timestamp</i> is misleading. Its real purpose is to act as a signature so that the operating system can determine whether a DLL against which one set of values was precalculated matches the DLL physically on the system. A better name for it would have been <code>UniqueId</code>. </p>
