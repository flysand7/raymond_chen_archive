<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why did Raymond bring a knitting bag to every meeting?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I stopped knitting a few years ago, but back when I knitted regularly, I tended to bring my knitting bag with me everywhere I went.
 There are a lot of idle minutes in your typical day. Waiting for the bus, waiting in line for the ATM, waiting for a meeting to start. There’s not enough time in those idle minutes to do anything substantial, but it’s enough time to sneak in a little bit of knitting.
 But there’s another reason I brought a knitting bag to every meeting.</p>
<p> Nothing says “I don’t care about this meeting” like knitting. </p>
