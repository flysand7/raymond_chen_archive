<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">@-notation was never legal in HTTP URLs anyway</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Some people are in an uproar over IE’s
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=834489">
dropping of support for @ notation in HTTP URLs</a>.
What people fail to note is that
The @ notation <strong>was never legal for HTTP URLs in the
first place</strong>.
If you go to
<a href="http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1738/14.htm">
RFC 1738 section 3.3 (HTTP)</a>,
it explicitly states:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
   An HTTP URL takes the form:</p>
<p><pre>
      http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;searchpart&gt;
</pre>
<p>
   where &lt;host&gt; and &lt;port&gt; are as described in Section 3.1.
   If :&lt;port&gt;
   is omitted, the port defaults to 80.
   <strong>No user name or password is
   allowed.</strong>
</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
(Emphasis mine.)
</p>
<p>
So there are now three sides to the argument:
</p>
<ul>
<li>“I want Internet Explorer to be backwards-compatible with my invalid URLs.”
    (These people want the @-syntax retained.)
<li>“I want Internet Explorer to be more secure.”
    (These people want the @-syntax removed.)
<li>“I want Internet Explorer to be more standards-compliant.”
    (These people also want the @-syntax removed.)
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Personally I think dropping support for @-notation was the
right thing to do.
