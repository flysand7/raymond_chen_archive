<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Apparently I've been promoted by mistake all these years</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070322063412/http://blogs.msdn.com/devi/archive/2006/08/07/691791.aspx"> this posting on the secret to getting promoted</a> caught my eye.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> After several years at Microsoft, I had an epiphany today. I came to the realization that the best way, rather the only way — to get promoted is to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain top talent. Other factors do go a long way but without the ability to hire, you are going to reach your glass ceiling sooner than you think. </p></blockquote>
<p> I have done absolutely nothing to demonstrate this ability, and if I managed to hire or retain anybody, it was purely by accident and for that I apologize.
 As far as I’m aware, I’ve never done anything listed in the article as “the only way” to get promoted. I must have been promoted by mistake. (And I suspect <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft</a> might have a thing or two to say to the claim that the only way to get a promotion at Microsoft is to hire, hire, hire.)
 Yes, I know that the phrase “the only way” was written for rhetorical effect and is not to be taken literally. I’m making a joke, people!
 And as it so happens, I also took the text out of context. The target audience for the remarks was senior management, not dorky programmer types like me. So, strike two.
 <b>Aftermath</b>: After reading this entry <a href="http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=329"> in my “upcoming entries” blog queue</a> <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/02/16/yuvi-analyzes-raymond-chens-blog/#comment-292939"> accessible only to Microsoft employees</a>, a fellow employee emailed me to say that this Web site was a factor in deciding to come to Microsoft, so my claim that I have done absolutely nothing is incorrect. I wrote back, “Well, maybe so, but it’s also the case that I haven’t been promoted since you were hired.”</p>
<p> The response: “I guess I must not be top talent.” </p>
