<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On the adult appeal of dodgeball</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> NPR’s <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/"> Only a Game</a> recently covered the rise of <a href="http://realserver.bu.edu:8080/ramgen/w/b/wbur/oag/audio/2005/08/oag_0827.rm?start=25:56"> adult dodgeball</a>. At <a href="http://www.msn.com/">MSN</a>‘s <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/CommentView,guid,f3b46856-2fee-4ad8-a633-72b07b57ac02.aspx"> tenth birthday party</a> last week, there was a wide variety of entertainment options, the highlight of which appeared to be an organized dodgeball tournament. It was very well attended and didn’t have the ego-damaging overtones you got from elementary school. A good time was had by all. </p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/dcole/default.mspx"> Senior Vice President of MSN</a> happens also to have been the  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/24/455557.aspx"> development manager of Windows 95</a>, so he made the generous gesture of inviting the members of the Windows 95 team to his group’s birthday party. (Since the remaining members of the Windows 95 team are outnumbered forty-to-one by the current members of the MSN team, it gave the impression that Windows 95 was merely an after-thought to MSN! “Ten years ago, MSN 1.0 went live! And if I recall correctly, some little operating system rode our coattails.”) </p>
