<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Some internal developer chatter on a bug that caused your screen to turn black</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There was a bug in an internal build of Windows (let’s call it build <var>N</var>) where if you were sufficiently unlucky, your screen would turn black and get stuck that way. The team responsible for the bug was busy working on a fix. They later reported that verification in their branch was successful and that the fix was awaiting (but had not received) <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130820-00/?p=3453">fasttrack</a> approval for build <var>N</var> + 2. </p>
<p>The person who reported the problem asked, “So am I to assume that I shouldn’t install build <var>N</var>+1?” </p>
<p>The team dryly replied, “You should if you’re really into black.” </p>
