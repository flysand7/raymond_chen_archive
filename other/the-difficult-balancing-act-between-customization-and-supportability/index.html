<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The difficult balancing act between customization and supportability</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> My colleague <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/"> Kam VedBrat</a> (from who I shamelessly stole the pictures of thse high-DPI displays in my PDC talk) discusses <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/archive/2005/10/01/476160.aspx"> the difficult balancing act between customization and supportability</a>. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/archive/2005/10/02/476271.aspx">Part II</a>.) Note that decisions on this subject also also impact compatibility: Windows Vista greatly expands the palette of objects covered by the visual style. Any visual styles designed for Windows XP need to be revised in order to cover those new Windows Vista elements. Whose reponsibility would it be to revise them?</p>
