<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Technology hypochondriacs</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed quite a bit is something I’m going to call “technology hypochondria”, the belief that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/16/552821.aspx#552860"> you are suffering</a> from whatever problem <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/10/529525.aspx#529882"> you just read about</a>. It reminds me of this joke:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  A man goes to his doctor. “Doctor,” he says, “I’m pretty sure I’ve got this disease here. All the symptoms match. I’m suffering from fatigue, sleeplessness, irritability, and memory loss.” </p>
<p> “Mr. Jenkins,” the doctor responds, “I’m fairly certain you aren’t suffering from menopause.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One of my relatives who is a medical doctor in a public hospital explained to me that in his experience, you should never trust the diagnosis of a med student. “When we bring them along on rounds and show them a patient and ask them what they think the problem might be, they always answer with the disease they just studied last week.”
 When I describe one way a program can become unresponsive, that doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s why <strong>your</strong> program is unresponsive. A program can become unresponsive for any of a million reasons, most of which have the same basic symptoms: “When I click on the program, nothing happens.” That’s really not enough information from which to make a diagnosis. To make a diagnosis, you need to whack a debugger under the program and see why the UI thread isn’t processing messages. (<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2006/08/31/453100.aspx">Mark Russinovich did exactly that</a> to investigate a process startup delay he was experiencing, and the cause in his case was something I hadn’t seen before.)</p>
<p> If you post a comment to one of my articles asking, “Could this be why my program also has a similar problem?”, don’t expect much of an answer from me. It’s like writing a letter to a newspaper’s medical advice column saying, “I’m suffering from fatigue and loss of appetite. Do I have AIDS?” </p>
