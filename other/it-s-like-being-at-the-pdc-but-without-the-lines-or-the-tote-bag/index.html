<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It’s like being at the PDC, but without the lines or the tote bag</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/"> Michael Swanson</a> announced last night that the arduous process of assembling the PDC 2005 DVD content is now complete and the results <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/archive/2005/10/24/484434.aspx"> are now online</a>. For free. For six months. You can <a href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC05/"> choose a session</a> and watch it via streaming video, or you can download the video itself for offline enjoyment (!). Michael also has links to the order form if you want to have shiny silver DVDs in your grubby mitts. I’m told that the masters have been released to manufacturing; this means that shiny silver DVDs (including <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com"> Channel9 bonus tracks</a>) will probably be in the grubby mitts of attendees by (U.S.) Thanksgiving. But don’t quote me. </p>
<p> So go ahead, set up your own “virtual PDC”. Tote bag not included. </p>
