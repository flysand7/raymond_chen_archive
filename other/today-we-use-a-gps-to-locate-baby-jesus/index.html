<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Today, we use a GPS to locate Baby Jesus</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When Baby Jesus disappears from a Nativity scene, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008494011_baby11.html"> he might be wearing a tracking device</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> For two consecutive years, thieves made off with the baby Jesus figurine in Wellington, a town of 60,000 in Palm Beach County, Fla. The ceramic original, donated by a local merchant, was made in Italy and worth about $1,800…  </p>
<p> Last year, officials took a GPS unit normally used to track the application of mosquito spray and implanted it in the latest replacement figurine. After that one disappeared, sheriff’s deputies quickly tracked it down. </p>

<p> It’s sad that the world has come to this, but nice to know that technology is helping to make the world a slightly better place. </p>
