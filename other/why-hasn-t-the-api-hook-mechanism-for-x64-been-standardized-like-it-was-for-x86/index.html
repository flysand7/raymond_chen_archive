<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why hasn't the API hook mechanism for x64 been standardized like it was for x86?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Joshua posted to the Suggestion Box, “Around the time of WinXP SP2 x86, the API hook mechanism was standardized. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040389"> Why wasn’t the same thing done for x64</a>?”
 Who said it was standardized for x86?
 Hooking APIs is not supported by Windows. There may be specific interfaces that expose hooks (like <code>Co­Register­Initialize­Spy</code> to let you monitor calls to <code>CoInitialize</code> and <code>CoUninitialize</code>, and <code>Set­Windows­Hook­Ex</code> to let you hook various window manager operations) but there is no supported general API hooking mechanism provided by the operating system.</p>
<p> So I don’t know where you got that idea from. </p>
