<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway: Denial of service by high CPU usage</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We received the following security vulnerability report:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
Windows is vulnerable to a denial of service attack that consumes
100% CPU.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the following procedure to create a file
    that is enchanted by magic pixie dust:
    […]
<li>Rename the file to <code>TEST.EXE</code>.
<li>Execute as many copies of the program as you have CPU cores.
</li></li></li></ol>
<p>
Observe that CPU usage climbs to 100% and never goes down.
This a clear demonstration that Windows is vulnerable to
a denial of service attack from magic pixie dust.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The magic pixie dust is a red herring.
This vulnerability report is basically saying
“If you are allowed to run arbitrary programs,
then it is possible to run a program that
consumes all the available CPU.”
</p>
<p>
Well, duh.
</p>
<p>
This is another case of
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/07/4268706.aspx">
if I can run an arbitrary program, then I can do arbitrary things</a>,
also known as
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/07/4268706.aspx#4282521">
MS07-052: Code execution results in code execution</a>.
(Or
<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-y-is-x-redundant-adjectives-are-redundant">
in the lingo of Internet memes</a>,
“High CPU is high.”)
</p>
<p>
Now, of course, if the magic pixie dust somehow allows a user
to do things like access resources they do not have access to,
or to circumvent resource usage quotas,
then there would be a serious
problem here,
and if if the high CPU usage could be triggered remotely,
then there is a potential for a denial-of-service attack.
But there was nothing of the sort.
Here’s a much less complicated version of magic pixie dust:
</p>
<pre>
int __cdecl main(int, char **) { for (;;) { } /*NOTREACHED*/ }
</pre>
