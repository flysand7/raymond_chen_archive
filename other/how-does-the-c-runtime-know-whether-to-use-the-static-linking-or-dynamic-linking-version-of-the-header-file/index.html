<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does the C runtime know whether to use the static-linking or dynamic-linking version of the header file?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
In response to a description of what happens when you get
<code>dll­import</code> wrong,
nksingh asks,
“This seems like a problem for the CRT.
As far as I know,
VC gives you the option of statically or dynamically linking the CRT.
But it seems like the headers will have to make a choice to support
one thing better than the other.
Conditional compilation would work,
but then people would have to remember to include a #define somewhere.

Is this dllimport vs. static linking thing something the compiler could figure out on its own if you’re doing Link-time codegen</a>?”
</p>
<p>
Let’s start from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this would be a problem for the CRT since it wouldn’t know whether
to declare the functions as normal static functions or as
<code>dllimport</code>-style functions,
and the headers have to make a choice which way to go.
</p>
<p>
And if you look at the headers, you can see that it is indeed done
via conditional compilation.
</p>
<pre>
...
_CRTIMP int __cdecl fflush(FILE * _File);
...
</pre>
<p>
This magic <code>_CRTIMP</code> symbol is defined in
<code>crtdefs.h</code> like so:
</p>
<pre>
/* Define _CRTIMP */
#ifndef _CRTIMP
#ifdef _DLL
#define _CRTIMP __declspec(dllimport)
#else  /* _DLL */
#define _CRTIMP
#endif  /* _DLL */
#endif  /* _CRTIMP */
</pre>
<p>
Conditional compilation decides whether <code>_CRTIMP</code>
expands to <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> or to nothing at all,
depending on whether the <code>_DLL</code> symbol is defined.
</p>
<p>
And yet nobody bothers writing <code>#define _DLL</code> before
they <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>.
There must be something else going on.
</p>
<p>
In fact, we can run some experiments to see what’s going on.
</p>
<pre>
#ifdef _DLL
#error "_DLL is defined"
#else
#error "_DLL is not defined"
#endif
</pre>
<p>
Save this as <code>dummy.c</code> and run a few tests.
</p>
<pre>
C:\tests&gt; cl /MT dummy.c
dummy.c
dummy.c(4) : fatal error C1189: #error :  "_DLL is not defined"
C:\tests&gt; cl /MD dummy.c
dummy.c
dummy.c(2) : fatal error C1189: #error :  "_DLL is defined"
</pre>
<p>
Well how’s about that.
The compiler uses the <code>/MT</code> and <code>/MD</code>
flag to decide whether or not to define the preprocessor symbol
<code>_DLL</code>, which is the secret signal it passes to the
<code>crtdef.h</code> header file to control the conditional
compilation.
</p>
<p>
The compiler has to use this technique
instead of deferring the decision to link-time code generation
because it cannot assume that everybody has enabled link-time
code generation.
(Indeed, we explicitly did not in our sample command lines.)
</p>
<p>
If link-time code generation were enabled, then is this something
that could be deferred until that point?
</p>
<p>
In principle yes,
because link-time code generation in theory could just make the .obj
file a copy of the source file (and all the header files) and do
all the actual compiling at link time.
This is a sort of extreme way of doing it,
but I guess it could’ve been done that way.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it also means that the compiler folks would have
to come up with a new nonstandard extension that means “This function
might be a normal static function or it might be a
<code>dll­import</code>
function. I haven’t decided yet; I’ll tell you later.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing as how the CRT already has to solve the problem in the case
where there is no link-time code generation, it doesn’t seem worth
the effort to add a feature to link-time-code generation
that you don’t actually need.
It would be a feature for which the only client is the C runtime
library itself, for which the C runtime library already requires
a separate solution when link-time code generation is disabled,
and for which that separate solution <i>still works when link-time
code generation is enabled</i>.
</p>
<p>
No engineering purpose is served by
writing code just for the sake of writing code.</p>
