This happens to me, too.
I once got so distracted by the process of purchasing some tickets
in person,
choosing the performance date and the seats,
fumbling for my credit card,
signing the receipt, and when I was done, I left the ticket booth
without my tickets!

Here is a question that came in from a customer.
The details have been changed but the underlying point is the same.

<blockquote class="q">

According to the documentation, the
<code><a href="http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/howSlangwords.htm">taglog</a></code> command
prints a history log of all the tags in the system.
I can pass the <code>-d</code> option to limit the date range,
and that works too.
It also says that
that I can pass a specific tag name to limit the listing to just
that one tag,
but I can’t get that part to work.
Here’s what I’m doing:
</p>
<pre>
for /f %i in (taglist.txt) do taglog -d 2008/05/01,2008/05/31 &gt;&gt; output
</pre>
<p>
But this just dumps the history of all tags during the month of May,
not the tags I asked for.
</p>

<p>
This customer got so excited about passing the date range filter
that he forgot to pass the tag name.
