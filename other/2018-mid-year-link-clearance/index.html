<li>Bryan Gaw had been a member of Katy Perry’s dance team for five years     when he performed at the 2015 Super Bowl,     a dancer’s dream come true.     During the show, he changed out of a metallic horse costume into     a shark costume.     <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/31/my-dream-of-dancing-at-the-super-bowl-came-true-and-then-i-became-left-shark/">    He became Left Shark</a>. </li>

<li>I’ve     <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070910-01/?p=25193">    written about <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> before</a>.     I found this curiosity in one performance:     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRQw85LdRbI&amp;t=18m30s">    During this section, the woman in the blue jacket     plays the marimba from the wrong side</a>     because there aren’t enough marimbas,     so three musicians must share one instrument.     I asked one of my percussionist friends how hard this is.     “Like anything else, you get better with practice.     But (and I think this is what you’re after)     it’s not something you are normally taught,     any more than pianists are normally taught how to     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw2duffoqo">    play the piano from the wrong side</a>.” </li>
<li> <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/854756239397462016">    Love &amp; breadsticks: There was a knife fight at Olive Garden</a>.     <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeWadlington">Joe Wadlington</a>     went on a date with the former general manager of the Olive Garden     in Times Square.     It became an interview. </li>

<li>    The crazy people at     <a href="https://morfars.dk">Danish radio-controlled vehicle company     morfars.dk</a>     created a     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Na1hDZvu5Q">    GDPR-compliant shredder</a>.     “The faster you shred, the more compliant you are.”     Video is in Danish, but with English subtitles.     (Unsubtitled     <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjUakmojPOM/">    short version</a>.) </li>
<li>    At the 1:00 mark in the previous video, the subtitles say     “Mumbles: This is insane.”     I found this subtitle     hilarious because normal Danish already sounds like     mumbling.     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk">    Not even Danes can understand each other</a>. </li>

To help developers identify issues related to the first change of     Emperor most software will ever experience,     Windows 10 added a placeholder for the upcoming Era,     so you can test your applications before it’s too late.
