<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Freudian typo that will not die: Enchanced video quality</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>While <strike>wasting time</strike> doing valuable background research on my computer, I received the following suggestion:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> For enchanced video quality, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0">click here</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p> It’s good to know that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/06/4246963.aspx"> the typo that I first encountered in 1993</a> is still alive and kicking.</p>
<p> (And even though it’s not important to the story, people will demand some sort of follow-up, so here it is: I submitted feedback to the vendor, who said that it was a known issue fixed in the next update.) </p>
