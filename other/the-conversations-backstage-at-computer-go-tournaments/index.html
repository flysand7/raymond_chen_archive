<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steverowe/"> Steve Rowe</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steverowe/archive/2007/06/30/why-computers-can-t-play-go.aspx"> linked to</a> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article2002699.ece"> an essay on why computers can’t play Go well</a> even though they’ve mastered other “difficult” games like chess. I was reminded of a description I received of what happens backstage at computer Go tournaments (i.e., tournaments that pit Go-playing computers against each other). (“Backstage” is a bit of a misnomer, of course; since the contestants are computers, you can talk all you want as loud as you want without worrying about distracting the players.) </p>
<p> At computer Go tournaments, the programmers are like parents watching their children compete in a hockey game where they’ve only just barely learned how to skate. It’s not so much a matter of who plays better as it is a matter of who sucks less. One programmer will lean over to the other and say something like “I hope my program realizes its left-hand-side is vulnerable before your program takes advantage of it.” </p>
