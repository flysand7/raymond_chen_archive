Sometimes I see people ask a question and get an answer,
but the answer doesn’t quite work.
But instead of trying to understand the answer in order to see why
it doesn’t work and develop a better solution, they just play stupid.
Here’s an example.
The names have been changed but the story’s the same.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
How do I get a handle to a bright pink elephant?
We have a dialog box that talks about elephants, and we’d like to
put some information about the bright pink ones on it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
An answer came back rather quickly.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
Use <code>GetElephantHandle(EPHNT_BRIGHTPINK)</code>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Some time later, the customer came back with a follow-up question.
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
I can’t get it to work.
I get a compiler error:</p>
<pre>
error C2065: 'EPHNT_BRIGHTPINK' : undeclared identifier
</pre>
<p>
Am I missing a header file?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(So much for
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/03/942851.aspx#1001062">
people knowing what to do when they get this error message</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Don’t be helpless.
Your head isn’t just for looks.
At least pretend to try to understand what you’re doing.
In this case, the function is <code>GetElephantHandle</code>,
and you’re having trouble because the <code>EPHNT_BRIGHTPINK</code>
value we want isn’t defined.
Why not check out the values that <strong>are</strong> defined?
</p>
<pre>
#define EPHNT_DUMBO         0
#define EPHNT_BABAR         1
#define EPHNT_WHITE         2
#define EPHNT_BRIGHT_PINK   3
</pre>
<p>
Wow, I bet the person who wrote <code>EPHNT_BRIGHTPINK</code> really meant
<code>EPHNT_BRIGHT_PINK</code>.
</p>
<p>
Armed with this new skill, perhaps you can solve this person’s problem:
</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>
Somebody recommended that I add the <code>DS_SHELLEXT</code> style
to my property sheet dialog template to fix a sizing problem,
but when I try that, I get an error that tells
me that <code>DS_SHELLEXT</code> is not defined.
Is there a file I have to include?
