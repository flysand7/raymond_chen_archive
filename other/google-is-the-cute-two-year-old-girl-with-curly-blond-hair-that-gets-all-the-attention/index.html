<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Google is the cute two-year-old girl with curly blond hair that gets all the attention</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Let’s see, Google Maps adds the world outside the United States, Canada and the UK, and <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/18/1326214"> people go ga-ga</a>. Nevermind that Google’s new “maps” have nothing beyond country boundaries. “Aww, look at Google, she’s so cute and adorable!”
 I’m sure the people at the existing online map services like <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/"> MapQuest</a> and <a href="http://maps.msn.com/"> MSN MapPoint</a> are sitting there like older siblings, wondering when exactly they turned into chopped liver. MSN MapPoint has <strong>actual maps</strong> of most of Europe, and MapQuest’s library of maps is <strong>larger still</strong>. (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/dwvfp">Kathmandu</a> anyone?)  Both sites provide <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mappoint/msnmaps/mws_linking.mspx"> documentation</a> on <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/features/main.adp?page=lf_maps"> how to link directly to them</a>. Yet they don’t get drooled over.</p>
<p> Somebody at MapQuest should take out a full page ad that goes something like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> Dear Google Maps, </p>
<p> Welcome to the rest of the world! If you ever need driving directions, don’t hesitate to ask. </p>
<p> Love ever,<br/> <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> </p>
