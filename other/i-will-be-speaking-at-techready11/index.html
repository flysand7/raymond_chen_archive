<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I will be speaking at TechReady11</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Microsoft has an internal conference known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TechReady"> TechReady</a>, the eleventh edition of which will take place in Seattle next week.</p>
<p>Having learned that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091007-01/?p=16453" title="I will be speaking at Reflections|Projections 2009"> the way to get me to show up at your conference is to invite me</a>, the TechReady folks invited me to give a talk on advanced debugging techniques. I wasn’t their first choice, though. This talk is a regular event at TechReady, but the usual presenter (<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20081021-00/?p=20503" title="Strange things happen when you let people choose their own name, part 1">Lav Pivo</a>) will not be available; I’m a substitute. Lav usually knocks everybody dead with his presentation, so I’ve got big shoes to fill.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to squeeze preparing for this talk in amongst the things I actually get paid to do, and I hope I’ll get everything done before the conference organizers start yelling at me for not having gone through all the checklist items on schedule.</p>
<p>If you’re a Microsoft employee at TechReady, you can watch me sweat and panic on Friday at 1pm. I’ll also try to make it to Ask the Experts on Wednesday night.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: The presentation is technically a <i>Chalk Talk</i> (code CLICT400, and no I don’t know what those letters stand for, though the CT probably stands for Chalk Talk), in case you were wondering why you can’t find it in the session list.</p>
