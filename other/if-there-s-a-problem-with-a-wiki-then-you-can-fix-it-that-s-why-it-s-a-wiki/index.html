<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If there's a problem with a wiki, then you can fix it; that's why it's a wiki</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On an internal mailing list, somebody asked a question about how to do X with Y, and I replied with a link to an internal wiki that described how to do X with Y (answer: use the Z tool).
 Somebody else replied, “Time to update that article because the link to the Z tool is broken.”
 Apparently, this person forgot that one of the defining characteristics of a wiki is that it’s easy to edit. (Another characteristic is that it is collaboratively-edited; there is no central authority.)</p>
<p> In other words, if you see something wrong, <i>fix it yourself</i>. Don’t just stand around saying somebody should do something. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/18/10116870.aspx"> Be someone</a>. Because on a wiki, there is no default value for <i>somebody</i>. </p>
