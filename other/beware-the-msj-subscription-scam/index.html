<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Beware the MSJ subscription scam</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/toub/">Stephen Toub</a> from MSDN Magazine alerts us to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/toub/archive/2006/01/06/510099.aspx"> the MSJ subscription scam</a>. Somebody has been sending out (via paper mail) a fake subscription offer for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/"> Microsoft Systems Journal</a>, a magazine that ceased publication back in 2000. Read Stephen’s article for more details as well as a copy of the scam letter itself. (The address for the “publisher” is a rented mailbox at a what appears to be a UPS Store in the Beaumont Centre mall.) Under no circumstances send these people any money!</p>
