<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">We should just get rid of that stupid middle tier</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of our line-of-business applications sometimes gets very heavily loaded, and several times a day, when you try to issue a query or update a record, you’ll get the error message, “Unable to contact middle tier. (other technical gibberish goes here)”.
 Whenever this happens, I like to amuse myself by shouting “Stupid middle tier! We should just get rid of it. It’s always unresponsive.”
 Of course, this is a joke along the lines of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/05/741110.aspx"> changing that 15 to a 1</a>. The system follows the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_(computing)"> three-tier model</a>. Getting rid of the middle tier won’t actually fix anything.</p>
<p> But if the error message keeps blaming the middle tier, then to a naive user (or in this case, a willfully stupid one), getting rid of the problematic component might not sound like that bad an idea. </p>
