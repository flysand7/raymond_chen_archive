<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why don't per-item custom icons work when I open a Zip file or some other virtual folder?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer observed that when they opened a Zip file containing an Excel spreadsheet saved as XML, the icon for the spreadsheet in the Zip folder is just a plain XML icon rather than a fancy Excel-XML icon. “Is there any way to invoke a shell icon handler on an item inside a Zip folder?”
 Even if there were a way, you wouldn’t like it.
 Think about it: In order to determine whether the XML file should get a plain-XML icon or an Excel-XML icon, the Office icon handler needs to open the XML file and sniff around to see if has whatever it is that makes an XML file an Excel-XML file.
 This means that the Zip folder has to extract the file so that the icon handler can sniff it.
 This means that opening a Zip folder would result in <i>decompressing every file in it</i> just so that it can give the decompressed file to the icon handler so the icon handler can say what icon to show.
 You probably wouldn’t like that.</p>
<p> Therefore, Zip folders do not use icon handlers to obtain icons for items inside Zip files. It just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/01/145428.aspx"> uses the generic icon for the file extension</a>. </p>
