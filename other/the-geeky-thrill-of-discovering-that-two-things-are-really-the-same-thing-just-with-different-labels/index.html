<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The geeky thrill of discovering that two things are really the same thing, just with different labels</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Today’s post about binomial coefficients
was intended to be a warm-up for Catalan numbers,
but it turns out Eric Lippert already covered them,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/04/19/every-binary-tree-there-is.aspx">
first in the context of binary trees</a>,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/04/22/every-tree-there-is.aspx">
then in the context of arbitrary trees and forests</a>,
and then again
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/04/22/every-tree-there-is.aspx">
in the context of matched parentheses</a>.
Another way of seeing the correspondence
between forests and matched parentheses is simply to consider
each <code>{</code> as an XML open-tag and each <code>}</code> as
an XML end-tag.
</p>
<p>
One thing to take away from the enumeration of objects controlled
by Catalan numbers is that when you see multiplication in a recurrence
relation, that typically corresponds to a nested loop.
(We saw this ourselves when we studied Stirling numbers of the second kind.)
</p>
<p>
The correspondence between binary trees and arbitrary forests
is done by simply renaming variables:
<code>left­Child</code> and <code>right­Child</code>
turn into
<code>first­Child</code> and <code>next­Sibling</code>.
</p>
<p>
Renaming variables also
reveals an interesting equivalence
between the two algorithms for
reversing a linked list.
One technique is to do link rewriting:
</p>
<pre>
Node *Reverse(Node *head)
{
 Node *prev = nullptr;
 while (head) {
  // The node we are rewriting
  Node *current = head;
  // Advance to next node before
  // we overwrite the outbound pointer
  head = current-&gt;next;
  // Repoint to previous node
  current-&gt;next = prev;
  // Advance the trailing pointer
  prev = current;
 }
 return prev;
}
</pre>
<p>
Another technique is to pop nodes off one list while pushing
them onto another.
</p>
<pre>
Node *Reverse(Node *head)
{
 Node *result = nullptr;
 while (head) {
  // Pop
  Node *current = head;
  head = current-&gt;next;
  // Push
  current-&gt;next = result;
  result = current;
 }
 return result;
}
</pre>
<p>
But if you look more closely at the two versions,
you’ll see that they are not really two algorithms.
They are the <i>same</i> algorithm, just with different
comments and variable names!
</p>
<p>
One of my colleagues used this as an interview question and guided
candidates through both algorithms, only to discover
later that they were actually the same algorithm,
merely viewed through different-colored glasses.</p>
