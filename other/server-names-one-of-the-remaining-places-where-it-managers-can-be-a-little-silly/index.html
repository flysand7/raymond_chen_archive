<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Server names: One of the remaining places where IT managers can be a little silly</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, ComputerWorld ran a story on <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2597702/data-center/server-names-put-the-fun-in-functional.html">whimsical names for servers</a>. </p>
<p>I recall that at my university, one academic department had machines named <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>. I’m sure this led to some strange <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/humor4.shtml"><i>Who’s on First?</i></a>-style messages.¹ </p>
<p>The early email servers at Microsoft were named after <a href="https://muppets.disney.com/">muppets</a>. I’m guessing that this came from the term Multiport Transceiver, generally abbreviated MPT and pronounced like the word <i>muppet</i>. (Nowadays, we call these things <i>routers</i>.) </p>
<p>When the IT department ran out of names of muppets, they started using names of trees. (Mine was <i>ironwood</i>.) </p>
<p>Nowadays, the names of the email servers are functional and consequently extremely boring. For example, <i>RED06FT010</i> is a server located in <u>Red</u>mond, and the other digits and letters indicate where the server can be found. Sorry, I don’t know how to decode the values. I’ve never needed to visit a server in person. </p>
<p>¹ I want to think this was the physics department, and that they had four other servers named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark#Classification"><i>charm</i>, <i>strange</i>, <i>top</i>, and <i>bottom</i></a>. </p>
