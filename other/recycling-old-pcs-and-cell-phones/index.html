<p> PC World reports that <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,120544,00.asp"> eBay has set up a recycling initiative</a> called <a href="http://rethink.ebay.com/">rethink</a>. The web site includes organizations that will accept donations or recycle your old equipment. In the Seattle area, the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/dnrp/swd/electronics/partners.asp"> Take It Back Network</a> will accept your old equipment for reuse or recycling. </p>
<p> On the other hand, I have equipment so old nobody would take it. </p>
