<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Charles Petzold's Programming Windows Sixth Edition has reached Release Preview</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We interrupt this program for a word from Microsoft Press.
 A few months ago, I noted that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/05/17/10306079.aspx"> Charles Petzold is coming back with another edition of Programming Windows</a>, and you could have gotten in on the ground floor and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2012/04/21/mark-your-calendars-programming-windows-sixth-edition-is-coming.aspx"> ordered your copy for only $10</a> which included access to all prerelease versions.</p>
<p> Well, the book has reached Release Preview, which means that the sticker price has increased to $30, so if you missed your chance earlier, you can at least get your order in before it goes up to $40 on August 28 and before it reaches its final price of $50 on November 15. And as with the people who acted quickly, your $30 order includes access to the Release Preview and the Final version. </p>
