<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On paying for your meal upon leaving a restaurant</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/24.html#a10745"> Robert Scoble’s embarrassment over forgetting to pay a restaurant bill</a> reminds me of an even more embarrassing incident experienced by a component team from the Windows 95 team.</p>
<p> To celebrate something or other, their team went to lunch at <a href="http://www.salishlodge.com/dining.php"> The Salish Lodge</a>, a fine dining establishment. At the end of the meal, everybody thought somebody else was going to handle the bill, and they all walked out as a group. The administrative assistant who made the reservation received a somewhat concerned telephone call from the restaurant when they discovered that a large party just skipped the check. Profuse apologies were extended and the bill was settled over the phone (with what I assume was a very generous tip). I just happened to be in the hallway when this whole thing happened and got to hear the story from the very exasperated administrative assistant shortly after it transpired. </p>
<p> So remember, folks:  Pay the bill before leaving the restaurant. It saves everybody a lot of grief. </p>
