<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I programmatically invoke Aero Peek on a window?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know if there was a way for their application to invoke the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/11/20/happy-anniversary-windows-on-the-evolution-of-the-taskbar.aspx"> Aero Peek feature</a> so that their window appeared and all the other windows on the system turned transparent.
 No, there is no such programmatic interface exposed. Aero Peek is a feature for the user to invoke, not a feature for applications to invoke so they can draw attention to themselves.
 Yes, I realize you wrote a program so awesome that all other programs pale in comparison, and that part of your mission is to make all the other programs <i>literally</i> pale in comparison to your program.
 Sorry.</p>
<p> Maybe you can meet up with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/22/9939868.aspx"> that other program that is the most awesome program in the history of the universe</a> and share your sorrows over a beer. </p>
