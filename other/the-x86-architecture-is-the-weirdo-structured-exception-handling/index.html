<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The x86 architecture is the weirdo: Structured exception handling</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If your reference architecture is x86, then you will think that everything it does is normal and the rest of the world is weird. Except it’s the other way around: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/14/229387.aspx"> The x86 architecture is the weirdo</a>.</p>
<p> I was reminded of this when commenter 640k complained, on the subject of what I think is table-based structured exception handling, “It would be interesting to know why this ‘invention’ <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/12/01/10243095.aspx#10243967"> was introduced in 64-bit Windows</a> when no other version of Windows requires it.” (The original text was “when no other OS requires it”, but I’m assuming that this was in the context of Windows-based OS, since unix doesn’t have structured exception handling in the first place.) </p>
<p> This has a very narrow definition of “no other OS”, because it really means “No other non-x86-based version of Windows.” In this world, the color of the sky is x86. </p>
<p> In fact, x86 is the <i>only</i> architecture for which Windows uses stack-based exception chaining. All other architectures use table-based exception unwinding. The prologue and epilogue of each function must follow a particular format so that the actions performed therein can be unwound during exception handling. At the very introduction of Win32, it was only the x86 which used stack-based unwinding. The Alpha AXP, MIPS, and PowerPC all used used table-based exception unwinding. And as new architectures were added by Windows, they all used table-based exception unwinding as well. Itanium? Table-based. <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.08.windowsconfidential.aspx"> Alpha AXP 64-bit</a>? Table-based. ARM? Table-based. </p>
<p> The use of table-based exception handling was not “introduced” with x64. It was introduced back in 1992, and has in fact been the exception unwinding mechanism for all architectures. </p>
<p> Well, almost all. Not the x86, because the x86 is the weirdo. </p>
