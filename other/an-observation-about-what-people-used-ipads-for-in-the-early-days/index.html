<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An observation about what people used iPads for in the early days</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Shortly after the iPad was introduced, I heard a story about an interaction that was observed between two airplane passengers.</p>
<p>Across the aisle from my colleague were two people traveling together. One of them pulled out his iPad and launched into what was effectively an extended sales demonstration for the device to his seatmate. Look at me launch this, read that, view that. See what else it can do? Look at this.</p>
<p>Eventually, his free demonstration ended, and then he said to his seatmate. “Okay, let’s work on that presentation. Did you bring your laptop?” His seatmate reached down, pulled out an old-school laptop, and the two set to work.</p>
<p>Laptops: For getting work done.</p>
<p>As my colleague quipped, “Sure, the iPad is lightweight and easy to carry. Especially if you also bring 100+ pounds of executive assistant with you, too, to carry the other stuff.”</p>
<p>Happy birthday, iPad.</p>
