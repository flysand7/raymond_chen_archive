<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond’s 2005 MVP Global Summit event diary</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In case those coming into town for the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/gp/MVPSMT2005"> 2005 MVP Global Summit</a> were interesting in chatting with me, here’s my event diary for this week. (Non-native-English-speaking MVPs can hover over the highlighted words for a translation from slang into “standard American-English”.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though it’s not affiliated with the MVP Global Summit,     I’ll mention it anyway since it happens the same week:     I’ll be at CodeSlam on Tuesday night.     The name is a play on     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_Slam">     Poetry Slam</a>, but     instead of reciting poetry, you share your code.     If you’re an MVP with a cool app you want to contribute     to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/">CodeGallery</a>,     and you want to be part of the biggest geek     slumber party in Redmond, let me know.     I can bring one guest.     (However, since I am old and decrepit and have a job to go to the     following morning, I probably won’t last the whole night.) </li>
<li>I am trying to     <a style="background: highlight;color: highlighttext" title="obtain by devious means">     finagle</a>     a ticket to the Windows Shell/User MVP dinner     on Thursday evening. </li>
<li>If I can’t get a ticket to the MVP dinner, I’ll definitely     <a style="background: highlight;color: highlighttext" title="attend uninvited">     crash</a>     the Windows Shell/User MVP lunch on Friday. </li>
<li>I’ll     <a style="background: highlight;color: highlighttext" title="pay a brief visit">     pop by</a>     the MVP Barbecue on Saturday to     <a style="background: highlight;color: highlighttext" title="establish contact">     touch base</a>     with the MVPs in disciplines other than Windows Shell/User. </li>
</ul>
<p> If you want to be sure to catch me, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/contact.aspx" style="background: highlight;color: highlighttext" title="write me a note"> drop me a line</a> and I’ll try to make time to see you. Note, however, that I’m doing this outside of my “regular job”, so please be a bit understanding if a work emergency forces me to do some last-minute rescheduling. </p>
<p> [Colors fixed 8:30am; sorry I was half-asleep when I wrote this entry.] </p>
