<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why didn't Windows XP auto-elevate programs beyond those named setup.exe?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter J-F has a friend who wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1621407"> why Windows XP didn’t auto-elevate all installers</a> but rather only the ones named setup.exe. (Perhaps that friend’s name is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1719264"> Josh</a>, who repeated the question twelve days later.)
 Remember what the starting point was. In Windows 2000, <i>nothing</i> was auto-elevated.
 Before adding a feature, you have to know what problem the feature is trying to solve. The problem is improving the experience for non-administrators who want to install software. When they try to install a program and forget to use the <i>Run as</i> feature, then instead of proceeding halfway through the installer and then getting an <i>Access denied</i> error, do the <i>Run as</i> for them automatically.
 Knowing whether the user is running an installer that requires elevation requires a degree of semantic analysis beyond what you want to add to the <code>Create­Process</code> code path. Hey, here’s a program called <code>PRONT4.EXE</code>. Is it an installer? Turns out that it is. And then there are the programs that might be installers, depending on what other command line switches you provide.
 Given that you’re reduced to a heuristic, you have to decide what the acceptable rates of false positives and false negatives will be. If you guess wrong and think a program requires administrator privileges when it doesn’t, then you’ve screwed over all the non-administrators who want to use the program. “I used to be able to run this program, but now when I try, I’m asked for the administrator password, which I do not know. Windows broke my program.” The effect of a false positive is <i>My program stops working</i>.
 On the other hand, if you fail to detect a program that requires being run with administrator privileges, the behavior is the same as before: The user gets an <i>Access denied</i> error. The effect of a false negative is <i>No change</i>.
 Given that the cost of a false positive is huge and the cost of a false negative is zero, you can see that the math says to use a conservative heuristic. The heuristic is that a program named <code>setup.exe</code> will be treated as an installation program, and nothing else.
 Windows was under no obligation to auto-detect installation programs. Indeed, according to the strict interpretation of operating system design, it <i>shouldn’t</i> do this. If the user says to run this program at the current privilege level, then you darned well better run the program with the current privilege level. The treatment of programs named <code>setup.exe</code> is really just a compatibility hack, a courtesy to make your life a little bit easier.
 It’s a case of giving somebody five dollars and being asked <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/10/8080067.aspx"> why you didn’t give them ten</a>.</p>
<p> Starting in Windows Vista, applications can specify via a manifest whether they want to run at the privilege level the user requested (<code>requested­Execution­Level level="as­Invoker"</code>) or always to elevate to administrator (requestedExecution­Level level=”require­Administrator”). Hopefully, all new applications will specify their elevation requirements explicitly, and the heuristic will be necessary only for old programs. ­e&gt;</p>
