<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway: Writing to the application directory</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We received a security vulnerability report that went roughly like this:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
There is a security vulnerability in the X component.
It loads <code>shell32.dll</code> from the current directory,
thereby making it vulnerable to a current directory attack.
Here is a sample program that illustrates the problem.
Copy a rogue <code>shell32.dll</code> into the current directory
and run the program.
Observe that the rogue
<code>shell32.dll</code> is loaded instead of the system one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you actually followed the instructions,
what you saw depended on your definition of “run the program.”
Let’s assume that the program has been placed in the directory
<code>C:\sample\sample.exe</code>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting the current directory to the application directory.
<pre>
cd /d C:\sample
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll
c:\sample\sample.exe
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack succeeds.</p>
<li>Setting the current directory to an unrelated directory.
<pre>
cd /d %USERPROFILE%
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll
c:\sample\sample.exe
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack fails.</p>
<li>Running the application from Explorer.
<pre>
copy \\rogue\server\shell32.dll C:\sample
<i>double-click sample.exe in Explorer</i>
</pre>
<p>In this case, the attack succeeds.
</p></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
Let’s look at case 3 first.
In case 3, what is the current directory?
When you launch a program from Explorer,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/10/10088566.aspx">
the current directory is set to the directory of the thing
you double-clicked</a>.
Therefore, case 3 is identical to case 1.
That’s one less case to have to study.
</p>
<p>
We also see that the attack
is not strictly a current directory attack,
because the attack failed in case 2
even though a rogue <code>shell32.dll</code> was in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
What we’re actually seeing is an <i>application directory</i> attack.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the application directory is searched ahead of the
system directory.
Therefore, you can override a file in the system directory
by putting it in your application directory.
This is part of the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/20/10176772.aspx">
<i>directory as a bundle</i> principle</a>.
If you packaged a DLL with your application,
then presumably that’s the one you want,
even if a future version of Windows decides to create a DLL of the same name.
</p>
<p>
The vulnerability report sort of acknowledged that this was
an application directory attack rather than a current directory
attack when they explained why this is a serious problem:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
By placing a rogue copy of <code>shell32.dll</code> in the
<code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12</code> directory,
an attacker can inject arbitrary code into all Office applications.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If the attack were really a current directory attack,
the attacker would have put a rogue copy of
<code>shell32.dll</code> in the directory containing your
Excel spreadsheet, not the directory containing
<code>EXCEL.EXE</code>.
</p>
<p>
And that’s where you reach the airtight hatchway:
Normal users do not have write permission into the
<code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12</code> directory.
You need administrator privileges to create files there.
And if you have administrator privileges,
then you already pwn the machine.
It’s not really a vulnerability that you can do anything you want
once you pwn the machine.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this non-vulnerability does expose a security
issue you need to bear in mind when you run your own programs:
Your application’s directory is its airtight hatchway.
Make sure you control who you let in!
If you leave your application directory world-writeable,
then you’ve effectively left your airtight hatchway unlocked.
This is one reason why the Microsoft Logo guidelines
recommend (require?) that programs be
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/07/10278793.aspx">
installed into the
Program Files directory</a>:
The default security descriptor for subdirectories of Program Files
does not grant write permission to normal users.
It’s secure by default.
</p>
<p>
There are many variations of this type of vulnerability report,
and they nearly always are mischaracterized as a current directory attack.
They usually go like this:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
There is a DLL planting vulnerability in LITWARE.EXE.
Place a rogue DLL named SHELL32.DLL in the same directory as LITWARE.EXE.
When LITWARE.EXE is run, the rogue DLL is loaded from the current directory,
resulting in code injection.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The person who submits the report has confused the application directory
with the current directory, probably because they never considered that
the two might be different.
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test
C:\&gt; cd C:\test
C:\test&gt; copy \\trusted\server\LITWARE.EXE
C:\test&gt; copy \\rogue\server\SHELL32.DLL
C:\test&gt; LITWARE
-- observe that the rogue DLL is loaded
-- proof of current directory attack
</pre>
<p>
They never tried this:
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test
C:\&gt; cd C:\test
C:\test&gt; copy \\trusted\server\LITWARE.EXE
C:\&gt; mkdir C:\test2
C:\&gt; cd C:\test2
C:\test2&gt; copy \\rogue\server\SHELL32.DLL
C:\test2&gt; ..\test\LITWARE
-- observe that the rogue DLL is not loaded
</pre>
<p>
That second experiment shows that the attack is not a current
directory attack at all.
It’s an application directory attack.
</p>
<p>
Each time one of these reports comes in, we have to perform
the same evaluation to confirm that it really is an application
directory attack and not a current directory attack.
(This means, among other things, repeating the test on every
version of Windows, and every version of LitWare, and every
combination of the two, just to make sure all the possibilities
have been covered.
The odds are strong that it will all turn into a false alarm,
but who knows. Maybe there’s something about the interaction between
LitWare 5.2 SP2
and Windows XP SP3 that triggers a new code path that
does indeed try to load <code>shell32.dll</code> from the
current directory.
And it’s that specific combination of circumstances the person
was trying to report, but did a bad job of expressing.)</p>
