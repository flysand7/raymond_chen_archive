<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I'll see (some of) you in Los Angeles in September</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/"> Jeremy Mazner</a> has asked me to put together a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2005/06/20/430690.aspx"> 400-level</a> session at this year’s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/"> PDC</a>. I came up with the title “Five(ish) things every Win32 developer should know (but likely doesn’t)”. Of course, now I have to think of five things! Here are some ideas I’ve been kicking around.</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory scene:     Physical address space != physical memory != virtual memory !=     virtual address space </li>
<li>Consequences of the way CPUs work:     How my O(n) algorithm can run circles around your O(log n) algorithm;     why much of what you learned in school simply doesn’t matter </li>
<li>Parent vs. owner windows </li>
<li>Asynchronous input queues, the hazards of attaching thread input,     and how it happens without your knowledge </li>
<li>Dialog units, DPI and the overloaded term “large fonts” </li>
</ul>
<p> Would you go to a talk that covered these topics? If not, what topics would you rather hear me talk about?</p>
<p> <b>Follow-up</b>: The talk will be a little over an hour. (And fixed the title. Thanks, Dave.) </p>
