<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The 2010 Niney Award nominees have been announced</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The nominees for the first (annual?) <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/TheChannel9Team/The-Niney-are-coming-VOTE-NOW"> Niney Awards</a> have been announced. The Nineys are an award which recognizes those who have had the greatest impact on the technical/developer community over the past year. Winners are selected by you, the technical/developer community.
 The winners will be announced at the <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/"> MIX11 conference</a> in April. But before they can announce winners, they need to collect votes.
 That’s where you come in.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22BQU9KHP5G/"> Cast your vote online</a> in the following categories: </p>
<ul>

<p> Now, it so happens that among the nominees is an author of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> a somewhat unsucessful book on programming</a> (not to be confused with an author of several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/?field-author=Mark+Russinovich&amp;node=5&amp;tag=tholneth-20"> successful books on programming</a> and a <a href="http://www.zerodaythebook.com/"> to-be-published novel</a>) but please don’t let that distract you from voting for whoever you feel best deserves to win. </p>
