<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Even more about C# anonymous methods, from the source</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> If you want to know still more about C# anonymous methods, you can check out the web site of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/"> Grant Richins</a> who has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/category/3378.aspx"> an entire category devoted to anonymous methods</a>, and he should know, since <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/04/688527.aspx#688962"> he actually implemented them</a>. </p>
<p> Now that CLR week is over, I’m curious what you all thought of it. Would you like to see another CLR week at some point? Should I stick to Win32? (Or doesn’t it matter because I’m an arrogant Microsoft apologist either way?) </p>
