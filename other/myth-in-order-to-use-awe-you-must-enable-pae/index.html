<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Myth: In order to use AWE, you must enable PAE</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp"> Address Windowing Extensions (AWE)</a> does not require PAE. I don’t know why some people claim that it does, since it is so easy to demonstrate otherwise.
 Take a program that uses AWE. If you don’t have one handy, you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/awe_example.asp"> use the one that comes in MSDN as a sample program that demonstrates how to use AWE</a>. Grant yourself “Lock Pages in Memory” privileges and run the program. Observe that it works.
 Now remove the /PAE switch from your boot.ini, reboot, and run the program again. Observe that it still works.</p>
<p> Myth disproved by direct experimentation and observation. </p>
