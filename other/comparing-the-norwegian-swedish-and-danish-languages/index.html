<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Comparing the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish languages.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As I got onto the plane for my outbound flight,  I grabbed a Norwegian newspaper,  having mistaken it for a Swedish paper.  Fortunately, the two languages are so similar I was able to fake  my way through it without too much difficulty.  (And it’s definitely an odd sensation reading  U.S. cartoons translated into Norwegian…)
  The on-board entertainment system offered diversions in many  languages.  So I watched “Loony Tunes” dubbed into German  (confirming that I really need to practice my German more)  and then listened to some children’s stories in various language.  Demonstrating my astonishingly poor listening comprehension,  I couldn’t figure out whether the first story was in Norwegian  or Swedish.  Eventually I convinced myself that it was Norwegian,  which was confirmed when I later heard a story in Swedish.</p>
<p>  Danish, on the other hand, is pretty obviously Danish.  </p>
