<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exported functions that are really forwarders</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Last time, we saw how
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/18/669668.aspx">
the way Win32 exports functions</a>
is pretty
much the same as the way 16-bit Windows exports functions,
but with a change in emphasis
from ordinal-based exports to name-based exports.
This change in emphasis is not expressed anywhere in the file format;
both 16-bit and 32-bit DLLs can export either by name or by ordinal
(or by both), but the designers of Win32 were biased in spirit
in favor of name-only exports.
</p>
<p>
But there is a new type of exported function in Win32, known as a forwarder.
A forwarder looks just like a regular exported function, except that
the entry in the ordinal export table says, “Oh, I’m not really a
function in this DLL. I’m really a function in that DLL over there.”
For example,
if you do a
<code>link /dump /exports kernel32.dll</code>, you’ll see a line
like this:
</p>
<pre>
151   EnterCriticalSection (forwarded to NTDLL.RtlEnterCriticalSection)
</pre>
<p>
This means that if a program links to
<code>KERNEL32.EnterCriticalSection</code>,
the loader silently
redirects it to <code>NTDLL.RtlEnterCriticalSection</code>.
Forwarders are a handy way to accommodate functionality moving from
one DLL to another.
The old DLL can continue to export the function but forward it to
the new DLL.
</p>
<p>
The forwarding trick is actually better than just having a stub
function in the old DLL that calls the function in the new DLL,
because the stub function creates a dependency between the old DLL and the
new one.
(After all, the old DLL needs to be linked to the new DLL in order
to call it!)
With a forwarder, however, the new DLL is not loaded unless somebody
actually asks for the forwarded function from the old DLL.
As a result, you don’t pay for the new DLL until somebody actually wants it.
</p>
<p>
Okay, we saw that with forwarders, Win32 has diverged from 16-bit Windows,
but when it comes to imports, it’s a whole new ball game.
We’ll pick up the story next time.</p>
