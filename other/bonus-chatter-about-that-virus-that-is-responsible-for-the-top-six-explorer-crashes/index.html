<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Bonus chatter about that virus that is responsible for the top six Explorer crashes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year, I wrote about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/21/8525411.aspx"> a virus that is responsible for the top six Explorer crashes</a>, by a wide margin.</p>
<p> I learned later how the authors of this XYZ Virus operate, and it happens to answer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/21/8525411.aspx#8528804"> a question posted by commenter SteveL</a> as to why these virus writers are so incompetent that they crash so much. </p>
<p> First, the virus authors infect your computer and crash your system every so often <i>on purpose</i>. Meanwhile, they also set up a legitimate-looking Web site which sells anti-virus software that claims to remove this virus. You send them your money, they send you the software. </p>
<p> The kicker is that the removal software <i>doesn’t work</i>. Your computer is still infected with the XYZ virus. But they don’t care. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gnomes_(South_Park)&amp;oldid=212904113#The_Gnomes"> They already got your money</a>. </p>
