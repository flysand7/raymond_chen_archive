<p>If you have to ask about various operating system limits, you’re probably doing something wrong.
 If you’re <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/18/44379.aspx"> nesting windows more than 50 levels deep</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/30/46594.aspx"> nesting menus more than 25 levels deep</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/21/161375.aspx"> creating a dialog box with more than 65535 controls</a>, or nesting tree-view items more than 255 levels deep, then your user interface design is in serious need of rethought, because you just created a usability nightmare.
 If you have to ask about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/29/444912.aspx"> the maximum number of threads a process can create</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/10/56028.aspx"> the maximum length of a command line</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/06/657868.aspx"> the maximum size of an environment block</a> or <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986/"> the maximum amount of data you can store in the registry</a>, then you probably have some rather serious design flaws in your program.
 I’m not saying that knowing the limits isn’t useful, but in many cases, <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0405c&amp;L=ads-l&amp;P=12106"> if you have to ask, you can’t afford it</a>.
 <b>Nitpicker’s corner</b></p>
<p> Notice that I said “probably”. In my experience, probably 90% of the people who ask what the limit is have either bumped into it or are considering a design that will. The fact that you folks can come up with suggestions for the other 10% doesn’t invalidate my point. </p>
