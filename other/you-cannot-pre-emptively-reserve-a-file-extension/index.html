<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You cannot pre-emptively reserve a file extension</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The following question came in from a customer:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> If our program isn’t installed and users double-click our document, they get sent to a Web site that presents a list of programs, but we want to send the user directly to our download site. How do we claim a file extension for our application? </p></blockquote>
<p> Um, you don’t. </p>
<p> You cannot pre-emptively reserve a file extension. If your program uses the extension <code>.ABC</code> and somebody off in another country working out of a garage also uses the extension <code>.ABC</code>, then that’s fine. Of course, things get exciting when a user installs both your program and the garage program, but that’s a conflict for the user to resolve. It is not your position to declare unilaterally that you are more important than that person in a garage. </p>
<p> What you <i>can</i> do is list your program among the ones that support the <code>.ABC</code> extension, so that when the user double-clicks an <code>.ABC</code> document and no program is installed to handle it, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/13/9311703.aspx"> the user is sent to a Web page that includes your program as one which can open that file</a>. But this doesn’t grant you exclusivity. You’ll just show up on the list with everybody else who wants to claim that file extension. </p>
