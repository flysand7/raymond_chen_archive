<p> <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/users/davevr/"> David Vronay</a> writes about <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/26/The-UI-design-minefield-_2D00_-er_2E002E002E00_-flower-field_3F003F00_.aspx"> the difficult balance that has to be maintained</a> between people who like the classic Windows game Minesweeper and people who are (understandably) upset that Windows includes a <i>game</i> about landmines, trivializing a very serious issue. (Yes, the image used in the game is a water mine, not a land mine, but that’s scant consolation.) </p>
<p> By the way, David, you see, the idea behind “Find the Flowers” is that it’s bad to step on flowers. </p>
