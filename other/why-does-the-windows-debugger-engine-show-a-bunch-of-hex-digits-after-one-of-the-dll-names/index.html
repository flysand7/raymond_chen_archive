<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the Windows debugger engine show a bunch of hex digits after one of the DLL names?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You’re using the Windows debugger engine, say ntsd or windbg, and some DLLs come with hex digits after their names. What’s up with that?</p>
<pre><span style="border: solid 1px black;">contoso_7ffe7d0e0000</span>!GetWidgetName:

00007ffe`7d0e2f57 48896810        mov     qword ptr [rax+10h],rbp

<p>There are two modules named <code>contoso</code> loaded into the same program. The first one gets its name the normal way, since it got there first. The second one sees that its name is already taken, so it generates a unique name by appending the module’s base address.</p>
<p>This name conflict can occur because you have two DLLs with the same name but in different directories. Or it could be a conflict between two modules with the same base name but different extensions. (Sometimes, the debugger disambiguates by appending the extension. I’m not quite sure what the algorithm is.)</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: How did I know this? Did I read the debugger source code? Nope, I just figured it out by direct observation. “Why would the debugger have to add a bunch of extra information to the module name? Maybe because the module name isn’t unique.” It’s like asking, “When Bob goes to some classes, people call him ‘Bob S.’ instead of just Bob. But the other students still go by just their first names.” One thing you might guess is, “Maybe there are two students named Bob in those classes.”</p>
