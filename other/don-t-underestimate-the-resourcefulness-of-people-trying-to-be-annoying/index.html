<p> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/"> TechNet Magazine</a>‘s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/01/"> January • February 2006 issue</a> is now available, including <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/01/WindowsConfidential/"> a short article from me on the resourcefulness of people trying to be annoying</a>. The issue also has an article on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/01/RapidRecovery/"> how to use the Volume Shadow Copy Service</a> which <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/06/461390.aspx"> I mentioned a few months ago</a>. (And if you had read that posting from last September, you’ll know why the Previous Versions Client is kept in a folder called “twclient”. Try using that at a party to impress someone.)</p>
