<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sometimes people can be so helpless: Finding the owner of a Web page</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Internal to Microsoft are thousands of Web sites. This is a story about one of them. </p>
<p> On an internal discussion list, somebody asked </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We just created a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense_word"> Flurb</a>. Does anyone know how to get listed on http://internalsite/newflurbs? </p></blockquote>
<p> I hadn’t heard of that site before, but I checked it out. Neat, it’s basically a blog which announces new Flurbs. I can see how somebody would want their Flurb to be listed there. I also saw lots of pieces of information on the page which the person appears not to have noticed. I replied, </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> Um, how about the <i>Email</i> link in the navigation bar? Or did you try that and it didn’t work? </p>
<p> Also, each entry has the same name at the bottom. You could try contacting that person. </p>
<p> Just giving you some ideas on problem-solving techniques. </p>

<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: “Hey, Raymond, where’s your contact link?” I was forced to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/22/232903.aspx"> disable the contact link</a> some time ago because it was being used primarily to send spam. Finding my email address is left as an exercise. (It’s not hard.) </p>
