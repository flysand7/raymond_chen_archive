<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to change the debugger attached to a process</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Suppose your application crashes and debugger X is automatically connected because that’s how the system happened to be configured. But you would prefer to use debugger Y. After installing debugger Y, how do you switch the debugger from X to Y? If you try to connect debugger Y to the process, you get the error code <code>STATUS_PORT_ALREADY_SET</code>, because only one debugger can be connected to a process at a time. But if you disconnect the old debugger, the application will disappear with it. How do you escape from this Catch-22?
 Here’s what you do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach the ntsd debugger in non-invasive mode:     use -pv instead of -p when specifying the process id. </li>
<li>The ntsd debugger will suspend all the threads in the process. </li>
<li>Now tell debugger X to resume the process and detach from it.     (If debugger X is ntsd,     then the command for this is <code>qd</code>.) </li>
<li>Next, tell debugger Y to attach to the process. </li>
<li>Finally, go to the ntsd debugger which you attached in non-invasive mode,     and tell it to detach with the <code>qd</code> command. </li>
</ul>
<p> This trick works because the non-invasive mode of debugging doesn’t actually connect to the process as a debugger. It merely suspends all the threads in the process and lets you snoop around its memory. As a result, when you disconnect the original debugger and tell it to resume execution of the application, the application doesn’t actually resume because the non-invasive ntsd is keeping it suspended. You then can attach the new debugger to the process and resume your debugging.</p>
<p> In other words, the non-invasive ntsd acts as a bridge, holding the process frozen while one debugger gets out and another one comes in. </p>
