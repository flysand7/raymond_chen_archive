I have appended a file exploit.pl which exploits a vulnerability
in XYZ version N.M.  The result is a denial of service.
The perl script generates a file, which if double-clicked,
results in a crash in XYZ.

<p>
You may have trouble finding the exploit buried in that perl script,
because the perl script consists almost entirely of graffiti
and posturing and chest-thumping.
(You may also have noticed a bug.)
Here is the script with all the fluff removed:
</p>
<pre>
$theexploit = "\0";
open(file, "&gt;exploit.xyz");
print(file $theexploit);
</pre>
<p>
This could’ve been conveyed in a simple sentence:
“Create a one-byte file consisting of a single null byte.”
But if you did that, then you wouldn’t get your chance
to put your name up in lights on the screen of a Microsoft
security researcher!
</p>
<p>
(For the record, the issue being reported
was not only known, a patch for it had already been issued
at the time the report came in.
The crash is simply a self-inflicted denial of service
with no security consequences.
There isn’t even any data loss because XYZ can open only
one file at a time, so by the time it crashes, all your
previous work must already have been saved.)</p>
