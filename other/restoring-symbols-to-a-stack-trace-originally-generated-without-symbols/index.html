Ugh.
A stack trace taken without working symbols.
(There’s no way that
<code>Dll­Get­Class­Object</code>
is a deeply recursive 60KB function.
Just by casual inspection, you know that the symbols are wrong.)
</p>
<p>
To see how to fix this, you just have to understand what the
debugger does when it has no symbols to work from:
It uses the symbols from the exported function table.
For every address it wants to resolve,
it looks for the nearest exported function whose address is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2_A">
less than or equal to</a> the target value.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose <code>CONTOSO.DLL</code>
has the following exported symbols:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<th>Symbol</th>
<th>Offset</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Dll­Get­Class­Object</code></td>
<td align="right"><code>0x5132</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Dll­Can­Unload­Now</code></td>
<td align="right"><code>0xFB0B</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Look at it this way:
The debugger is given the following information about your module:
(Diagram not to scale.)
</p>
<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" title="An empty horizontal box with the label DllGetClassObject at approximately 20% and the label DllCanUnloadNow at approximately 60%.">
<tr>
<td colspan="5" style="border: solid black .75pt"> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 2em"> </td>
<td align="center" style="width: 1em">↑</td>
<td style="padding-right: 4em">Dll­Get­Class­Object</td>
<td align="center" style="width: 1em">↑</td>
<td style="padding-right: 8em">Dll­Can­Unload­Now</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
It needs to assign a function to every byte in the module.
In the absence of any better information, it does it like this:
</p>
<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" title="A horizontal box in three parts. From 0% to 20% is labeled with question marks. From 20% to 60% is labeled DllGetClassObject. From 60% to 100% is labeled DllCanUnloadNow.">
<tr>
<td align="center" style="border: solid black .75pt;width: 2em;background-color: #FFC0C0">???</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid black .75pt;padding-right: 5em;background-color: #C0FFFF">Dll­Get­Class­Object</td>
<td style="border: solid black .75pt;padding-right: 9em;background-color: #FFC0FF">Dll­Can­Unload­Now</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In words, it assumes that every function begins at the location specified
by the export table,
and it ends one byte before the start of the next function.
The debugger is trying to make the best of a bad situation.
</p>
<p>
Suppose your DLL was loaded at
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/12/27/10380848.aspx">
<code>0x10000000</code></a>,
and the debugger needs to generate a symbolic name for the address
<code>0x1000E4F5</code>.
</p>
<p>
First, it converts the address into a relative virtual address
by subtracting the DLL base address,
leaving <code>0xE4F5</code>.
</p>
<p>
Next, it looks to see what function “contains” that address.
From the algorithm described above,
the debugger concludes that the address <code>0xE4F5</code> is
“part of” the
<code>Dll­Get­Class­Object</code> function,
which began at
begins at <code>0x5132</code>.
The offset into the function is therefore
<code>0xE4F5 - 0x5132 = 0x93C3</code>,
and it is reported in the debugger as
<code>contoso!Dll­Get­Class­Object+0x93c3</code>.
</p>
<p>
Repeat this exercise for each address that the debugger needs to resolve,
and you get the stack trace above.
</p>
<p>
Fine, now that you know how the bad symbols were generated,
how do you fix it?
</p>
<p>
You fix it by undoing what the debugger did, and then redoing it
with better symbols.
</p>
<p>
You need to find the better symbols.
This is not too difficult if you still have a matching binary
and symbol file,
because you can just load up the binary into the debugger
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/doronh/archive/2006/03/20/556053.aspx">
in the style of a dump file</a>.
Like Doron, you can then let the debugger do the hard work.
</p>
<pre>
C:&gt; ntsd -z contoso.dll
ModLoad: 10000000 10030000   contoso.dll
</pre>
<p>
Now you just ask the debugger,
“Could you disassemble this function for me?”
You give it the broken symbol+offset above.
The debugger looks up the symbol,
applies the offset,
and then <i>looks up the correct symbol</i> when disassembling.
</p>
<pre>

10000e4f5 eb05            jmp     contoso!CReportViewer::ActivateReport+0xf0
</pre>
<p>
Repeat for each broken symbol in the stack trace,
and you have yourself a repaired stack trace.

<p>
Oops, our trick doesn’t work for that first entry in the stack trace,
the one with <code>Ordinal3</code>.
What’s up with that?
There is no function called <code>Ordinal3</code>!
</p>
<p>
If your module exports functions by ordinal without a name,
then the debugger doesn’t know what name to print for the function
(since the name was stripped from the module),
so it just prints the ordinal number.
You will have to go back to your DLL’s <code>DEF</code> file
to convert the ordinal back to a function name.
Or you can
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/13/10164020.aspx">
dump the exports from the DLL
to see what functions match up with what ordinals</a>.
(Of course, for that trick to work, you need to have a matching PDB file
in the symbol search path.)
</p>
<p>
In our example, suppose <code>litware.dll</code> ordinal 3
corresponds to the function
<code>Lit­Debug­Report­Profile</code>.
We would then ask the debugger
</p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; u litware!LitDebugReportProfile+0x6042
<font color="red">litware!CViewFrame::FindInitialFocusControl+0x66</font>:
1000084f5 33db            xor     ebx,ebx
</pre>
<p>
Okay, that takes care of our first oops.
What about the second one?
</p>
<p>
In the second case, the address the debugger was asked to
generate a symbol for came before the first symbol in the module.
In our diagram above, it was in the area marked with question marks.
The debugger has absolutely nothing to work with, so it just
disassembles as relative to the start of the module.
</p>
<p>
To resolve this symbol, you take the offset and add it to the
base of the module as it was loaded into the debugger,
which was reported in the <code>ModLoad</code> output:
</p>
<pre>
ModLoad: <font color="red">10000000</font> 10030000   contoso.dll
</pre>
<p>
If that output scrolled off the screen, you can ask the debugger
to show it again with the help of the <code>lmm</code> command.
</p>
<pre>
0:001&gt;lmm contoso*
start    end        module name
10000000 10030000   contoso    (export symbols)       contoso.dll
</pre>
<p>
Once you have the base address, you
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/25/2265923.aspx">
add the offset back</a>
and ask the debugger what’s there:
</p>
<pre>
0:001&gt; u 0x10000000+0x1d6c
<font color="red">contoso!CViewReportTask::Run+0x102</font>:
100001d6c 50              push    eax
</pre>
<p>
Okay, now that we patched up all our oopses,
we have the full stack trace with symbols:
</p>
<pre>
litware!CViewFrame::FindInitialFocusControl+0x66
litware!CViewFrame::SetInitialKeyboardFocus+0x58
litware!CViewFrame::ActivateViewInFrame+0xf2
contoso!CReportViewer::ActivateReport+0xe9
contoso!CReportViewer::LoadReport+0x12c

</pre>
<p>
Now the fun actually starts:
Figuring out why there was a break in
<code>CView­Frame::Find­Initial­Focus­Control</code>.
Happy debugging!

<b>Bonus tip</b>:
By default,
<code>ntsd</code> does not include line numbers when resolving symbols.
Type <code>.lines</code> to toggle line number support.</p>
