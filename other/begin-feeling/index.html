<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Begin feeling</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A few years ago, the gas station near Microsoft’s main campus (the one which had been <a href="http://jobsblog.com/blog/zeke/"> run by my colleague</a> in a previous stage of his career) appeared to have suffered some problems with the LCD unit on one of its pumps. Instead of “Please insert card”, it said “<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Wosld-Besu-Saodwici.aspx">@leace incebd cabd</a>“. As a geek, I quickly determined that bit 4 got wiped out in the ASCII codes for the characters in the message. Undaunted, I set about going through the usual steps for purchasing gasoline, though it took a little longer than normal because I first had to decode the corrupted strings. And then after I thought I had finished all the necessary preliminaries, the panel said, “Begin Feeling”.</p>
