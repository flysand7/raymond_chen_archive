<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I totally presented to an executive the wrong way</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/gray_knowlton/"> Gray Knowlton</a> wrote an article on <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/gray_knowlton/archive/2010/09/22/how-to-present-to-an-executive.aspx"> how to present to an executive</a>.
 As you might have guessed, I’ve done it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/07/8464281.aspx"> completely the wrong way</a>.
 Many years ago, I was part of a group presenting to a senior-level executive. I was the one who wrote the document establishing the background for the topic and laying out the various options with their pros and cons. I wasn’t the one doing the actual presenting, but I was asked to attend anyway, just in case the senior executive had a question that the presenters couldn’t answer.
 For the duration of the meeting, I sat in the back and knitted.
 As it turns out, I wasn’t needed. But at least I got some knitting done.</p>
<p> (I was commended for the quality of the document I had written, so don’t think I was just blowing off the issue entirely.) </p>
