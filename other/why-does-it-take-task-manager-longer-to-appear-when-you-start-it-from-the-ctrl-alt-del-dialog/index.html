<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does it take Task Manager longer to appear when you start it from the Ctrl+Alt+Del dialog?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://gnobal.net/"> Amit</a> was curious why <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040367"> it takes longer for Task Manager to appear when you start it from the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> dialog</a> compared to launching it from the taskbar.
 Well, you can see the reason right there on the screen: You’re launching it the long way around.
 If you launch Task Manager from the taskbar, Explorer just launches <code>taskmgr.exe</code> via the usual <code>Create­Process</code> mechanism, and Task Manager launches under the same credentials on the same desktop.
 On the other hand, when you use the secure attention sequence, the <code>winlogon</code> program receives the notification, switches to the secure desktop, and displays the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> dialog. When you select <i>Task Manager</i> from that dialog, it then has to launch <code>taskmgr.exe</code>, but it can’t use the normal <code>Create­Process</code> because it’s on the wrong desktop and it’s running under the wrong security context. (Because <code>winlogon</code> runs as SYSTEM, as Task Manager will tell you.)
 Clearly, in order to get Task Manager running on your desktop with your credentials, <code>winlogon</code> needs to change its security context, change desktops, and then launch <code>taskmgr.exe</code>. The desktop switch is probably the slowest part, since it involves the video driver, and video drivers are not known for their blazingly fast mode changes.</p>
<p> It’s like asking why an international package takes longer to deliver than a domestic one. Because it’s starting from further away, and it also has to go through customs. </p>
