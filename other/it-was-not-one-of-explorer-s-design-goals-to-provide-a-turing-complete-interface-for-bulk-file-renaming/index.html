<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It was not one of Explorer's design goals to provide a Turing-complete interface for bulk file renaming</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Somebody wanted to append an extension to all files in a directory
and couldn’t find a way to do this type of bulk rename in Explorer.
On the other hand, it’s pretty simple from the command prompt:
</p>
<pre>
ren * *.ext
</pre>
<p>
The person then asked,
“Can we get this and other multi-file operations added to Explorer?”
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
appending .ext to the name of each file
(for example changing x to x.ext).”
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/05/1211409.aspx#1212132">
changing ABC to XYZ in each name</a>
(for example changing Customer_ABC_History.doc to Customer_XYZ_History.doc).”
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
swapping the first two words in each file name
(for example changing Bob Smith.vcf to Smith, Bob.vcf).”
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
naming each file after the date and time it was created
(for example IMG_2150.JPG becomes Photo December 25, 2004 0735am.JPG).”
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
inserting the word (Provisional)
after the first word
(for example changing Recommendations for Smith account.doc
to Recommendations (Provisional) for Smith account.doc.)”
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/05/28/608979.aspx">
changing the case of each file name</a>
(for example changing Recommendations for Smith account.doc
to Recommendations For Smith Account.doc.)”
(Note that the above case change is incorrect, but computers don’t know that.)
<li>
“There should be a way to rename a large number of files,
inserting the name of the album extracted from the mp3 metadata
before the title
(for example changing
<a>Tick Tock</a>.mp3 to
Beautiful Ride – Tick Tock.mp3.)”
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
It was not one of Explorer’s design goals
to provide a Turing-complete interface for bulk file renaming.
(Remember,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/21/1922203.aspx">
you don’t know what you do until you know what you don’t do</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Explorer does an extremely simple type of bulk rename:
Renumbering a group of files.
If that doesn’t suit your needs, you can use the command prompt.
</p>
<pre>
ren * *.ext
</pre>
<p>
Or you can write a batch file that does some editing before
doing the rename.
</p>
<pre>
for %%i in (*.doc) do call :fancy %%i
goto :eof
:fancy
set _=%1
ren %_% %_:ABC=XYZ%
</pre>
<p>
You can generate a list of files to rename and then load it
into your favorite editor to turn it into a batch file to execute.</p>
<p><pre>
dir /b *.vcf &gt; files.cmd
vi files.cmd
:%s/^\([^ ]*\) \([^ ]*\)\(.*\)/ren "\1 \2\3" "\2 \1\3"
ZZ
files
</pre>
<p>
Or you can write a program in your favorite language that does the
most awesome-fancy renaming the world has ever seen.</p>
