<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Top ten things to do to make your application a Vista application</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> On MSDN, there’s a series of articles on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnlong/html/vistatopten.asp"> the top ten things to do to make your application a Vista application</a>. The series began last December, and just this month, they covered a topic dear to my heart: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnlong/html/AppComp.asp"> Application compatibility</a>. </p>
<p> [Update 2pm: If you have feedback about these articles, posting that feedback here won’t accomplish much since I am not the author of those articles.] </p>
