<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The things in the PDC 2005 introductory video</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I remarked earlier that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/26/456719.aspx"> the creative director for the PDC rummaged through our offices looking for stuff</a> which was to be used in the opening PDC video to decorate a developer’s cubicle. It all flashed by really quickly, but if you were paying attention, you might have been able to make out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">The Art of Computer Programming</a></i> leaning against the tower. </li>
<li><i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/5957.asp">Writing Secure Code</a></i> on the desk. </li>
<li><i><a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=2-0201100886-1">Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools</a></i>,     better known as “The Red Dragon Book”, being used as a monitor stand! </li>
<li>Platters from a broken hard drive used as a decoration. </li>
<li>My letter of appreciation on the wall next to the whiteboard. </li>
<li>A forged diploma with my name on it,     also on the wall next to the whiteboard. </li>
</ul>
<p> One thing you won’t find in the developer’s cubicle, however, is a can of soda. That’s because none of the soda companies would give permission for their product to appear in this video. </p>
<p> Later in the video, several pages from the web site <a href="http://www.tastingmenu.com"> tastingmenu.com</a> are flashed across the screen. Puzzle: Why was this site chosen? </p>
<p> (For legal reasons, I can’t provide a link to the video. Any comments that claim to include a link to the video will be deleted, sorry.) </p>
