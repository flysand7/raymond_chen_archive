<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An anecdote about improper capitalization</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         I’ve already discussed <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/3cfdaedf-2060-4697-b7bf-19205d8448aa">some         of the strange consequences of case-sensitive comparisons</a>.      </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/10/14.html">Joe Beda mentioned         the Internet Explorer capitalization bug that transformed somebody’s name into a dead         body</a>. Allow me to elaborate. You might learn something.      </p>
<p>         This bug occurred because Internet Explorer tried to capitalize the characters in         the name “Yamada” but was not mindful of the character-combining rules of the double-byte         932 character set used for Japanese. In this character set, a single glyph can be         represented either by one or two bytes. The Roman character “A” is represented by         the single byte 0x41. On the other hand, the characters “の” is represented         by the two bytes 0x82 0xCC. (You will need to have Japanese fonts installed to see         the “no” character properly.)      </p>
<p>         When you parse a Japanese string in this character set, you need to maintain state.         If you see a byte that is marked as a “DBCS lead byte”, then it and the byte following         must be treated as a single unit. There is no relationship between the character represented         by 0xE8 0x41 (錢) and 0xE8 0x61 (鐶) even though the second bytes happen         to be related when taken on their own (0x41 = “A” and 0x61 = “a”).      </p>
<p>         Internet Explorer forgot this rule and merely inspected and capitalized each byte         independently. So when it came time to capitalize the characters making up the name         “Yamada”, the second bytes in the pairs were erroneously treated as if they were Roman         characters and “capitalized” accordingly. The result was that the name “Yamada” turned         into the characters meaning “corpse” and “field”. You can imagine how Mr. Yamada felt         about this.      </p>
<p>         Converting the string to Unicode would have helped a little, since the Unicode capitalization         rules would certainly not have connected two unrelated characters in that way. But         there are still risks in character-by-character capitalization: In some languages,         capitalization is itself context-sensitive. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/getwr/steps/wrg_sort.mspx">MSDN         gives as an example</a> that in Hungarian, “SC” and “Sc” are not the same thing when         compared case-insensitively.      </p>
