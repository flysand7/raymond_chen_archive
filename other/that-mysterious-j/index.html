<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">That mysterious J</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In e-mail from Microsoft employees, you may find a stray J <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ricom/first-rate-posting-on-mem-analysis"> like this one at the end of a message from Rico Mariani</a>. Some of you might see it; others might not. What’s the deal with the J?</p>
<p>The J started out its life as a smiley-face. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/wingdings"> WingDings</a> font puts a smiley face where the letter J goes. Here, let me try: <code>&lt;FONT FACE=WingDings&gt;J&lt;/FONT&gt;</code> results in <span style="font-family: WingDings;">J</span>. As the message travels from machine to machine, the font formatting may get lost or mangled, resulting in the letter J appearing when a smiley face was intended. (Note that this is not the same as the smiling face incorporated into Unicode as U+263A, which looks like this: ☺. Some of you might see it; others might not.)</p>
<p>I recall a story (possibly apocryphal) of somebody who regularly exchanged a lot of e-mail with Microsoft employees and who as a result started signing their own messages with a J, figuring this was some sort of Microsoft slang. The Microsoft employees who got the J-messages scratched their heads until they were able to figure out how their correspondent arrived at this fabulous deduction.</p>
<p>And now, the mysterious J has come full circle, because some people use it ironically, intentionally just writing a J without setting the font, in the same way people making fun of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">leet</a>” writing may “accidentally” type “1”s (or even more absurdly, the word “one”) into a row of exclamation points.</p>
