<p>I couldn’t get something to work. The details aren’t important.</p>
<p>I found a very old internal wiki page that listed a long, complicated process for getting the thing to work. I strongly suspected that it wouldn’t help, but out of thoroughness was obligated to give it a try, so that if somebody asked if I tried it, I could say “Yes, and it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>It failed on step 1.</p>
<p>Yay! This is so much better than failing on step 23.</p>
<p>Now I could ask for help with a slightly clearer conscience.</p>
