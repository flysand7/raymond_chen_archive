<p>Sometimes the information you receive regarding the location of a document or other resource is not perfectly correct. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>I put the script on <code>\\<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/07/10171801.aspx">scratch</a>\temp\bob\widgetstuff\enable­widgets.cmd</code>. </p></blockquote>
<p>But then you look, and <i>oh no</i> it’s not there! </p>
<p>Don’t give up yet. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaI6kBVyu00">Look around you</a>. </p>
<p>Maybe the script is in a nearby directory. Maybe Bob misspelled the path or file name. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Got it, thanks. It was actually in a <code>scripts</code> subdirectory, but I was extra smart and figured that out for myself! I deserve a cookie. </p></blockquote>
<p>I have been known to give information that is intentionally ever-so-slightly incorrect in an obvious way (like misspelling a function name or providing the wrong number of parameters), so that the person receiving the information will be forced to look around. </p>
