<p> Here are the descriptions (verbatim) of two job positions open at a major video card manufacturer back in the late 1990’s: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> <b>Software Engineer – Drivers</b> </p>
<p> The way in to a “hot” company in a “hot” field. This entry level position requires some programming experience with graphics preferred. </p>
<p> <b>Senior Software Engineer – Applications (Demos)</b> </p>
<p> This senior position requires considerable experience in 3D graphics or multimedia. Design, specification, and implementation of demos for new products will all be part of the mix. </p>
