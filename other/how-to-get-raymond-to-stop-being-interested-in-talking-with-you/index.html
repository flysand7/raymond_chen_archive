<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to get Raymond to stop being interested in talking with you</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was at a party in New York City earlier this year, and a conversation went like this:</p>
<p> <b>Person</b>: What do you do?<br/> <b>Me</b>: I’m a computer programmer at Microsoft.<br/> <b>Person</b>: &lt;viciously&gt; I hate you.<br/> </p>
<p> If Miss Manners didn’t say so explicitly, I suspect she would nevertheless agree that snarling “I hate you” to somebody on first introduction is not exactly getting off on the right foot. </p>
<p> [Raymond is currently away; this message was pre-recorded.] </p>
