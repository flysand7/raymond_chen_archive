The so-called lyrics to the opening of the     <i>Italian Symphony</i>, as best I can remember them, are as follows:     
<blockquote><p>     Spaghetti! Spaghetti! The meal of Milan,<br/>     With oregano and sourdough and veal parmesan.<br/>     We eat it by night, we it it by day,<br/>     We eat it at work, we eat it at play     And we never get tired,<br/>       No, we never get tired,<br/>       Of the meal,<br/>       Yes, the meal,<br/>       From Milano.     </p></blockquote>

In their zeal to make this article meet length, the editors cut     what I consider to be the most important part of the article!     Here’s the penultimate paragraph in its full unedited version,     with the important part underlined.     
<blockquote class="q"><p>     But wait, there’s still more.     What if you want to access the real 64-bit system directory     from a 32-bit process?     File system redirection will take your attempt to access the     C:\Windows\System32 directory and redirect it to the     C:\Windows\SysWOW64 directory.     Programmatically, you can use functions with unwieldy names like     <code>Wow64­Disable­Wow64­Fs­Redirection</code>,     but those disable redirection for all operations until re-enabled,     which causes trouble if you’re doing anything more complicated     than opening a single file,     because a complex operation may result in multiple files being     accessed and possibly even worker threads being created.     <u>Instead of using a gross switch like disabling file system redirection,     you can use the special C:\Windows\SysNative virtual directory.     When a 32-bit process tries to access the C:\Windows\SysNative     directory, the operations are redirected to the real     C:\Windows\System32 directory.     A local solution to a local problem.</u> </p></blockquote>
