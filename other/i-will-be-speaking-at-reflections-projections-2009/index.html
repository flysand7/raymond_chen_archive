<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I will be speaking at Reflections|Projections 2009</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/12/7626236.aspx"> The way to get me to show up at your conference is to invite me</a>. The folks who run the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/index.html"> Reflections|Projections 2009 conference</a> figured that out. I will be there on Friday the 16th for the job fair in the Siebel Atrium, and my talk <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/chen.html"> <i>How Microsoft is Different from School</i></a> is scheduled for Saturday morning at 11:15. Attendance is free, but that’s not much consolation seeing as you first have to <i>get there</i>.
 It’s always a weird situation I find myself in when I’m invited to give a talk at a conference, because if I give a talk on the stuff I usually write about, you’ll get something like a one-hour discussion of the finer points of programming scrollbars. (A talk not even I would attend.) As a result, conference talks always take me a bit “out of my element”, forcing me to pick some topic I don’t usually talk about which still fits in with the overall tone of the other talks.
 Reflections|Projections is particularly scary for me, because, I mean, look at the other speakers: <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/ohanian.html"> The co-founder of reddit</a>. <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/tsuk.html"> Principal Architect for webOS</a>. <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/gregori.html"> Author of the Robot Vision Toolkit</a>. And the topics: <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/karra.html"> Cloud computing</a>, <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/chang.html"> Google Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/fitz_sussman.html"> the myth of the genius programmer</a>. These people do big things, and these topics are big topics.
 On the other hand, I do small things.
 It took me a while to find a topic, and then once I found it, I had to do a bunch of research because, well, it’s been a long time since I was in school. I interviewed a bunch of colleagues who came to Microsoft directly out of school within the past two years to steal^H^H^H^H^Hdraw upon their experiences and then put the stories together into a talk. If you think about it, for this subject matter, I’m going to be a total poser!
 We’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p> (Actually, it’s not <i>total</i> poser-tude, since I do have personal knowledge of how things are done at Microsoft. The provocative title is just a hook.) </p>
