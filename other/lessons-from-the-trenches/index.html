<p>     Lessons I learned from working in product support the past few days:      </p>
<ul>
<li>             If the husband is in the room, hope that he leaves. (He will second-guess everything             you do.)          </li>
<li>             If there’s a 14-year-old in the room, hope the parents give the phone to him/her.             (Teenagers type a lot faster.)          </li>
<li>             Hope you get a grandma.  They’re not the fastest typists in the world, but they’re             so sweet you don’t mind.          </li>
<li>             If they don’t have a second phone line for their computer, ask if they have a cell             phone.  Call them on the cell phone so you can talk them through the rest of             the steps.          </li>
<li>             Get a binaural headset as soon as possible.          </li>
</ul>
