<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The peculiar appeal of the Baseball Uncyclopedia</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> NPR’s <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/"> <i>Only a Game</i></a> <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/shows/2006/02/20060225_8.asp"> interviewed the authors of <i>The Baseball Uncyclopedia</i></a>, an irreverent guide to our national pastime, and <a href="http://download.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/330/510052/5230740/WBUR_5230740.mp3"> it was a blast to listen to</a>. The two authors clearly are huge baseball fans, but they bring to it a fascination not with mind-numbing statistics but with the deep history of the sport. (Plus the fact that they disagree on many things, which leads to really funny arguments.) And who can’t appreciate the theory that Kevin Costner is responsible for Shoeless Joe Jackson not being in the Baseball Hall of Fame?</p>
