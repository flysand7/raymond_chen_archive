<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can’t you drop directly onto a taskbar button?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
If you drag a object and drop it onto a taskbar button, you get
an error message that says,
</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p>
You cannot drop an item onto a button on the taskbar.
</p>
<p>
However, if you drag the item over a button without releasing
the mouse button, the window will open after a moment,
allowing you to drop the item inside the window.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn’t the taskbar let you drop directly onto a taskbar
button?
</p>
<p>
Ideally, if the taskbar receives a IDropTarget::Drop,
it could do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
// imaginary code
IDropTarget *pdt;
if (SUCCEEDED(GetDropTargetFromWindow(hwndButton, &amp;pdt))) {
  pdt-&gt;Drop(…);
  pdt-&gt;Release();
}
</pre>
<p>
(Warning: I said “something like” this.  Forwarding a drop is
actually more complicated than this.)
</p>
<p>
The reason why the taskbar doesn’t do this is that there is no such
function GetDropTargetFromWindow function.
The taskbar can’t forward the drop operation even if it wanted to.
</p>
<p>
Why is there no GetDropTargetFromWindow function?  I have no idea.
You’ll have to ask the OLE folks.
If I had to guess
(and I know I have to because you folks will just keep badgering me
until I come up with a guess),
it’s because that would create the problem of how to
prevent somebody from screwing with a program by
grabbing its drop target and never releasing it.
</p>
<p>
Now of course people will criticize my explanation, so I’m going to
say it again: <strong>I don’t know the answer. I’m just guessing.
My guess is probably wrong.</strong>
