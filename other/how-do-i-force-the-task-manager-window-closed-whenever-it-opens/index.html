<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I force the Task Manager window closed whenever it opens?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to close (or at least hide) the Task Manager window whenever it opens. They did so by setting a timer and periodically running this code: </p>
<pre>
void FindAndCloseTaskManager()
{
  HWND taskManagerWindow = FindWindow(nullptr, "Windows Task Manager");
  if (taskManagerWindow) {
    PostMessage(taskManagerWindow, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>This code worked on Windows 7, but stopped working on Windows 8. </p>
<p>Well, yeah, because you’re searching for a window by name. The name of the Task Manager window in Windows 7 was <i>Windows Task Manager</i>: </p>

<p>On the other hand, in Windows 8, the window was named simply <i>Task Manager</i>. </p>

<p>And of course, those names apply only to English. If the user’s UI language is German, the name will be <i>Task-Manager</i> with a hyphen. </p>
<p>Whether a user can or cannot run Task Manager is an administrative decision, not an application decision. Use the “Remove Task Manager” group policy.  </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Note that if this customer had their way, the name of Task Manager would be a compatibility constraint. </p>
<p><b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>: Don’t think you can rely on the window class name either. <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070725-00/?p=25863">That is also subject to change</a>. </p>
