<p>On occasion, I make a typo and get “JavaScript error: Semicolon expected” and I chuckle a little, because JavaScript was designed to <a href="http://www.bradoncode.com/blog/2015/08/26/javascript-semi-colon-insertion/"> make semicolons optional</a> most of the time.</p>
<p>When I made this observation, some of my friends were amused because I included the phrase “JavaScript was designed.”</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html"> JavaScript was announced 25 years ago today</a>. Happy birthday.</p>
