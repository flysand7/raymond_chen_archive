<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Whimsical bug reports</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         Whimsical bug reports, while not a common occurence, aren’t exactly unheard of either.         They are a popular way to vent a shared frustration and lighten the mood.      </p>
<p>         Recently, we changed milk suppliers for our cafeterias. Well, more accurately, our         previous milk supplier was bought by another milk company. The problem is that the         single-serving milk cartons from the new company are hard to open.      </p>
<p>         So of course what you do is file a bug.      </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>         Bug: New milk cartons are hard to open.      </p>
<p>     Repro: Go to cafeteria, get milk carton, attempt to open it, get napkins and clean     up mess. </p></blockquote>
<p>         (The reason is that the milk company bought a brand new machine which seals the cartons         with too much glue. They are working to adjust the seal.)      </p>
<p>         A few work-arounds were suggested, including bringing your own cow and a three-step         process of freezing the milk, tearing the carton open, then allowing the milk to thaw.         Others explain that the fix is held up in testing: “Currently only 3 testers are handling         this component and they can only drink 8 cartons a day. The team could conduct more         carton-opening tests but carton-tasting, milkflow testing and carton pressure tests         are still remaining.” Plus of course a security review needs to be made of the consequences         of a weaker seal.      </p>
<p>         This is a particularly software-oriented joke, because it highlights how hard it is         to make bugfixes in software – by applying the software testing regimen to something         that isn’t software. You can’t assume that a simple, local change like adjusting the         amount of glue applied to the carton will result in a simple, local change in the         final product (a more acceptable seal strength). Software is nonlinear. A simple change         can have effects (some catastrophic, some subtle) far, far away from the point of         change.      </p>
