<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">This code would be a lot faster if it weren’t for the synchronization</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
This is a story from a friend of a friend,
which makes it probably untrue, but I still like the story.
</p>
<p>
One of my colleagues jokingly suggested that we could speed up
our code by adding these lines to our project
</p>
<pre>
#define EnterCriticalSection(p) ((void)0)
#define LeaveCriticalSection(p) ((void)0)
</pre>
<p>
I replied, “You think you’re joking, but you’re not.”
</p>
<p>
According to legend, there was a project whose product
was running too slow,
so they spun off a subteam to see what architectural changes
would help them improve their performance.
The subteam returned some time later with a fork of the project
that they had “tuned”.
And it was indeed the case that the performance-tuned version
ran a lot faster.
</p>
<p>
Later, the development team discovered that part of the “tuning”
involved simply deleting all the synchronization.
They didn’t replace it with lock-free algorithms
or anything that clever.
They just removed all the critical sections.
