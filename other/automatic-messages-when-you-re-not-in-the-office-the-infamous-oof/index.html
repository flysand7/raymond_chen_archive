<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Automatic messages when you're not in the office – the infamous OOF</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>“OOF” is a word you hear a lot at Microsoft. <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/"> KC Lemson</a> gave the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/archive/2003/09/25/53795.aspx"> etymology</a> a while back (though my recollection is that it stood for “Out of Office Feature”, not that my memory is good for much nowadays). Incidentally, KC is <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/epdb/profileDetailPage.aspx?profileId=72"> profiled on the Microsoft Careers site</a>, though she goes under the top-secret code name “KC” there.
 Most people set their “vacation” message to something pretty straightforward. A brief message, a return date, and a flowchart of who can be contacted in the meantime.  Here’s what one might look like. (For the sake of illustration, I made up a  “<a href="http://www.sjbaker.org/teapot/">Teapot</a> project” as well some imaginary members and team mailing list. I did not make up “Kansas”, however. Believe it or not, that’s <a href="http://www.accesskansas.org/">a real state</a>!)</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  In Kansas until March 3, checking email sporadically.   Teapot shading: Fred Smith<br/> Teapot rotation: Bob Wilson<br/> Teapot general: tpteam<br/> Emergency: 425.555.9595 </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The OOF is an opportunity for small-form-factor humor. When he left on holiday at the end of December, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/marcmill/"> Marc Miller</a>‘s OOF message introduced the “flowchart” section with the heading “These people are probably also OOF”. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/"> Jensen Harris</a>‘s OOF earlier this year read</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Out of office, Thursday March 31. Back on Friday.<br/> If you are injured, dial 911. </p></blockquote>
<p> (But don’t call 911 for a non-emergency like <a href="http://www.snopes.com/crime/cops/burger.asp">this lady</a>. On the other hand, KC called 911 because <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/archive/2006/01/13/417426.aspx"> she couldn’t get out of bed</a>.)
 As for me, I try to keep my OOF under twenty words. Part of the trick is getting rid of the “flowchart”. I remember one time I simply wrote “Returning dd-mmm-yy. You’ll just have to cope until then.”</p>
<p> The “flowchart” section of the OOF is one of those places where beginners go overboard, listing a half dozen topics and the corresponding backup. It’s a sort of ego trip, where you can quietly show off, “Wow, look at all the things I do. How would you ever survive without me?” As with email signatures and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx"> the amassing of physical objects</a>, the more seasoned you become, the more you value the ability to keep it short and simple. </p>
