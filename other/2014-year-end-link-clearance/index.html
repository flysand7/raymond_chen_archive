<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">2014 year-end link clearance</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Another round of the semi-annual link clearance. </p>
<ul>
<li>    Do you hear any Christmas music right now? Good.    Christmas songs can be played    only 1/12 of the year, and    <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/christmas-music-season-data/">    people who write algorithms    for computer-generated playlists    need to identify Christmas songs</a>    so that they don’t select them during the other 11/12 of the year.    Also, so that when Christmas standards suddenly become popular,    they don’t decide that Bing Crosby is an up-and-coming artist.    (The article also talks about the arms race among    stations which switch to playing only Christmas songs    during the holiday season.) </li>
<li>     Your Bank of America debit or credit card     gets you     <a href="http://museums.bankofamerica.com/">     free admission to a variety of museums     around the country on the first weekend     of the month</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/12/letterman_top_ten_a_statistical_analysis_of_30_years_of_top_ten_lists_from.html">     A statistical analysis of 30 years of David Letterman’s Top Ten Lists</a>.     What takes this beyond your basic “I generated a lot of graphs”     article is the involvement of     Joe Toplyn, one of Letterman’s writers, to help explain the results. </li>
<li>     The TSA’s controversial     <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/advanced-imaging-technology-ait">     millimeter-wave Advanced Imaging Technology</a>     scanners (aka “nudie scanners”)     were taken out of service last year,     but what happened to them?     <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140520/08421227293/expensive-tsa-nudie-scanners-find-new-home-prisons.shtml">     They went to prisons</a>.     If they had been available for sale to the general public,     I’m pretty sure all of them would have been bought by     fraternities.     For security purposes, I assure you.     (Actually, the occasional unit appears to be     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rapiscan+backscatter">     put up for sale on eBay</a>.     Earlier this year, one went up for     <a href="http://www.loweringthebar.net/2014/12/assorted-stupidity-68.html">     $8000 from a government-surplus reseller</a>.     Today, there is a     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/111519265986">     $3,995 or best offer</a>.) </li>
<li>The SpaceX project’s Falcon 9     landed successfully,     but the video captured from the lander was     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8H8OlJ3o8">badly corrupted</a>.     The folks at the NASA Space Flight Forums     <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/06/recovering-falcon-9-ocean-landing-video-done/">     accepted the challenge to recover as much as possible</a>     and the results are amazing.     Don’t watch the     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZ33C9JZTM">     reconstructed video</a> until you’ve seen     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8H8OlJ3o8">the original</a>. </li>
<li>     The air traffic control service     <a href="http://nats.aero/">NATS</a>     runs the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area,     a large chunk of the north Atlantic west of Great Britain.     They produced this     <a href="http://nats.aero/blog/2014/06/north-atlantic-skies-gateway-europe/">     mesmerizing video</a>     of air traffic over the north Atlantic in a single day.     They have also produced     <a href="http://nats.aero/blog/2014/03/europe-24-air-traffic-data-visualisation/">     24 hours over Europe</a>     and     <a href="https://vimeo.com/90787669">     24 hours over the Middle East</a>. </li>
<li>     The mellifluous tones of Stephen Fry     <a href="http://www.lords.org/lawsanimations">     elucidate the laws of cricket</a>.     The problem I have with a lot of this introductory material     is that they tend to get all bogged down in details that     are not relevant to an appreciation of the game.     For example,     <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket/equipment.html">     the precise composition of the bat and ball are not important</a>.     You can assume for the most part     that the bats and balls conform     to applicable regulations.     Here’s something never before asked in the history of cricket:     “I didn’t understand what just happened.     Can you tell me the number of pieces of leather which comprise     the ball covering?”     (Someday, I will try to write “The rules of ⟨sport⟩     for the casual viewer.”) </li>
<li> <a href="http://aneurismic.tumblr.com/post/87185178513/seattle2">     Judgmental map of Seattle</a>. </li>
<li>     AHL (hockey) referee David Banfield     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEBoOr12BrI">     wears a GoPro helmet cam on the job</a>.     I’m impressed by how much effort is expended     trying to defuse situations before they turn into fights.     Or at least before they turn into bigger fights     than they already are.     “Good job boys, good job.”     It’s like he’s managing a group of toddlers.     (NHL referee Wes McCauley     <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-official-wes-mccauley-mic-d-yankee-stadium-214512005--nhl.html">     did the same thing a month later</a>, but the result of the editing     was less insightful.) </li>
<li>     The first     <a href="http://www.ethicsinsports.ch/">     World Summit on Ethics in Sport</a>     was hosted by FIFA.     (Motto: “We will not give up until we are more corrupt than the IOC!”)     <a href="http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/homefifa/news/newsid=2423590/index.html">     I am not making this up</a>. </li>
<li>     The IOC responds by     <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html">     making absurd demands from the City of Oslo     for hosting the Winter Games</a>.     I like how they backpedal and say,     “Oh no, those weren’t demands.     They were merely suggestions!”     Let’s look at one of those suggestions:     “All IOC members shall receive a new mobile phone with     Norwegian service.     The phone must be Samsung brand.”     That sure is an oddly-phrased suggestion. </li>
<li>FIFA strikes back:     <a href="http://deadspin.com/fifa-investigator-blasts-report-based-on-his-own-invest-1658279291">     FIFA Investigator Blasts Report Based On His Own Investigation</a>.     Or, the headline as FIFA would have written it:     “FIFA cleared of all wrongdoing in FIFA-sponsored investigation     of FIFA, says FIFA.”     <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fifa-ethics-investigator-garcia-resigns-161558043--sow.html">     Garcia later resigned in protest</a>. </li>
<li>The IAAF says, “Hey don’t forget us! We’re corrupt too!”     <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/25/iaaf-doha-incentive-fair-world-athletics-2019">     IAAF insists Dohas £23.5m last-minute incentive was totally fair</a>. </li>
</ul>
