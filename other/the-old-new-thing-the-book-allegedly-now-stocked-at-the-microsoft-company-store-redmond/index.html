<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Old New Thing (the book) allegedly now stocked at the Microsoft Company Store (Redmond)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve been informed that the Redmond branch of the Microsoft Company Store has begun stocking the dead tree edition of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> my book</a>.
 “But wait, your program isn’t printed by Microsoft Press; it’s published by Addison-Wesley Professional. I thought the company store only stocked Microsoft Press titles.”
 I’m told that this is a pilot program. (And no, I don’t know what the success criteria are.)
 When I stopped by the store a few days ago, they were in the process of reorganizing the book section, so not only was my book not up, neither were any others! But it should be there “any day now.”</p>
<p> And remember, I’ll gladly sign your book <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/31/1565656.aspx"> but you have to tell me what to write</a>. </p>
