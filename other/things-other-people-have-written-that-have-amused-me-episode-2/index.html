<p>Somebody posted a time-saving tip and concluded with “You’ll save yourself at least 5 minutes per year.”
 I jokingly wrote back, “I already do XYZ which does this automatically, and besides, saving 5 minutes per year isn’t much anyway. I spend that much time picking my nose.”</p>
<p> The response: “Yeah, but now you can do both nostrils.” </p>
