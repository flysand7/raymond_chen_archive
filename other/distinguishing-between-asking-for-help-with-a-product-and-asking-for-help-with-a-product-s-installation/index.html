<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Distinguishing between asking for help with a product and asking for help with a product's installation</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Internally at Microsoft, we have a programmer’s tool which I will call <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/16/9551818.aspx"> Program Q</a>. On the peer-to-peer mailing list for Program Q, somebody asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> What’s the best way to look at all tables created in the past week? I want to repeat this command across multiple table repositories. </p></blockquote>
<p> Somebody chimed in with the answer.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> You are looking for something like <code>q find table -age lt 7d</code>. If you want to repeat across multiple table repositories, you would say <code>q -server xxx find table -age lt 7d</code>, replacing <code>xxx</code> with the  table repository server name. </p></blockquote>
<p> This seemed to work, but there was a follow-up question:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> What’s the best way to get the repository server name for any given repository? For example, what are all the repository servers used by my test team? Is there a central database I can query? </p></blockquote>
<p> To get the repository servers used by your test team, you um ask your test team?
 The people on the <i>Program Q peer-to-peer help</i> mailing list do not know the names of your test team’s repository servers. There is no central database of all Program Q servers.</p>
<p> It’s like asking, “What’s the best way to get the name of somebody’s SharePoint site?” Answer: You ask them, “Hey, what’s the name of your SharePoint site?” SharePoint itself does not maintain a central database of all SharePoint sites, but your test team might have a policy that all new SharePoint sites should be registered in some central database. You’ll need to ask them. </p>
