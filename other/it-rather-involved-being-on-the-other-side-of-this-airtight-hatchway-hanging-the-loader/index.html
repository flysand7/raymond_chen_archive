<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway: Hanging the loader</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A security vulnerability report pointed out that a malicious file can cause the module loader to enter an infinite loop, thereby causing a denial of service on the process doing the loading. </p>
<p>This was by itself not interesting. After all, if you have managed to get the system to attempt to load your DLL, and you want to use it to cause a denial of service, then you don’t need to get this fancy. You can just put <code>Sleep(INFINITE);</code> in your <code>DLL_</code><code>PROCESS_</code><code>ATTACH</code> handler! </p>
<p>In other words, you’re already on the other side of the airtight hatchway. And you’re bragging that you can do something annoying like a denial service, apparently unaware that being on the other side of the airtight hatchway gives you the ability to do far more interesting (and threatening) things. </p>
