<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Internet Explorer put tab stops at 8-character intervals instead of 4, like all right-thinking people?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you embed a TAB character (U+0009) in a &lt;PRE&gt; block (or more precisely, an element whose <code>white-space</code> CSS property is computed to be <code>pre</code> or <code>pre-wrap</code>), Internet Explorer will move the current position to the next multiple of eight characters. Many people prefer four. (Some <i>insist</i> that only four is the correct value and anybody who disagrees with them is simply wrong.)
 Why eight?
 Because that’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#white-space-model"> what the standard says</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> All tabs (U+0009) are rendered as a horizontal shift that lines up the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop. Tab stops occur at points that are multiples of 8 times the width of a space (U+0020) rendered in the block’s font from the block’s starting content edge.  </p></blockquote>
<p> Note that the standard does not provide an extensibility point to customize the position of tab stops. The number eight is hard-coded into the standard. If you don’t like that, then don’t use tabs. (There appears to be a draft proposal to add a <code>tab-size</code> property to control this, but nothing standard yet, at least not at the time I originally wrote this article.)</p>
<p> Okay, but why did the standard pick eight as the tab stop interval? I don’t know (never having attended any CSS standardization meetings), but I suspect they were observing existing practice. For reasons unknown even to Wikipedia, teletypewriter tab stops were historically placed at eight-column intervals. </p>
