<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The WMI root node is just a node in the WMI namespace</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A security vulnerability report arrived that went roughly like this: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>There is a serious zero-day security vulnerability in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742610.aspx">the <code>WMIC.EXE</code> program</a>. It does not check whether the user has administrative privileges before granting access. Simply sign in as a standard user and run the <code>wmic</code> program. Observe from the prompt that it gives you root access. </p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; del config.sys
Access is denied

C:\&gt; wmic
wmic:root\cli&gt; cdrom get description, drive
Description   Drive
CD-ROM Drive  D:
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The WMIC prompt looks like this: </p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt;
</pre>
<p>This is telling you that your current location (which WMI calls a <i>role</i> for some reason) is the <code>cli</code> node in the root of the WMI namespace. You can change this by typing </p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt; /ROLE:..\cimv2
wmic:root\cimv2&gt;
</pre>
<p>We suspect that the finder saw the word <i>root</i> and assumed it had the same meaning here as it does in Unix. In Windows, the administrator account is called <i>Administrator</i>, not <i>root</i>. </p>
<p>Their screen shot shows that they don’t have administrator privileges when they started (because they can’t delete the file <code>C:\config.sys</code>). From inside the <code>WMIC</code> tool, they printed information about the CD-ROM drives, but that operation doesn’t require administrator privileges, so that isn’t proof that any elevation occurred. </p>
<p>Running the <code>WMIC</code> program doesn’t change your security level. If you don’t have administrator privileges, then you still cannot do things like, say, delete system files. </p>
<pre>
wmic:root\cli&gt;datafile where name="C:\\config.sys" delete
Delete '\\PC\ROOT\CIMV2:CIM_DataFile.Name="c:\\config.sys"' (Y/N/?)? y
Deleting instance \\PC\ROOT\CIMV2:CIM_DataFile.Name="c:\\config.sys"
ERROR:
Description = Access denied
