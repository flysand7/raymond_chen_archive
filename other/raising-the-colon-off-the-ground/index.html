<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raising the colon off the ground</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s a fine typographical detail in the Windows 8 TDBN. <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180829-00/?p=99595">See if you can spot it</a>. </p>
<p>In the clock, it says 7∶00. </p>
<p>Not 7:00. </p>
<p>The colon between the hour and minutes has been raised slightly. </p>
<p>People that care a lot about these things prevailed upon the development team to make this small refinement to the clock on the TDBN as well as the clock on the taskbar. </p>
<p>Of course, the globalization team had their own concerns about this, because the time separator is not always a colon. And even if it is, changing the character from U+003A to U+2236 would affect right-to-left layout because U+003A is category CS (common number separator) whereas U+2236 is character ON (other neutral), which would result in “7:00” rendering incorrectly as “00:7”. </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>HTML</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;DIV DIR="rtl"&gt;7:00&lt;/DIV&gt;</code></td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;DIV DIR="rtl"&gt;7∶00&lt;/DIV&gt;</code></td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Furthermore, in languages like Chinese, the U+2236 is wider than U+003A, resulting in too much white space on either side. </p>
<p>A compromise was reached: The colon would be raised off the ground, but only if the current locale uses Latin script. The accessibility name continues to use U+003A so that screen readers will still read the time correctly. </p>
<p>Even though TDBN disappeared in Windows 10, the refinements to the the way time is displayed still exist in the taskbar clock. </p>
<p>Which you probably never noticed, unless you’re a typography nerd. </p>
