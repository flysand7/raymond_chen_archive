<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Yahoo's privacy policy regarding web bugs</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Here’s  <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/pixels/details.html">  Yahoo’s privacy policy regarding so-called web bugs  (or as they call them “web beacons”)</a> – these are the little 1×1  images that web sites use to keep track of where you’re going.
  Halfway down the page (at least as of the time I wrote this,  which is not the same as the time this gets posted since I write  stuff in advance…) in the section “Outside the Yahoo! Network”  there is a link to opt out of sharing the information with companies  outside the Yahoo! Network.
  Maybe it’s time to start surfing with images off again, or perhaps  somebody can write a plug-in that blocks all 1×1 images.</p>
