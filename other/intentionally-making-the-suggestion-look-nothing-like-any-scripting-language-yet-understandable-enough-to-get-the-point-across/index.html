<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Intentionally making the suggestion look nothing like any scripting language, yet understandable enough to get the point across</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In an internal peer-to-peer discussion list for an internal tool I’ll call <i>Program Q</i>, somebody asked, </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>How can I query the number of free frobs in every table in my table repository? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suggested that they could use the command </p>
<pre>
q query-property "*::frobs-free"
</pre>
<p>taking advantage of the fact that in Program Q, you can specify a wildcard for the table name to query across all tables. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Thanks, this looks promising, but my repository has a huge number of tables, so the <code>q query-property</code> command refuses to expand the <code>*</code> wildcard that much. I can get around this by issuing 26 queries, one for each letter of the alphabet: </p>
<pre>
q query-property "a*::frobs-free"
q query-property "b*::frobs-free"
q query-property "c*::frobs-free"
...
q query-property "z*::frobs-free"
</pre>
<p>Is there a better way to do this? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied with some pseudocode. </p>
<pre>
(
  from table in `q list-tables`
  select table + "::frobs-free"
) | q query-property @-
</pre>
<p>(The <code>@</code> means that it should take the list of properties from a file, and we give <code>-</code> as the file name, meaning standard input. Not that it’s important because <i>I completely made this up</i>.) </p>
<p>A colleague of mine noted that I provided just enough syntax to explain the algorithm clearly, but in a form that cannot be executed in any scripting language, so the user understands that it is just an algorithm that needs to be massaged into something that will actually run. </p>
<p>It’s a neat trick when it works. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/16/9551818.aspx">But when it fails, it fails spectacularly</a>. Fortunately, in this case, it worked. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: For all I know, that’s valid PowerShell. </p>
