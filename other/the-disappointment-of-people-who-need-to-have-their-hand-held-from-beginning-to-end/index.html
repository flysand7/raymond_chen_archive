<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The disappointment of people who need to have their hand held from beginning to end</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some customers already have the answer but need to have their hand held.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  My customer wants to enforce a company-wide policy of disabling the “Keep the taskbar on top of other windows” feature. We have confirmed that there is no group policy setting for controlling this setting. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/06/415158.aspx"> Further research reveals the <code>SHAppBarMessage</code> function</a>. The customer wants to know if there is any way he can write code that will use this function to modify the setting. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer found a map to a stream, saw that there were directions printed on it, and then asked, “Is there any way I can follow these directions and get some water?”
 The product team dutifully wrote up the four-line function to do the work the customer requested—call <code>SHAppBarMessage</code> with <code>ABM_GETSTATE</code> to get the current state, turn off the <code>ABM_ALWAYSONTOP</code> flag, and then call it again with <code>ABM_SETSTATE</code> to apply the changes—but it still frustrates me that we had to deal with this question in the first place.
 It’s one thing to say, “I tried doing X and it didn’t work. Here’s the code I was using.” It’s another thing to say, “I discovered function X. Can you write code for me?”</p>
<p> No lesson today. Just venting. </p>
