<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Destroying the module and resource information associated with an icon</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
We’ve seen that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/20/8880062.aspx">
icons and cursors know where they came from</a>,
and the window manager uses this information when you ask it
to change the size of an icon.
But not all icons carry this information,
only icons created by passing a <code>HINSTANCE</code> and
a resource name.
</p>
<p>
You can use this to your advantage if you want to destroy
the module and resource information associated with an icon.
For example, the <code>CreateIconIndirect</code> function
creates an icon from raw bitmap information without reference
to an <code>HINSTANCE</code> or a resource name.
This allows you to create icons at runtime, but it also allows
you to create an icon that “throws away” the bonus information.
</p>
<pre>
HICON CopyIconWithoutResourceInfo(HICON hicoSrc)
{
  ICONINFO ii;
  HICON hico = NULL;
  if (GetIconInfo(hicoSrc, &amp;ii)) {
    hico = CreateIconIndirect(&amp;ii);
    if (ii.hbmMask) DeleteObject(ii.hbmMask);
    if (ii.hbmColor) DeleteObject(ii.hbmColor);
  }
  return hico;
}
</pre>
<p>
Now, throwing away this information is a desperation move,
because it prevents the window manager from using the original
resource information when resizing an icon,
resulting in ugly stretched icons.
</p>
<p>
You might even be throwing this information away by mistake.
For example, if your program is asked to produce an icon,
it’s best if you load the icon with a function like
<code>LoadImage</code> because that records the bonus information;
if the caller decides to resize the icon, it can do so with the
<code>CopyImage</code> function while retaining full fidelity.
On the other hand, if you use a function like
<code>ExtractIcon</code> or <code>CreateIconFromResource</code>,
that will not have the bonus information, and any icon stretching
that takes place will end up looking pretty ugly.
