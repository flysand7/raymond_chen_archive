<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Excellent blog about Windows and Unicode</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/">Michael Kaplan</a> has probably forgotten more about Unicode than most people know. He knows about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/14/284838.aspx"> the mysterious placement of the Won character in the Korean character set</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/14/307152.aspx"> and the same for the Japanese Yen character</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/archive/2004/12/08/278170.aspx"> what the invariant locale is</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/michkap/archive/2004/11/30/272207.aspx"> why Korean text sorts strangely if you pass the NORM_IGNORENONSPACE flag</a>, and other strange and wonderful dark corners of keyboard layouts, character sets, and collation. </p>
<p> Around Microsoft, Michael is <strong>the</strong> local authority on Unicode. It’s great that he’s sharing his deep knowledge with the rest of us. (Note: I said “local” authority. Just because he’s our main guy doesn’t mean that he’s your primary contact, too.) </p>
