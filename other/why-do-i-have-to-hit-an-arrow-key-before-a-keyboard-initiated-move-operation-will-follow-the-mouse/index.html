 I don’t know, but I think it’s just a bug. Mind you, it’s a bug with extraordinary seniority (probably going as far back as Windows 1.0).</p>
<p> The Move and Size commands from the system menu are operated by the same common function, and the keyboard-initiated Size command requires you to hit an arrow in order to specify which edge you are trying to resize. The Move command doesn’t need to let you pick a side (since moving is independent of sides), but the common helper function waits for the arrow key regardless of the underlying operation. </p>
