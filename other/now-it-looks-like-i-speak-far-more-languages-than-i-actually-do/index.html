<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Now it looks like I speak far more languages than I actually do</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The folks over at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/"> <i>TechNet Magazine</i></a> have done something really cool: They’ve started translating all their articles into <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=es"> Spanish</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=fr"> French</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=de"> German</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=ru"> Russian</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=pt"> Brazilian Portuguese</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/?loc=zh"> Simplified Chinese</a>. (But no Swedish.) You can change your language on the fly with the combo box in the corner. (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/11/"><i>MSDN Magazine</i></a> is doing the same thing. It’s an epidemic!)
 They did such a thorough job, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/11/WindowsConfidential/default.aspx?loc=de"> they even translated my screenshot</a>! (Though they forgot to adjust the picture size. Hey, they’re still new at this. Give them time.) And by a stroke of synchronicity, they first article of mine to get this treatment is one that even mentions the hard work that goes into translating Windows…</p>
<p> (Note: I didn’t get to see the translations ahead of time, so something may have been lost along the way. For example, in the German version, I don’t think “dass unser Programm schlecht aussieht” quite captures what I was trying to say. Something more like “ein schlechtes Licht auf unser Programm zu werfen.” I don’t blame the translators, though. How were they to know that I was talking more figuratively than literally?) </p>
