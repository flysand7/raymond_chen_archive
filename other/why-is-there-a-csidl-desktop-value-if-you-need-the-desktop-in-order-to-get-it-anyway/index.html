<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is there a CSIDL_DESKTOP value if you need the desktop in order to get it anyway?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
John asks
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/07/30/9852685.aspx#9853402">
why there is a special constant <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP</code>
defined for the desktop</a>.
After all, in order to use <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP</code>,
you need to call <code>SHGet­Desktop­Folder</code> and then
bind to it.
What’s the point of having an <code>ITEM­ID­LIST</code> that
represents the desktop if, in order to use it,
you first need to get the desktop?
</p>
<p>
It’s like asking why the file system uses
<code>.</code> (dot)
to refer to the current directory.
You’re already <i>in</i> the current directory.
In order to resolve <code>.</code> (dot), you already need to have
the current directory, so why bother with the dot at all?
</p>
<p>
Because it is often convenient to give a name to your starting point.
</p>
<p>
Suppose somebody wants to save a file to the desktop.
How would you represent this as an <code>ITEM­ID­LIST</code>?
If the only thing you can do is fill in the blank in the
sentence,
“Start with the desktop folder, then go to ________, then
save the file there,”
then you need a way to say “where you are now.”
</p>
<p>
And that’s what <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP</code> gives you.
An <code>ITEM­ID­LIST</code> that says “Where you are now.”
</p>
<p>
Besides, if <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP</code> weren’t defined,
somebody would have invented it.
Say your program has a list of directories it wants to operate on,
say, the Documents folder, the Music folder,
and the Shared Documents folder.
Great, so let me write a function:
</p>
<pre>
void DoItIn(HWND hwnd, int csidl)
{
 PIDLIST_ABSOLUTE pidl;
 if (SUCCEEDED(SHGetSpecialFolderLocation(
                     hwnd, csidl, &amp;pidl))) {
  IShellFolder *psf;
  if (SUCCEEDED(SHBindToObject(NULL, pidl, NULL,
                    IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;psf)))) {
   ...
   psf-&gt;Release();
  }
  CoTaskMemFree(pidl);
 }
}
void DoItInStandardPlaces(HWND hwnd)
{
 const static int csidls[] = {
  CSIDL_MYDOCUMENTS,
  CSIDL_MYMUSIC,
  CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS,
 };
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARRAYSIZE(csidls); i++) {
  DoItIn(hwnd, csidls[i]);
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Now you want to add the desktop folder.
Oh wait, there is no <code>CSIDL</code> value for the desktop,
so I’ll have to make one up.
</p>
<pre>
// Our custom CSIDLs use the high word. None of the CSIDLs we use
// set any bits in the high word, so we can use the high word to
// detect whether we have a standard CSIDL or a custom CSIDL.
#define CUSTOMCSIDL_DESKTOP 0x00010000
#define ISCUSTOMCSIDL(csidl) HIWORD(csidl)
#define STANDARDCSIDLOF(csidl) LOWORD(csidl)
HRESULT MyGetSpecialFolderLocation(
    HWND hwnd, int csidl, PIDLIST_ABSOLUTE *ppidl)
{
 HRESULT hr;
 if (ISCUSTOMCSIDL(csidl)) {
  *ppidl = (PIDLIST_ABSOLUTE)CoTaskMemAlloc(sizeof(WORD));
  if (*ppidl) {
   ppidl-&gt;mkid.cb = 0;
   hr = S_OK;
  } else {
   hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
  }
 } else {
  hr = SHGetSpecialFolderLocation(hwnd, STANDARDCSIDLOF(csidl), ppidl);
 }
 return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, cool, now I can add
</p>
<pre>
 const static int csidls[] = {
  CSIDL_MYDOCUMENTS,
  CSIDL_MYMUSIC,
  CSIDL_COMMON_DOCUMENTS,
  <font color="blue">CUSTOMCSIDL_DESKTOP,</font>
 };
</pre>
<p>
Oh wait, I also have to have a custom version of
<code>SHBind­To­Object</code> that knows how to bind to
this special new type of pidl that means “where you are now.”
</p>
<pre>
HRESULT MyBindToObject(IShellFolder *psf, PCUIDLIST_RELATIVE pidl,
  IBindCtx *pbc, REFIID riid, void **ppv)
{
 HRESULT hr;
 if (pidl-&gt;mkid.cb == 0) {
  *ppv = NULL;
  if (psf == NULL) {
   hr = SHGetDesktopFolder(&amp;psf);
   if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
    hr = psf-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
    psf-&gt;Release();
   }
  } else {
   hr = psf-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);
  }
 } else {
  hr = SHBindToObject(psf, pidl, pbc, riid, ppv);
 }
 return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
Congratulations, you just reinvented <code>CSIDL_DESKTOP</code>.
</p>
<p>
It can be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern">
very convenient to have a name for the null action</a>.</p>
