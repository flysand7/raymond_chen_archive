<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Did I know where the Novell short file name behavior came from?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Commenter Yuhong Bao asks, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1624464">Do you know that the Novell behavior described in “Not all short filenames contain a tilde” came from HPFS?</a>” </p>
<p> Yes, but it was not relevant to the discussion so I didn’t bother mentioning it. Going into more detail on the history of the Novell “long namespace” would just encourage people to conclude, “This problem affects only Novell, and since I don’t use Novell, I don’t have to worry about this.” </p>
