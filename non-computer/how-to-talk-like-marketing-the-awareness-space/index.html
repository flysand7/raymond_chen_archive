<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to talk like Marketing: The awareness space</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The great thing about Marketing is that you get to use words and phrases that normal human beings never use. Here’s an example from over a decade ago:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> XYZ fit the installed base of web browsers we were targeting, and worked well in an awareness space. </p></blockquote>
<p> I have no idea what an “awareness space” is.</p>
<p> The punch line? This sentence came from a person whose title was “Director of Communication”! </p>
