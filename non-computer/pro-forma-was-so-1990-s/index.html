<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">“Pro forma” was so 1990’s</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>“Non-GAAP” is the new “pro forma”.</p>
<p> Remember the exciting dot-com boom days? Everybody was reporting “pro forma” results. <i><a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2068291/">Pro forma</a></i> in the 1990’s turned into a euphemism for “We just made this stuff up”. But after the dot-com bust and a series of accounting scandals, the phrase <i>pro forma</i> turned into a bad word on Wall Street. People swore off that <i>pro forma</i> nonsense and returned to the good old GAAP numbers. </p>
<p> But we all knew that that wouldn’t last for long. </p>
<p> But people aren’t being so cheeky as to use the phrase <i>pro forma</i>. No, the magic phrase is now “non-GAAP”. Punch that into your favorite search engine and watch all the people reporting earnings that do not conform to generally accepted accounting practices. </p>
<p> Let’s see how long before this ruse finally collapses. And how much money people lose as a result. </p>
