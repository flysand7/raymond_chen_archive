<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why Johnny can't read music</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679894268"> <i>He Bear, She Bear</i></a>, the musical instrument identified as a tuba is clearly a sousaphone. </p>
<p> (For those who are wondering what the title has to do with the topic of musical instrument identification: It’s a reference to the classic book <i>Why Johnny Can’t Read</i>.) </p>
