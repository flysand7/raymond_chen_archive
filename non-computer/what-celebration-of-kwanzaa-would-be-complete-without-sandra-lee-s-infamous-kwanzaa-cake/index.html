<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What celebration of Kwanzaa would be complete without Sandra Lee's infamous Kwanzaa cake?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> For those unfamiliar with Sandra Lee, her gimmick is that the ingredients in her recipes are primarily prepared foods, a food-preparation technique (I’m reluctant to call it cooking) which she calls “semi-homemade.” </p>
<p> First, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/kwanzaa-cake/1455.html"> the creation</a> one critic called “an edible hate crime.” </p>
<p> Next, <a href="http://www.eurweb.com/2010/12/woman-behind-sandra-lee%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98kwanzaa-cake%E2%80%99-explains-debacle/"> the apology from the creator</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I guess I imagined something more refined. And I know the Corn Nuts were disgusting, but she didn’t. As a matter of fact, the more tasteless the recipes got the more she liked them, the faster she approved them. </p></blockquote>
