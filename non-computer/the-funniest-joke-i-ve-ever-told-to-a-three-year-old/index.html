<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The funniest joke I've ever told (to a three-year-old)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve tested this joke on several children ages three and four, and it never fails.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> There were two kittens walking down the street, and one of them fell on its butt! </p></blockquote>
<p> I developed this joke for one of my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/27/9570320.aspx"> honorary nieces</a>. She had just started to learn about joke-telling and asked me to tell her a joke. One of the keys to joke-telling is to know your audience: A three-year-old won’t have the attention span for a longer joke, and subtlety and observational humor won’t work either. It’s got to be short and direct. She thought kittens were cute, and falling on one’s butt was funny, so I figured, hey, let me combine the two.</p>
<p> When I told this joke, she fell on the floor in uncontrollable laughter. I had a winner. </p>
