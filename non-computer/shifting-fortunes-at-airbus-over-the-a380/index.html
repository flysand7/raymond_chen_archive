<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Shifting fortunes at Airbus over the A380</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The Airbus A380 will be the largest-capacity commercial passenger plane, once they get around to making them. <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/business/4236525.html"> Now two years behind schedule</a>, the A380 is not making life any easier for their parent company EADS. And in this two-player world, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/10/05/PM200610054.html"> bad news for Airbus means good news for Boeing</a>. </p>
<p> As a Seattleite, I naturally root for Boeing over Airbus. After all, Boeing started here (even if they did <a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2001/q2/news_release_010510a.html"> move to Chicago a few years ago</a>), and many people forget that they are easily the largest single technology company in the Seattle area, with twice as many local employees as Microsoft. </p>
