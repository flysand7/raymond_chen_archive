<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The social skills of a thermonuclear device: Why did you hang up?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One morning I’m working in my office and I’m interrupted by a telephone call. The caller-ID shows that it came in through the switchboard. (I.e., somebody called the main Microsoft number and asked for me by name.)</p>
<p> <b>Me</b>: Hello? </p>
<p> <b>Caller</b>: [angrily] Mr. Chen, why did you hang up? </p>
<p> I don’t recognize the voice, and I haven’t received a phone call in several days, so I have no idea who this person is or what he’s talking about. But if somebody starts out rude to me, that doesn’t put me in the friendliest of moods. Still, I use a polite tone of voice. </p>
<p> <b>Me</b>: Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll do it again. [click] </p>
<p> A few minutes later, my phone rang again. The caller-ID shows that it is once again a call from the switchboard. I let it go to voice mail. </p>
<p> Shortly thereafter, I received a notification that I have a new voicemail message. Here’s a transcript: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> [swearing in a language I don’t recognize] Why do you keep hanging up on me? I asked you, are you Raymond Chen, and then I talk to you, and you hang up. Are you stupid or something? [click] </p></blockquote>
<p> Now I kind of feel bad that the caller probably got the wrong person. There are at least four people at Microsoft who share my name (or a name very similar to it). </p>
