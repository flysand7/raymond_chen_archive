<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It's official: The logo for the London 2012 Olympic Games is hideously ugly</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Yesterday, the organizers of the London 2012 Olympic Games unveiled <a href="http://www.london2012.com/"> their official logo</a>, and it’s officially hideous. They paid £400,000 for <i>that</i>? As one of my friends put it, it looks like a bunch of old people tried to imagine something that would appeal to young people. Unfortunately, they forgot that today’s young people don’t live in the 1980’s.</p>
