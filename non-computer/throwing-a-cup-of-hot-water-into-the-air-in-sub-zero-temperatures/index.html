<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Throwing a cup of hot water into the air in sub-zero temperatures</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One of my colleagues on a previous team was stationed in Alaska as part of his military service. He said that one of the things people did for a cheap thrill was to take a cup of hot water outside when it was like a bazillion degrees below zero and throw it up into the air. (Things must be really boring in Alaska in the dead of winter.) </p>
