<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How air conditioning revolutionized competitive bicycling</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I’m not really interested in sports. Teams, standings, scores, who got traded to what team, none of that is interesting to me. What I am interested in, however, is “meta-sports”: The business of sports, the technology of sports, the evolution of techniques, changes in the rules, that sort of thing. That’s one of the reasons I’m a fan of the radio program <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/">Only a Game</a>. (The other, more important, reason can be summed up in two words: <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/about/staff/charliepierce.asp"> Charlie Pierce</a>.) </p>
<p> All that is a rather lengthy lead-in to <a href="http://www.corante.com/transition/"> Transition Game</a>, Nick Schulz’s look at the world behind sports. He covers what it is about sports that I like, with none of the stuff I don’t like. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/31/404109.aspx">I’ve linked to him before</a>, but I like him so much I’m going to do it again.) You too can learn <a href="http://www.corante.com/transition/archives/2005/07/20/the_key_to_cycling_greatness_air_conditioning.php"> how air conditioning revolutionized competitive bicycling</a>. Or you can learn about <a href="http://www.corante.com/transition/archives/2005/10/03/and_theyre_off.php"> the use of robots as camel jockeys in Qatar</a>. <a href="http://www.cob.tamucc.edu/waheed/Teaching%20Aids/Robot%20as%20camel%20jockey%20in%20Qatar%2019%20Apr%202005%20Yahoo.jpg"> Here’s a picture</a>. It’s like an episode of Futurama come to life. </p>
