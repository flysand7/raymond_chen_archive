<p>         The nice thing about the schwa sound is that you don’t have to spell it.      </p>
<p>         Many thanks to C-J Berg for fixing my Swedish spelling errors. I probably introduced         some new ones here, though.      </p>
<p>         But why Swedish?      </p>
<p>         Well, it wasn’t Swedish initially. Many years ago, I saw an ad in the local newspaper         that read, “Free Norwegian lessons, Tuesday nights at Xyz Church, Ballard.” (<a href="http://www.nwsource.com/travel/scr/tf_detail.cfm?id=4157&amp;cid=0&amp;pageid=WA&amp;cityid=2">Ballard</a> is         the Scandinavian neighborhood in Seattle.) I read it and though Norwegian lessons         would be a fun, borderline goofy, thing to do. Especially since I figured most of         the other people in the class were there because their parents forced them. When the         Olympics were held a few years later in Lillehammer I was again inspired to learn         Norwegian, because the sound of the language appealed to me.      </p>
<p>         But it never really got past the “Gosh that would be fun” phase, until this year.      </p>
<p>         A friend of mine moved to Sweden, so I figured, “Well, if I’m going to learn a Scandinavian         language, Swedish seems the better choice now. And besides, it means I get to talk         to the people who work at IKEA in their native language!” (Nevermind that the people         who work at the Seattle IKEA probably don’t speak Swedish anyway.)      </p>
<p>     The hard part is trying to prevent Swedes from switching to English when they hear     that your Swedish isn’t native-fluent.  </p>
