<p>Some time ago, I was visiting a family with small children, and I found the two-year-old middle child with a marker in her hand suspiciously close to some fresh marks on the living room couch. The following conversation ensued:</p>
<p> “Who drew on the couch?” </p>
<p> — <i>My older sister.</i> </p>
<p> “Your older sister isn’t home.” </p>
<p> — <i>The baby.</i> </p>
<p> “The baby can’t reach this.” </p>
<p> — <i>The dog.</i> </p>
<p> “You don’t have a dog.” </p>
