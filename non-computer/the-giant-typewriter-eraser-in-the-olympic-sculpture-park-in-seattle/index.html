<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The giant typewriter eraser in the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/OSP/"> Olympic Sculpture Park</a> in Seattle is open and free to the public all year around. (And I’m surprised they haven’t <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=657daec0-134e-4edf-90c3-ac57565c478b"> gotten the heat from the IOC</a> over use of the word <i>Olympic</i>.)
 One of the works is a <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/photos/photo.asp?PhotoID=112017"> giant typewriter eraser</a>. When my friend took her niece (I’m guessing around ten years old at the time) to visit the park, the girl asked, “What’s that?”
 — <i>Oh, that’s a typewriter eraser. Back before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DVXNYK/?tag=tholneth-20"> Wite-Out</a> or eraser ribbons, this was how you corrected mistakes. This end is the eraser, and you use that end to brush the crumbs off.</i>
 The next question was unexpected, but in retrospect, inevitable.</p>
