<p>There’s a new <i>Star Trek</i> series starting up. Here’s my proposal for an episode: </p>
<p>The crew discover a long-dead planet. The away team manages to figure out how the the extinct civilization’s computer systems work. They power it on and find it’s filled with cat videos and the occasional bottle flipping video. </p>
<p>The end. </p>
