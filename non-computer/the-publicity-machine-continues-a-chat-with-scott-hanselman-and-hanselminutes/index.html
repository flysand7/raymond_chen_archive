<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The publicity machine continues: A chat with Scott Hanselman and Hanselminutes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/"> Scott Hanselman</a> let me know he was going to be in town, and after some negotiation with the company PR department (who probably get the massive heebie-jeebies from this whole blog thing), I was able to accept his invitation to appear on his weekly podcast, <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/"> HanselMinutes</a>. <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast56TheOldNewThingWithRaymondChen.aspx"> We sat down for a little chat</a>, and a few weeks later, <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=73"> I became Show #56</a>.
 I haven’t had the nerve to listen to it myself. I hope I came off okay.</p>
<p> In other self-promotion news (did I mention yet that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> I wrote a book</a>?), it looks like I will be in Palo Alto on April 21 for a family event, and I’ll likely spend the 20th visiting Microsoft’s Silicon Valley Campus. If you’d like me to pay a visit to your user group or whatever, let me know. </p>
