<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Let there be a grand clubhouse feast!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Kenny Mayne is one of the regular anchors for  ESPN SportsCenter  and for some reason I find this particular home run call hilarious:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  I am king of the diamond!  <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/multimedia/king.wav">  Let there be a grand clubhouse feast</a>! [WAV]  Bring me the finest meats and cheeses throughout the land!  <br/>  — From <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/multimedia/">The  SportsCenter Altar multimedia download center</a>.  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Here’s  <a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/waitwait/20020511.waitwait.04.ram">  a whimisical interview where he explains where he got that from</a>  [RealAudio].
  Another one I like for its understatedness:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/phrases/usage.asp?ID=408">  &lt;Football player&gt; has decided to tackle people on behalf of  the &lt;NFL team&gt;</a>.  Terms of the contract are not disclosed,  but we believe it has something to do with money.  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Actually, I enjoyed just reading through  <a href="http://www.sportscenteraltar.com/phrases/phrases.asp">  a collection of phrases used by the SportsCenter anchors</a>.</p>
<p>  Almost makes me want to watch television.  </p>
