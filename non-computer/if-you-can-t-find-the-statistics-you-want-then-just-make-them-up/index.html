<p>Yesterday, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124026415808636575.html"> America’s Newest Profession: Bloggers for Hire</a> and included this handy little chart:</p>

<p> I found this number hard to believe, so I followed the <i>Source</i> link to the information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I found that, yup, in a May 2007 survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that there were indeed 555,770 lawyers, 394,710 computer programmers, 299,160 chief executives, and 289,710 fire fighters in the United States. </p>
<p> Bloggers? Didn’t even make the list. The number 452,000 appears nowhere in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report. </p>
<p> If you can’t find the statistics you want, then just make them up (but claim somebody else provided them). </p>
<p> (The comments on the article suggest that the number 452,000 was derived from a Technorati report that there were 20 million blogs, of which only 4.7 million have been active in the past four months. The number 20 million was then combined with a Technorati survey of active bloggers in which 2% of them self-reported blogging as their primary source of income.) </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: “Microsoft’s current advertising campaign uses made-up numbers.” </p>
<p> <b>Bonus statistics</b>: The claim that “It takes about <a href="http://technorati.com/blogging/state-of-the-blogosphere/blogging-for-profit/"> 100,000 unique visitors</a> a month to generate an income of $75,000 a year” is a total misrepresentation of the Technorati report. Technorati said that the average annual income among people with 100,000 <u>or more</u> unique monthly visitors is $75,000. That’s like seeing that the average salary for a professional baseball player is <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2008a.shtml"> $3.1 million</a> and concluding that once you reach the big leagues, you’ll be pulling down $3.1 million, when in fact—as the new guy—you’ll most likely be making the baseball minimum wage of $390,000. </p>
