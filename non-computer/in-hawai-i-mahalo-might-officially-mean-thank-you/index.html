<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">In Hawaiʻi, "mahalo" might officially mean "thank you"</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In Hawaiʻi, you see the word <i>Mahalo</i> on signs everywhere. In theory, the word means <i>Thank you</i>, but my friend <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net"> Joe Beda</a> pointed out that in practice the word has a completely different meaning. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not accept coupons at this location. Mahalo. </li>
<li>No refills. Mahalo. </li>
<li>This counter is closed. Mahalo. </li>
<li>Elevator is out of order. Please use stairs. Mahalo. </li>
<li>Rest rooms for customers only. Mahalo. </li>
</ul>
<p> In practice, the word <i>mahalo</i> means <i>You’re screwed</i>.</p>
<p> <b>Obligatory clarification</b>: This was a joke, an attempt at observational humor. </p>
