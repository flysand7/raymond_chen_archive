<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Food products that are offenses against nature: Bisquick Shake 'n Pour</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Yes, it’s another entry in the extremely sporadic series of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/19/3945340.aspx"> food products that are offenses against nature</a>. Today it’s the incorrectly-punctuated <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jovino/2232822609/"> Bisquick Shake ‘n Pour</a>.
 For people for whom adding a half cup of milk and one egg to two cups of <a href="http://www.generalmills.com/corporate/brands/product_image.aspx?catID=51&amp;itemID=1808"> Bisquick powder</a> is too complicated, now they’ve even dehydrated the milk and egg and pre-measured the mix, so all you need to do is add a measured amount of water. Because you know, cracking an egg is so time-consuming.</p>
<p> My colleague who tips me off to all the foods that are offenses against nature let me know by email that even she, mother to a three-week-old baby, was able to somehow pull it together and measure out the milk and crack the egg. “Oh wait,” she corrected herself. “I made the pancakes from scratch.” </p>
