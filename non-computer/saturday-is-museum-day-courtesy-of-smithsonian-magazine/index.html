<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Saturday is Museum Day, courtesy of Smithsonian Magazine</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>September 30, 2006 is the first  <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/">  Museum Day</a> open to the general public.  (Apparently, previous Museum Days were limited to subscribers of  Smithsonian Magazine.)
  You will have to print out the  <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/files/md_card.html">  Museum Day Admissions Coupon</a>  to get in.  Some restrictions apply.  Read the fine print.</p>
<p>  Even the  <a href="http://www.icr.org/event/221/">Institute for Creation  Research</a> (an actual museum!) is getting into the act.  </p>
