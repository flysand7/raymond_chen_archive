<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Your chance to meet Raymond if you are near Palo Alto on the 23rd</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s been a slight change in plans. I will be in Palo Alto on April 23rd <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/26/1949083.aspx"> rather than April 20th</a>. Not that anybody is affected by this beyond the folks at Microsoft’s Silicon Valley Campus, since nobody else took me up on my offer. I guess I’m not as popular as I thought.
 <b>Update 13-Apr-2007</b>: Here’s my schedule for April 23rd when I’m down San Jose way.</p>

<p> Now the term “presentation” is a bit of an overstatement. It’s really just me telling a bunch of stories, but instead of sitting at a table with a bunch of people, I’ll be standing in front of a room. Same stories, different audio system. I’ll have a number of stories prepared, but I’m hoping some of the chatter will inspire other stories. (I won’t do a coding presentation because, I mean really, a presentation on Win32 programming topics is bo-ring.)</p>
<p> Extremely limited guest seating—we’re talking one or two people—may be available at the Apple chat. The other appearances are closed-door. Dinner plans have yet to be settled, but I suspect that’s your better bet. Contact me directly for details (if you haven’t already). </p>
