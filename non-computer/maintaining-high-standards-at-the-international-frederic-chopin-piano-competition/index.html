<p> The quintennial <a href="http://www.konkurs.chopin.pl/index_en.html"> International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition</a> will be held later this year, and I was reminded that the awards for “Best performance of a mazurka” and “Best performance of a concerto” have not been awarded <a href="http://www.chopin.pl/imprezy/konkursy/c11.html"> since 1985</a>. Simply put: Nobody since 1985 has been good enough to deserve it. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.chopin.pl/imprezy/konkursy/c13.html"> The year 1995 was a particularly bad year for Chopin-lovers</a>. The judges for Competition XIII concluded that none of the 130 entrants deserved <strong>any</strong> of the four big-name prizes. </p>
<ul>
<li>First prize – not awarded. </li>
<li>Best perfomance of the mazurkas – not awarded. </li>
<li>Best performance of a polonaise – not awarded. </li>
<li>Best performance of a concerto – not awarded. </li>
</ul>
<p> (This wasn’t the first time the judges refused to award first prize. It happened <a href="http://www.chopin.pl/imprezy/konkursy/c12.html"> five years earlier</a> as well.) </p>
