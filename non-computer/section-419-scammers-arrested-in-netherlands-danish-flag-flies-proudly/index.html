<blockquote class="q"><p><a href="http://www.katv.com/news/stories/0104/122644.html">Dutch police have arrested 52 people suspected of defrauding gullible Internet users</a> in one of the largest busts of the infamous “Nigerian e-mail” scam. Hooray for the Dutch police. Their next target: Web sites that illustrate a Dutch article with the Danish flag.</p>
