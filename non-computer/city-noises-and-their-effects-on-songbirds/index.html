<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">City noises and their effects on songbirds</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Robins in Sheffield <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/apr/25/conservation.uknews"> sing at night because it’s too noisy in the daytime</a>. That reminds me that when I was in Antigua, Guatemala, I was told that the songbirds in the city have started mimicking car alarms. Apparently this is also happening in Oregon <a href="http://www.oregoncommentator.com/2004/04/29/shakra-was-a-rolling-stone/#comment-2356"> with birds mimicking car alarms and cell phone ring tones</a>.</p>
