<p> <a href="http://www.fawltysite.net/episode06.htm"><i>The Germans</i></a> is probably the most well-known episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/f/fawltytowers_7772600.shtml"> <i>Fawlty Towers</i></a>. Who better than John Cleese, therefore, to release the song <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5409116"> <i>Don’t Mention the War</i></a>, just in time for the World Cup. The purpose is to mend fences between Britain and Germany, but it might just make things worse, who knows.</p>
