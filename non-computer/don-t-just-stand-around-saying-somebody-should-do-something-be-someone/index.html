<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don't just stand around saying somebody should do something: Be someone</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On one of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/07/10101193.aspx"> frivolous mailing lists</a> in the Windows project, somebody spotted some behavior that seemed pretty bad and filed a bug on it. The project was winding down, with fewer and fewer bugs being accepted by the release management team each day, so it was not entirely surprising that this particular bug was also rejected. News of this smackdown threw the mailing list into an fit of apoplexy.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Don’t they realize how bad this bug is? Somebody should reactivate this bug. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Yeah, this is really serious. I don’t think they understood the scope of the problem. Somebody should mark the bug for reconsideration. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Definitely. Someone should reactivate the bug and reassert the issue. </p></blockquote>
<p> After about a half dozen of messages like this, I couldn’t take it any longer.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  I can’t believe I’m reading this. </p>
<p> I decided to Be Someone. I reactivated the bug and included a justification. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Don’t just stand around saying somebody should do something. Be that someone.</p>
<p> (And even though it’s not relevant to the story, the bug was ultimately accepted by the release management team the second time around because all the discussion of the bug gave the bug <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/05/9043631.aspx"> representative</a> more information with which to to argue why the bug should be fixed.) </p>
