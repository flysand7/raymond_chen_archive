<p>A friend of mine who had been married less than a year received a phone call from Adam, one of his still-single friends:
 “Hey, Joe! Irving and I are going into town, hit some bars, hang out at some clubs, wanna come along?”
 My friend replied, “Hang on a second.”
 A beat.
 “Nope. Still married!”</p>
<p> As far as I know, Adam and Irving are still single. </p>
