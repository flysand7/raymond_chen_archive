<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3682329.stm">  Plane-spotters to require government license</a>.  The article spins it as a “benefit” for ground-based aviation buffs,  but this is just one of those “two steps back, one step forwards”  things.  Plane-spotters were outright banned from airports in the  summer of 2003.
  Now they can go back, but they’ll need to shell out £15  for the privilege.
  And if I, random small-time aviation buff, want to go out and look at the  pretty planes as they fly overhead, I’m out of luck.  The “authorized” plane admirers might even report me as a security risk.</p>
<p>  I hope I won’t be  <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,56214,00.html">  convicted of international espionage</a>.  </p>
