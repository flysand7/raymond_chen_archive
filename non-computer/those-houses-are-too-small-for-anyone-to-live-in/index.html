<p> <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/"> Not Always Right</a> is a collection of brief stories told by people in customer service. One of my favorites is from somebody who lives on Catalina Island and had to answer the question, “<a href="http://notalwaysright.com/must-be-from-orange-county/580">What time does the island close?</a>” </p>
<p> Runners-up: (I’ve left off the punch lines so as not to spoil the surprise.) </p>
<ul>
<li>     The person who     called 9-1-1     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/your-urgency-is-not-my-emergency/626">     because</a>… </li>
<li>     The person who didn’t read the sign     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/translation-stupid/3022">     because</a>… </li>
<li>     The person who didn’t read the sign     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/a-sign-of-a-long-day/3201">     because</a>… </li>
<li>     The person who couldn’t get out of the building     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/why-judgment-days-gonna-be-a-cakewalk-part-2/3270">     because</a>… </li>
<li>     The person who can’t get into the bathroom     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/cant-take-a-hint-or-a-leak/2541">     because</a>… </li>
<li>     The person who can’t enter the password     <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/now-i-dont-know-my-abcs/2766">     because</a>… </li>
</ul>
<p> The stories have been collected into a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0740785788?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>The Customer Is Not Always Right: Hilarious and Horrific Tales of Customers Gone Wrong</i></a>. It’s almost certainly a funnier and more enjoyable read than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321440307?tag=tholneth-20"> my own book</a>. What’s more, they have <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6298174767"> a Facebook group</a> and I don’t. Maybe I should start one? </p>
