<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Luxurifying the camping experience in a different direction</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Some time ago, I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/27/9376606.aspx"> noted the increasing luxurification of camping</a>, where people with more money than sense decide to go through the camping experience without building any of the character that comes with it. </p>
<p> But that’s not the only direction luxurification has moved. Unwilling to accept that “getting there is half the fun”, some people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/nyregion/to-reach-simple-life-at-camp-lining-up-for-private-jets.html?_r=1"> take chartered planes to and from summer camp</a>. Stick it out for the punch line in the final sentence of the article. </p>
