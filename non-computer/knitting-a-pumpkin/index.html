<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Knitting a pumpkin</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>     I’ve decided to change the color scheme to match my latest knitting project:      A pumpkin hat. (Previous food-themed hats were raspberry and eggplant.)     I just got a call from the yarn store that the yarn for my sweater has come in, and     I can’t wait.</p>
