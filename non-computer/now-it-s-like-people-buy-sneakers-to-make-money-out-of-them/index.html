<p> Such trading bothers purists like Raymond Chen, 26. </p>
<p> “People used to buy sneakers because they love them,” Chen said. “<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003860682_sneakerhead020.html">Now it’s like people buy sneakers to make money out of them.</a>” </p>
<p> Chen, an engineer from Shoreline, owns about 120 pairs of sneakers and spends about $100 a month on his hobby. If there are a number of shoes releasing within the same month, he spends more. </p>
