<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Dead Grandmother/Exam Syndrome</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I draw your attention to this research paper from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100527184417/http://www.easternct.edu/~adams/"> Professor Mike Adams from Eastern Connecticut State University</a> titled <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100528001006/https://www.easternct.edu/~adams/Resources/Grannies.pdf"> <i>The Dead Grandmother/Exam Syndrome</i></a>, also published in <a href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume5/v5i6/v5i6-toc.html"> <i>The Annals of Improbable Research</i></a>. In the paper, Adams investigates the phenomenon he summarizes as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>A student’s grandmother is far more likely to die suddenly just before the student takes an exam than at any other time of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>He takes twenty years of historical data and confirms the existence of the phenomenon, thereby drawing attention to an important but overlooked national health problem: Increased mortality of women with grandchildren in college during the weeks leading up to exams.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is no exam imminent, the death rate is independent of how well the student is doing in class.</li>
<li>As a midterm nears, the death rate goes up by a factor of ten. As a final looms, it goes up by a factor of 19.</li>
<li>The effect is strongly dependent on how well the student is doing in class. Grandmothers of students doing poorly are at much greater risk. A grandmother of a failing student is 50 times more likely to die in the week prior to a final than a grandmother of a top student when there is no examination imminent.</li>
<li>Grandmothers are 24 times more likely to die than grandfathers.</li>
<li>The effect is independent of family size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adams develops theories which attempt to explain these phenomena and also has some proposals for addressing the effect.</p>
<p>A follow-up study by Professor Lee Jussim of Rutgers University examined ways of addressing this enormous danger posed to grandmothers. In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110609015741/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/grandma.html"> <i>A Preliminary Report on an Intervention Designed to Reduce Grandmother Death Resulting From College Exams</i></a>, Jussim found a way to save the lives of 4 out of 5 grandmothers during the lead-up to exams: Inform students that the make-up exam will be brutally difficult.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The articles are written tongue-in-cheek, but other less whimsical explanations for the observed behavior include</p>
<ul>
<li>If a grandmother passes when no exam is imminent, the student will miss class without explanation.</li>
<li>Good students are less likely to ask for assistance with exams even if they lose a grandmother.</li>
<li>A student with an ill grandmother is more likely to have poor grades due to stress/worry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that the predicted grandmother popular collapse did not come to pass. One theory is that this was prevented due to another phenomenon: Grade inflation.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: In <i>A Thorny Problem: Student Deceptions</i>, Professor Karen Eifler shares her simple solution for this problem: <a href="https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/dealing-with-student-deceptions-what-to-do-with-death-in-the-family-excuses/"> She sends a condolence card to the family</a>. If the student experienced a genuine loss, the letter is received warmly. On the other hand, a student who is being less than completely honest has some awkward explaining to do when their family asks them what this card is about. Within a year, the false claims of family deaths evaporated.</p>
