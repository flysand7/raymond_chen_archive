<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wheels of government bureaucracy turn slowly: Green cards</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When foreign nationals come to work at Microsoft, the legal department gets to work with the paperwork of applying for permanent residency (colloquially known as a <i>green card</i> even though the cards haven’t been green for a long time). Obtaining permanent resident status in the United States takes a ridiculous amount of time, and I remember the irony when one of my colleagues finally received his green card… on his last day working at Microsoft. </p>
<p> Still, at least it arrived in time, if only barely. <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> :: Wendy ::</a> received her green card <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2008/01/22/us-resident-not/"> two months after she left the country</a>. </p>
