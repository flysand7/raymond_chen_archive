<p>         Here are some things I learned in Sweden, Germany and Denmark.      </p>
<ul>
<li>             If you are an airplane pilot, you should avoid communicating on the emergency frequency             unless you have an actual emergency.          </li>
<li>             In Sweden, marmalade comes in a flexible tube that looks like a really fat sausage.          </li>
<li>             Swedes can’t handle spicy-hot food.          </li>
<li>             Road warning signs are blue-and-yellow in Sweden, but red-and-white in Denmark.          </li>
<li>             You can drive really, really fast on the Autobahn.          </li>
<li>             Never drive in the left lane of the Autobahn unless you are actively passing somebody.          </li>
<li>             When you ask at the cafeteria, “Gibt’s Fleisch dabei?”, and the guy says, “Nein, s’gibt             kein Schweinfleisch”, don’t assume that he understood your question.         </li>
<li>             If somebody at Oktoberfest challenges you to drink your one-liter Maßbier in twenty             seconds, you should decline.          </li>
<li>             If you vomit at Oktoberfest, they charge €25 to clean it up.          </li>
<li>             You really don’t need to know that much information about lignite mining.          </li>
<li>             Parking in Copenhagen is free on Sunday. Putting money into the machine is a             waste.          </li>
</ul>
