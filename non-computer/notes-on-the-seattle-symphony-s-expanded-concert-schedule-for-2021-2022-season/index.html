<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Notes on the Seattle Symphony’s expanded concert schedule for 2021–2022 season</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In June, the Seattle Symphony announced that it was expanding its 2021–2022 season to include a full slate of concerts. The original March announcement had a reduced schedule due to uncertainty over the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. I have retroactively updated my <a href="/non-computer/the-2021-2022-seattle-symphony-subscription-season-at-a-glance"> Seattle Symphony 2021–2022 season rundown</a> to incorporate the new information.</p>
<p>The pandemic resulted in the cancellation of the normal 2020–2021 season. Instead, the Symphony held replacement concerts with no audience in the hall and programs compatible with physically-distance performers. These replacement concerts were streamed live to all subscribers regardless of ticket package, as well as to all members at the Friends level or higher.</p>
<p>Building upon the experience of producing live-streamed concerts, the Seattle Symphony is continuing the live streaming option for the 2021–2022 season with a new series called <i>Watch and Listen</i>. This includes 13 regular-season Masterworks concerts, plus seven additional concerts from other series or special events.¹ The Watch and Listen series is complimentary for members at the Friends level or higher. Technically, you can buy the series without a membership, but it costs the same as a membership, so <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20191129-01/?p=103164"> you may as well get the membership</a>.²</p>
<p>The Watch and Listen series overlaps with the Baroque &amp; Wine series and the Pops series, so those two get added to the table.</p>
<p>A new series <i>Octave 9</i> explores the fusion of music and technology in the new <a href="https://www.seattlesymphony.org/octave-9/">Raisbeck Music Center</a>. This series was originally scheduled to premiere in the now-cancelled 2020–2021 season.</p>
<p>Khatia Buniatishvili was the scheduled artist in residence for the cancelled 2020–2021 season, so we never got to see her. This year, Yuja Wang performs in recital. (Still <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210630-00/?p=105383"> waiting for Alice Sara Ott</a>.)</p>
<p>¹ If they continue the policy from the 2020–2021 season, the live-streamed concerts will be available for on-demand viewing for one week following the concert.</p>
<p>² You might want to buy it à la carte if you want to see only a few of the concerts. In that case, you can get a monthly pass for the month you care about, rather than an annual pass for the entire season. But really, just support your local artistic organizations if you can afford it.</p>
