<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Gävle Goat is now 50 years old</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In 1966, the Swedish town of Gävle started the tradition of erecting a giant goat made of straw for the Christmas holiday season, and it continues to be the leading example of same. This sounds weird out of context, but a Christmas goat made of straw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Goat">is a long-standing Swedish tradition</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, the tradition began in 1966, so the goat is now 50 years old. (Note: Not actually the same goat. Because read on.) </p>
<p>As the goat himself <a href="http://merjuligavle.blogspot.com/">blogged</a>, “<a href="http://merjuligavle.blogspot.com/2016/11/torsdag-24-november-im-bock.html">I’m bock</a>.”¹ The Gävle Goat also <a href="https://twitter.com/gavlebocken">tweets</a>, in both Swedish and English, and it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gavlebocken/">an Instagram account</a>. </p>
<p>The Gävle Goat is famous for many things. It’s an annual tradition. It holds the Guiness world record for <a href="http://www.visitgavle.se/en/the-gavlegoat-0">the largest straw goat</a>. It has <a href="http://www.visitgavle.se/sv/gavlebocken">a round-the-clock webcam</a>. And most years, vandals burn it down. (Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat">a rundown of the goat’s fate in nearly every year of its existence</a>.) </p>

<p>¹ This is a multilingual pun (my favorite kind). The Gävle Goat goes by the Swedish name <i>Gävlebocken</i>. which means, um, “The Gävle Goat.” The Swedish word for goat is <i>bock</i>. </p>
