<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">High school students guess what happens to money deposited into checking accounts</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In August 2007, the results of the first nationwide high school economics graduation tests were released. (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/main2006/2007475.pdf">Download the report [pdf]</a>.) It appears that the results were better than expected, but let’s not celebrate too quickly: The results were that 42% of students rated “Proficient” and 3% “Advanced”. And only 52% of the students could answer this multiple-choice question correctly: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> What happens to most of the money deposited in checking accounts at a commercial bank? </p>
<ol type="A">
<li>It is used to pay the bank’s expenses. </li>
<li>It is loaned to other bank customers. </li>
<li>It is kept in the bank’s vault until depositors withdraw     the funds. </li>
<li>It is paid to owners of the bank     as return on their investment. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p> I guess 48% of the students have never seen <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i>. </p>
