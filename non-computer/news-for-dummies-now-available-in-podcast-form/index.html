<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">News for dummies now available in podcast form</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m probably the only person who uses the “News for dummies” links in the navigation pane on this page, and now I’m going to use them even less. The <a href="http://www.sr.se/p4/klartext/"> Swedish news for dummies</a> recently became available <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/klartext/artikel.asp?nyheter=1&amp;ProgramID=493&amp;Artikel=829830"> in podcast form</a> [<a href="http://www.sr.se/Podradio/xml/p4_klartext.xml">RSS</a>], joining the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,,2146,00.html"> German news for dummies</a>, which has been available <a href="http://www.dw-world.com/dw/article/0,2144,1833641,00.html"> as a podcast</a> [<a href="http://rss.dw-world.de/xml/podcast_langsam_gesprochene_nachrichten">RSS</a>] since the beginning of the year. (Both the Swedes and Germans have, of course, other <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/18/439940.aspx"> podcast</a> offerings beyond the news for dummies.)
 Of the two, I prefer the Swedish news for dummies. The German news for dummies is still your standard news report, but spoken m-i-n-d   b-o-g-g-l-i-n-g-l-y   s-l-o-w-l-y. Which means I can hear every syllable clearly without actually understanding anything, since they still use all that fancy German vocabulary. The Swedish news for dummies, on the other hand, proceeds at a methodical (as opposed to mind-numbing) pace and, more importantly, explains the news using simpler words, words which I am much more likely to know.</p>
<p> (What’s the lesson here? I dunno. If you want to speak Swedish with me, talk like those Klartext folks. if you want to speak German with me, do <strong>not</strong> talk like those folks over at Deutsche Welle’s Langsam gesprochene Nachrichten because I won’t understand you. But your best choice is probably English, since your English will be about twenty times better than my Swedish or German.) </p>
