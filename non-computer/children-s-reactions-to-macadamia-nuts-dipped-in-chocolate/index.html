<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Children's reactions to macadamia nuts dipped in chocolate</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, we had some people over our house for dinner, and we had a selection of desserts including chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. The children in attendance finished their dinner before the adults (because the adults were busy <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/10/9862759.aspx"> doing boring things like talking</a>) and were excused to go play.
 It so happens that the play room is right next to the kitchen, and in the kitchen was the dessert table, including a bowl of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, which the children managed to consume in their entirety before the adults <i>finally finished talking</i> and went to get dessert.
 The second half of the story didn’t come until a few days later, when we were taking out the recycling. At the bottom of the recycling bin was a collection of macadamia nuts with all the chocolate sucked off.</p>
