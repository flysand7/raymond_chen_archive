<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Great moments in journalism: “Confirmed Microsoft Surface Pro 5 launch date”</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today I wish to draw your attention to this article: <a href="http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Confirmed--Microsoft-Surface-Pro-5-to-be-launched-in-June-1462195453/"><i>Confirmed: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to be launched in June [2016]</i></a>. I added the “2016” because the article didn’t give a year in its headline, but it was posted in May 2016, so it was clearly referring to June 2016. </p>
<p>Even though the headline says “Confirmed”, if you actually read the article, you’ll find that it’s nearly all rumor and speculation. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>It seems that… </p>
<p>Reports say Microsoft has released these ads in order to indicate that the release of Surface Pro 5 is imminent. … </p>
<p>Rumours are swirling that the tablet will be unveiled in June along with Surface Book 2. … </p>
<p>Some reports claim that… </p>
<p>The Surface Pro 5 may… [I]t is expected that… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are only two statements in the entire article that are actually put forth as facts rather than speculation. </p>
<ol>
<li>“Recently, a patent for the Surface Pen was found on U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office website.” This is easily verified. </li>
<li>“The base model of Surface Pro 5 Core i5 will be priced at $899 while, [sic] the i7 processor model will cost $999.” This is stated as fact without any source. </li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, none of the allegedly-confirmed details actually came true in June 2016. So much for “confirmed”. </p>
