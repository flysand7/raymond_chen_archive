<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Buzzword-filled subject line easily misinterpreted by unsuspecting manager</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A colleague of mine submitted some paperwork regarding the end-date of his <a href="http://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/collegeinternships.aspx"> college intern</a>. The automated response combined HR buzzwords in an unfortunate way:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Subject</b>: Intern Termination Report was executed </p></blockquote>
<p> Just to be sure, my colleague stopped by his intern’s office. He’s still there. And still alive.</p>
<p> For now. </p>
