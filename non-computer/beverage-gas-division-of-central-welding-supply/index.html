<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Beverage Gas Division of Central Welding Supply</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The other day, I saw a van which was labeled <i>Beverage Gas Division of Central Welding Supply</i>.
 This odd juxtaposition was created by the acquisition of <a href="http://compressedgaswestern.com/"> Compressed Gas Western</a> by Central Welding Supply in 2009.</p>
<p> I sure hope they don’t get <a href="http://www.centralwelding.com/gas-products.htm"> their tanks</a> confused. </p>
