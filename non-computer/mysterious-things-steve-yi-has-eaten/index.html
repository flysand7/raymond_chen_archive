<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mysterious things Steve Yi has eaten</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I read with some fascination <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steveyi/"> Steven Yi</a>‘s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steveyi/archive/2006/01/28/518764.aspx"> <i>Mysterious Things I Have Eaten</i></a>, since I have had four out of five of them myself. And I love the little story he tells about sea cucumber.
 Kimchee, like <a href="http://netnet.net/~pineaire/Lutefisk.html"> lutefisk</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1469413"> surströmming</a>, most likely comes from the days before refrigeration. The acid produced by fermentation preserves (what’s left of) the food.</p>
<p> Oh, and if you’re keeping score: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dried squid: Too salty.     (Then again, I didn’t have the jerky type; mine was shredded.) </li>
<li>Sea cucumber: Awful. </li>
<li>Kudu poop: Haven’t tried it. </li>
<li>Kimchee: Not bad. </li>
<li>Shrimp chips: Awesome. </li>
</ul>
