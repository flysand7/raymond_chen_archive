<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nobody actually talks the way they do in training videos, do they?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m watching a training video and it starts off with patently unrealistic dialog.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I’m struggling with X. Maybe you can help me out with a different perspective, or some information that I’m not aware of. </p></blockquote>
<p> An opening line like that pretty much demands bad acting. You can tell that this dialogue was designed by a committee. Nobody actually talks like this.</p>
<p> Well, that’s perhaps too much of a blanket statement. Maybe people talk like this at the training company that produced the video. </p>
