<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Wayback machine: The Fake Job</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Digging through my pile of junk, I found a reference to <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/12/05/newyorker.apology.ap/"> a fake article in The New Yorker magazine titled <i>My Fake Job</i> that turned out to be (partly) fake itself</a>. Unfortunately, I missed the article the first time around so I didn’t get to see what all the excitement was about, but it sure sounded like a funny article. (Fractionally more details from the article <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/527981"> here</a>.) </p>
<p> I understand there are these buildings called “libraries” that keep hard copies of this stuff. Need to make a mental note to check one out someday. </p>
