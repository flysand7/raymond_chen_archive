<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">No farting please, we're Americans</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Apparently, when translating their Pokémon game from Japanese to English, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/garykac/archive/2006/08/26/725992.aspx"> Nintendo changed a question in an in-game personality test that asked you what you would do if you farted</a>. In the English-language version, you merely broke a rotten egg. What, do they think kids in the U.S. don’t fart? Or that they don’t enjoy fart jokes. Allow me to clear up any confusion: <i>Kids in the United States love fart jokes</i>.
 Or maybe British kids don’t fart. Perhaps that’s it.</p>
