<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Disaster averted, thanks to international time zones</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Boy, the world has been really lucky this year. After successfully <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/07/620778.aspx"> avoiding a massive tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean</a>, the world narrowly escaped global disaster as predicted by <a href="http://yisraylhawkins.com/"> Yisrayl Hawkins</a>, leader of the organization <a href="http://www.yahweh.com/"> The House of Yahweh</a>. What saved us? Well, I’ll <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1356092006"> let Mosheh Sang, leader of the organization in Kenya, explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> According to Sang, a nuclear war between the US and North Korea only failed to kick off Tuesday as expected due to difference in international time zones. </p></blockquote>
<p> But they’re not giving up yet. According to another leader, Eleazor Kamotho Mugwe:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It can take up to seven years from now for the said nuclear war to take place because the prophecy talks about September 12. </p></blockquote>
<p> To play it safe, they’re going to stay underground for a year. In a sense, then, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/23/world_will_end_on_9_.html"> BoingBoing reader Dave Kriesel got it right</a>. He predicted that the response would be, “Did I Say 9-12-2006? I meant to say 9-12-<i>2007</i>.”</p>
<p> Assuming the world hasn’t been destroyed by then, we’ll try to remember to check back on them next year, see how they’re doing. </p>
