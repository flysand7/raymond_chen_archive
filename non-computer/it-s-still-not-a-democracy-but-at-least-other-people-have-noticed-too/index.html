<p> I’m glad I’m not the only person to notice that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/27/121050.aspx"> elections for boards of directors are completely rigged so that the nominees always win and there’s nothing you can do about it</a>. It appears that the issue was <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/06/20/AM200606202.html"> the hot topic in this year’s proxy war skirmishes</a>. </p>
<p> This year, one company actually called me at home asking me to send in my proxy. I guess they didn’t have enough votes for the meeting to be held. I explained that not voting was an intentional decision on my part, since it was the only way I could prevent the board of directors from being elected. The caller appeared mollified by that explanation and didn’t press the issue further. </p>
