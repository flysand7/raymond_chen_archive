<p>The first rule of  <a href="http://labworks.hms.harvard.edu/thriller/">  Fruit Fly Fight Club</a>:  Flies can’t talk about Fruit Fly Fight Club.  Because they can’t talk at all.  At least not to humans.
  Researchers at Harvard Medical School took a break from  <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/bss/neuro/kravitz/moviepage.html">  studying lobster fighting</a> and shifted their focus to  fruit fly fights, and even  <a href="http://labworks.hms.harvard.edu/training_room/">  mutant fruit fly fights</a>.
  (Via  <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2004/06/fruit_fly_fight.html">  The Annals of Improbable Research</a>.)
  Fruit flies are strange creatures.  Or perhaps it’s that fruit fly researchers are strange creatures.
  One of my cousins was a fruit fly researcher.  She took fruit fly testicles and squashed them and then studied  them under a microscope, looking for… something… I forget.  I think just finding the fruit fly testicles in the first place  was accomplishment enough.
  Fruit fly researchers like to give their discoveries strange names.  Typically, a gene is named after what results when you disable it.  For example,  a gene without which fruit flies die in two days is named  <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/list.html?sect=1&amp;month=08&amp;year=2002&amp;min=3">Kenny</a>,  after the South Park character.
  My favorite: The gene without which fruit flies get  drunk really easily is called  <a href="http://tinman.vetmed.helsinki.fi/eng/drosophila.html">  cheap date</a>.  (That last page has several more funny gene names.)
  Yes, that’s right.  <a href="http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980514045427data_trunc_sys.shtml">  Fruit flies get drunk</a>.  There’s a fruit fly drunk-o-meter, though I forget how it works.  But one amusing aspect of fruit fly drunkenness is that just before  they finally pass out, there’s a big burst of activity.</p>
<p>  Strange gene naming has spread beyond the fruit fly world.  There is a human gene named  <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/jessell/sonic.html">  sonic hedgehog</a> after the Sega video game character.  (It’s related to the fruit fly gene “hedgehog”, so named because  disabling it causes the fly to develop into a ball with spikes.)  </p>
