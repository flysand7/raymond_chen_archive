<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The economics of soccer penalty kicks</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m fascinated by economics, specifically the application of economic theories to things you wouldn’t normally consider as economics. Back during the World Cup, Slate’s undercover economist column took a look at <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2144182"> the economics of penalty kicks</a>.
 Steven D. Levitt, co-author of another paper on the subject, <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/06/27/in-soccer-it-is-not-whether-you-win-or-lose-but-how-you-play-the-game/"> writes in more detail on the unusually low percentage of penalty kicks taken straight ahead</a>. I wasn’t aware of the “straight ahead” strategy, but the more I read about it (and watched a video of a successful execution) the more fascinated I was by this rarely-used strategy.</p>
<p> Levitt highlighted the “anti-straight-ahead bias” of the press, pointing out that the second Swiss shooter hit the crossbar and was not lambasted. But isn’t that worse than shooting straight ahead and being stopped? I mean, if you hit the crossbar, it means that the opposing goalie <i>didn’t even have to be there</i>. He could’ve been playing Nintendo or picking his nose. You’d think the cardinal rule of taking a penalty kick is <i>at least make it a shot on goal</i>. </p>
