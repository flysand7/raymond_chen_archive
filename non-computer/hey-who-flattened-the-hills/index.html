<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hey, who flattened the hills?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> This weekend, I went to a friend’s house on Mercer Island to see <a href="http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/"> the US Navy Blue Angels flight demonstration team</a> perform. <a href="http://www.seafair.com/airshow.asp"> They do this every summer</a> as part of Seattle’s <a href="http://www.seafair.com/"> Seafair</a> festival, but this was the first time I got to see the show up close and personal. The I-90 bridge is closed for safety reasons, and people are allowed to walk onto the highway (at least for a short distance) to get a better view of the demonstration. </p>
<p> Two summers ago my friend invited me to his place, but I made the mistake of trying to drive to Mercer Island—traffic was horrific and I finally arrived just as the show was wrapping up. (I did manage to glimpse a plane pass by at very low altitude though.) This year I decided to ride my bicycle to his house. It’s just an hour’s ride and I don’t have to worry about traffic! It seems that somebody flattened the hills along <a href="http://www.dreamflying.com/bicycle_commute/mercer_island.htm"> the bike path that follows highway I-90</a>. Okay maybe it’s just that I’m in better shape now but I like to think it’s because they were nice enough to flatten the hills. </p>
