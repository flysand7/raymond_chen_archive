<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Welcome to the maze and enjoy the Habitrail</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year, Microsoft Press and Microsoft Learning moved to new buildings in downtown Bellevue, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2009/01/30/moving-day.aspx"> bidding good-bye to <i>The Maze</i></a>. This was a nickname for their former building I had been unfamiliar with, but not having been to their building, I can’t say whether the name is deserved or not.
 What I do know, however, is that the small cluster of buildings they moved from are connected by enclosed walkways, which are nicknamed the <i>Habitrail</i> due to their startling similarity to the hamster transportation tubes. Back in the old days, these corridors were lined with stand-up arcade consoles, owned by the people who work in the buildings, and placed there for anybody to stop by and unwind with a game of <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Asteroids</i> or some other classic arcade game.</p>
<p> Alas, the impromptu arcade game center had to be shut down when the building safety people determined that it posed a fire safety hazard. (I suspect that the reason was not only that the machines were powered by daisy-chained extension cords, but also that safety rules required that the corridor remain clear of obstacles at all times.) </p>
