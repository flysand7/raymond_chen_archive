<p>I love it when two unrelated stories conspire to create amusement beyond what each one provided separately.
We start with this report from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> of a man on Craigslist who offered to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/20/man_fixes_pcs_in_exc.html">perform computer maintenance and repair in exchange for second base</a>. (For those not familar with North American high school sexual slang—and that includes me—I refer you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Metaphor">this schedule of bases on Wikipedia</a>, accompanied by a disturbingly elaborate list of secondary metaphors.)</p>
<p>That story provided momentary amusement, but it was subsequently recalled by this unrelated story of a man who was ruled to have been <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20471214-13762,00.html">overcharged for breast fondling</a>. If only he’d known to offer to back up their PC instead. </p>
