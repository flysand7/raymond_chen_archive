<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Taiwan law requires writing to go left-to-right instead of top-to-bottom</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  The BBC reports that  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3683825.stm">  official documents in Taiwan must now be written left-to-right  (Western style) instead of the traditional top-to-bottom</a>.  </p>
<p>  I grew up with Chinese-language newspapers that ran their stories  vertically and numbered their pages from right to left,  in the traditional manner.  Books and newspapers which run left-to-right look “wrong” to me.  But I guess I’ll have to start getting used to it.  </p>
