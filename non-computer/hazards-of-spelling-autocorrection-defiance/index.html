<p>On an internal mailing list, a colleague asked for some recommendations on a webcam.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I was wondering if there are any models I should avoid or defiantly get. </p></blockquote>
<p> I got this mental image of my colleague giving the salesperson the finger as he handed over his credit card.
 My colleague explained, “That’s an error I frequently make because Outlook by default autocorrects ‘definatly’ to ‘defiantly’ instead of ‘definitely’. You should see the reaction from my manager when he asks me to do something and I write back, ‘I’ll defiantly do that.’ I’m a terrible speller. That’s why I went into math: Only single letters.”</p>
<p> But the kicker was the end of his original message. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’ll be using Windows Live Massager. </p></blockquote>
