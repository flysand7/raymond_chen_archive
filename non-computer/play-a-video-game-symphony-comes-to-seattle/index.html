<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">PLAY! A Video Game Symphony comes to Seattle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/25/7230101.aspx"> Competing with the Miss America pageant for your Saturday evening attention</a> is <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/production.aspx?id=6074"> the Seattle performance</a> of <a href="http://www.play-symphony.com/"> <i>PLAY! A Video Game Symphony</i></a>, featuring music from <a href="http://www.play-symphony.com/program.php"> a large number of video games</a>. Presumably, the music will have something to do with the accompanying video being projected on large screens. </p>
<p> The description of the concert omits any mention of whether this is a cosplay event. Just saying. </p>
