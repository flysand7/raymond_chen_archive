<p> Taiwanese Bluetooth technology company <a href="http://www.bluetake.com/">Bluetake</a> has an odd picture on their front page. It’s three women drinking alcohol, with plenty more bottles in front of them. Not a single Bluetooth device in sight. Maybe Bluetooth just makes alcohol taste better. </p>
<p> (Yes, I know it’s a stock photo, but what’s with the alcohol?) </p>
