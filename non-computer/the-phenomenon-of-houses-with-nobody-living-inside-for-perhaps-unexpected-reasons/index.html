<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The phenomenon of houses with nobody living inside, for perhaps-unexpected reasons</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In London, some of the most expensive real estate is in neighborhoods <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/a-slice-of-london-so-exclusive-even-the-owners-are-visitors.html?_r=1"> where relatively few people actually live</a>. According to one company’s estimate, 37% of the the residences have been purchased by people who merely use them as vacation homes, visiting only for a week or two per year and leaving the building empty the remainder of the year. In other words, the people who can afford to live there choose not to.</p>
<p> This same phenomenon is reported in other cities. For example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/nyregion/paying-top-dollar-for-condos-and-leaving-them-empty.html"> only 10% of the condos in the Plaza Hotel are occupied full-time</a>. </p>
<p> Another example of a house with nobody living inside is the case where the house is a façade for an industrial building, most commonly an <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2013/02/12/faux-facades-fake-buildings-hide-trains-power-more/"> electrical substation</a> or <a href="http://www.messynessychic.com/2013/01/29/the-fake-townhouses-hiding-mystery-underground-portals/"> a subway ventilation shaft</a>. </p>
<p> I find both categories fascinating. </p>
