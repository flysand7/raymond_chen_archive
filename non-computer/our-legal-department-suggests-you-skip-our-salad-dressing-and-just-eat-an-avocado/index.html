<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Our legal department suggests you skip our salad dressing and just eat an avocado</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I saw a bottle of salad dressing with very strange fine print. <a href="http://www.briannassaladdressing.com/flavors/honey-mustard.html"> The picture on the bottle is of half an avocado</a>. But the fine print on the bottle reads “Does not contain avocados.”
 Okay, so the picture on the bottle isn’t a picture of the product. This is strange but not entirely unheard of. After all, <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/"> a box of Girl Scout cookies has pictures of Girl Scouts</a>, not cookies.
 The thing that struck me was the second half of the fine print. It reads “Serving suggestion.”
 Huh?
 Apparently, the suggested way of enjoying their salad dressing is to eat half an avocado <i>with no salad dressing on it</i>.</p>
