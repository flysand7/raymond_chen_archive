<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">France, she is, how you say, on sale!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/">Marketplace</a> reports on <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/01/12/PM200601128.html"> the start of the winter sale season in France</a>. By law, retailers are permitted sales only twice a year, so the onset of sale season generates quite a bit of shopping madness. There is also a proposal to allow more sale periods, but opponents argue that doing so would harm smaller businesses. Coming from the land of sale fatigue (we just emerged from the after-Christmas sale season and are entering the Winter White Sale season, after which comes the President’s Day season…), I find a certain appeal to the idea of limiting how often things can “go on sale”. Who can forget the oriental rug stores that are perpetually going out of business? It’s become such a joke that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/adinfo/rate_accept2.html"> The New York Times flatly refuses to run “Going Out of Business” sales for oriental rug stores</a>.</p>
