<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the fine for a basic traffic infraction in the state of Washington such a random-looking number?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/"> Willy-Peter Schaub</a> was puzzled by a sign <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2009/03/30/on-a-personal-note-strange-sign.aspx"> reminding drivers that the fine for obstructing an intersection is $101 and wonders what the extra $1 is for</a>.
 The laws of the State of Washington defer the monetary value of traffic fines to the <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.list&amp;group=clj&amp;set=IRLJ"> Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction</a> (more commonly known as the IRLJ), specifically section 6.2: <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/pdf/CLJIRLJ6.2.pdf"> Monetary Penalty Schedule for Traffic Infractions</a> [pdf].
 But wait, the fine listed in the IRLJ is only $42. Where did $101 come from?
 In addition to the base fine in the IRLJ, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=3.62.090"> RCW 3.62.090</a> specifies additional assessments: Section (1) specifies a 70% assessment for public safety and education, and section (2) specifies an additional public safety and education assessment equal to 50% of the earlier assessment. On top of that, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.63.110"> RCW 46.63.110</a> specifies various fees and penalties: Section 7(a) specifies a $5 fee for emergency services, section 7(b) specifies a $10 fee for auto theft prevention, section 7(c) specifies a $2 fee for the traumatic brain injury account, and section 8(a) specifies a $20 penalty to be shared between the state and the local jurisdiction.
 There are probably other clauses which add to the fines and penalties. I remember investigating this a few years ago and convincing myself that after taking all the fines and penalties and assessments and whatever-else-they-call-its into account, the total did come to $101. (Actually, they bring it to something close to $101, and then another rule about rounding kicks in.)</p>
<p> And you won’t get the numbers to add up to $101 any more because there were changes to the fee schedule in July 2007. The fine for basic traffic infractions is now $124. The new calculation appears to be 42 × 2.05 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 20 = $123.10, which rounds up to $124. </p>
