<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The economic inefficiency of gift-giving</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Economist Joel Waldfogel explains <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/11/podcast_happy_efficent_holiday.html"> why gift-giving is bad for the economy</a>, and why a charity gift card is the best luxury gift of all.
 He goes into more detail in his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691142645?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>Scroogenomics</i></a>, which you can buy somebody for Christmas just to tell Waldfogel where he can stick it. (“In the bank!” he’ll say as he heads out with his royalty check.)</p>
<p> <b>Related</b>: Economist Tim Harford writes an advice column called <a href="http://timharford.com/articles/deareconomist/"> <i>Dear Economist</i></a> for the <a href="http://www.ft.com/arts/columnists/timharford"> Financial Times</a>. But instead of applying economic theory to economic problems, he applies economic theory to personal problems. </p>

<p> As Harford himself explains, “Every advice columnist needs a persona, and for <i>Dear Economist</i> <a href="http://timharford.com/2009/09/the-unexpected-advice-columnist/"> it was blunt, rude, and rather fond of the latest economic research</a>.” </p>
