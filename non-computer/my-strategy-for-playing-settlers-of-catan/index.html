<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My strategy for playing Settlers of Catan</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My general strategy for playing <i>Settlers of Catan</i> is to take my unused road, settlement, and city tokens and try to build a robot out of them.</p>
<p>I have yet to win with this strategy, but I like it nevertheless.</p>
<p>(I don’t buy many development cards because I haven’t figured out how to use them to build a robot.)</p>
