<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Behind the Scenes at Mythbusters does not include experiments or explosions</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html"> <i>Mythbusters</i></a> is going on the road. Well, the show isn’t actually going on the road. Just the two hosts. In <i>Behind the Scenes at Mythbusters</i>, they go on stage to tell stories about the myth busting process, but they won’t conduct any actual experiments or blow anything up. (And therefore the reason for going to the show is what, exactly?)</p>
