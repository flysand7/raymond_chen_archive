<p> <a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~cliff/cliff.php"> Cliff Mass</a> is Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington. To those of us in the Seattle area, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2008452574_mass010.html"> he’s a weather celebrity</a>, appearing <a href="http://www.kuow.org/program.php?id=20295"> every Friday on local public radio station KUOW</a> to provide a weekend weather forecast and discuss other weather issues. <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/"> His blog</a> covers similar material, such as his explanation of <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2010/05/there-is-bird-in-my-radar.html"> why weather radar shows lots of echoes even though there was no rain</a>. </p>
<p> His articles, while fascinating, are also quite long, so to help you get through them, there is the <a href="http://cliffmasstldr.blogspot.com/"> Cliff Mass TLDR blog</a>. For example, <a href="http://cliffmasstldr.blogspot.com/2010/05/radar-is-picking-up-birds-instead-of.html"> the TLDR version of the mysterious echoes goes like this</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>The radar is picking up birds instead of rain</b><br/> It’s been dry, but the weather radar last night showed lots of echos, suggesting it rained all night. No, it was just birds.  </p></blockquote>
<p> <b>Explaining the joke in the title</b>: “Cliff Notes” is a pun on <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/">CliffsNotes</a>, a United States producer of study guides. </p>
