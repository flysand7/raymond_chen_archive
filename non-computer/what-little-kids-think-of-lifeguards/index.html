<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What little kids think of lifeguards</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We had extended family over for a visit, and we decided to take everybody to the public swimming pool. While waiting in line, the kids (ages 4 through 7) somehow got onto the topic of lifeguards. </p>
<p>Six-year-old: “I hate lifeguards. Whenever you do something fun, they tell you to stop.” </p>
<p>Four-year-old: “I hate lifeguards, too. They made me stop hopping. But I didn’t fall down! When I grow up, I want to be a lifeguard, so I can yell at people.” </p>
