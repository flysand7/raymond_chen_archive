<p> After the Windows 95 project was released to manufacturing, but before the launch event itself, the team finally had a chance to relax and unwind after many years of hard work. The project manager decided to have a morale event to get everyone together to do something fun. A typical morale event might be going to see a baseball game, renting out a movie theater to watch the latest action flick, or something as simple as a picnic or a softball game. </p>
<p> But this time, the project manager decided to do something different, something wild, something crazy, something everybody would talk about for days: He bought everyone tickets to the monster truck rally. (And he bought the whole seat, even though we’d only need the edge.) </p>
