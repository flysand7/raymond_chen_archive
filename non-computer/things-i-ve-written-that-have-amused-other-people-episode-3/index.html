<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Things I've written that have amused other people, Episode 3</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In an internal discussion of the women blogger conference known as <a href="http://blogher.org/about-blogher-conference-06">BlogHer</a>, somebody asked, “Why isn’t there a BlogHim?” I replied,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Isn’t that the plural of the word “blog” in Hebrew? </p></blockquote>
<p> This got quite an amused response from the Hebrew-speaking (or at least vaguely Hebrew-aware) members of the mailing list.</p>
<p> Not bad for having studied Hebrew for about ten seconds. (Apparently a better spelling of the plural would be “blogim” or “bloggim”. But it wouldn’t have been as funny.) </p>
