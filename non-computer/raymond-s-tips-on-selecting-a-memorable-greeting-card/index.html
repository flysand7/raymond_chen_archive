<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond's tips on selecting a memorable greeting card</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My favorite greeting card is one I got from <a href="http://www.wendyhome.com/"> :: Wendy ::</a>. It was a Christmas card with <a href="http://www.galison.com/Snow-in-Kazan-Holiday-Cards-P614C203.aspx"> a picture of kids running around while snow fell all around them</a>. Wendy added the message, “Watch out for that ‘rogue’ snowball from midfield…” I still have that card on my windowsill years later.
 My recommendation for choosing a memorable greeting card is to go to the wrong aisle in the greeting card store. I always start with the “blank cards” aisle since you can look for a picture that sets an interesting scene (like Wendy’s snowball fight) and then add a short message inside.</p>
<p> Last year, I went to the Sympathy aisle to get a birthday card for a friend who was trying not to show his concern over turning 30. After some searching, I found the perfect card. It was your usual sappy sympathy card with flowers and birds on the cover and some text about peace and comfort. And on the inside, it simply said, “Hope you feel better soon.” I added, “Happy birthday.” </p>
