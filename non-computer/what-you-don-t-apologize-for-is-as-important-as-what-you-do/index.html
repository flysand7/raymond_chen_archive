<p> In the aftermath of the Zidane head-butt incident, there was a lot of <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003141649_digs21.html"> speculation over what Materazzi might have said to provoke Zidane’s response</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Zidane has said he attacked Materazzi because he insulted his mother and sister. Materazzi denied disparaging Zidane’s mother. </p></blockquote>
<p> I immediately noticed the very precise denial from Materazzi. (I suspect any parent would recognize the same thing.) And <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soccer/2003244128_webzidane05.html"> my suspicion was vindicated earlier this week</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Italy’s Marco Materazzi said he insulted Zinedine Zidane’s sister. </p></blockquote>
