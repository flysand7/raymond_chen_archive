<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to tell when your patent has been approved</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> There are a variety of ways of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bgroth/archive/2008/07/01/i-finally-got-my-patent.aspx"> finding out when your patent is granted</a>, but the quickest mechanism is to check your mailbox. But the thing to look for is not what you might think. </p>
<p> Even before you receive word from your company’s patent department, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robch/archive/2007/05/03/my-first-patent.aspx"> you will start receiving junk mail delivered to your home address</a> from companies that sell patent-related novelties, pointless trinkets like pencils and mugs with your patent number on it. Nevermind that you can probably order personalized pencils for much less than what the patent-chasers were offering. </p>
