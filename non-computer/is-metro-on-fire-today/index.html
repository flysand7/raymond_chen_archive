<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/dramatic-video-shows-fire-dc-metro/story?id=38925609">Two fires in one day</a> in the Washington, DC Metro inspired a single-serving-site: <a href="https://ismetroonfiretoday.com/">ismetroonfiretoday.com</a>. </p>
<p>Answers the question on the tin. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: One of my friends told me that a few jobs ago, the project he worked on had a problem with people checking changes into the project when the tree was supposed to be locked. And by “people”, he meant “pretty much just one guy in particular”. At a team meeting convened to discuss the problem, he somewhat sarcastically asked, “What do you want? A Web site called isthecontosotreelocked.com?” </p>
<p>The other developer said, “Hey, that’s a great idea.” </p>
<p>So my friend pulled out his credit card and bought the domain isthecontosotreelocked.com, and uploaded a one-word page: “No.” </p>
<p><b>Update</b>: There’s another site <a href="https://www.ismetroonfire.com/">ismetroonfire.com</a> that claims to derive its fire/no-fire information by monitoring Twitter. </p>
