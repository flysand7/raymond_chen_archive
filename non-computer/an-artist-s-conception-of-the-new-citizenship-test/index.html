<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An artist’s conception of the new citizenship test</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Today is the first day of the controversial <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/natzpilot"> redesigned United States citizenship examination</a>. For the next year, candidates who applied before today can choose whether they want to use the old test or the new one. </p>
<p> To help prepare for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13442226/"> the new examination</a>, I propose the following warm-up, which I tested (with the assistance of another United States citizen) on a foreign national, a Canadian from British Columbia, so there should be no language barrier as long as we are careful to avoid the word <i>about</i>. </p>
<ol>
<li>What condiment applies to French-fried potatoes? </li>
<li>Which fires a bigger bullet, a nine or a twenty-two? </li>
<li>Does the metric system suck? </li>
<li>How long is a football field?     (Note: Answering in metric or confusing <i>football</i>     with <i>soccer</i> are automatic disqualifications.) </li>
<li>Define <i>class action lawsuit</i>. </li>
<li>True or false: You have a God-given right to drink alcohol     until you pass out. </li>
</ol>
<p> Here are the answers the Canadian gave, along with my response and additional commentary from my co-examiner in blue. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p> <i>What condiment applies to French-fried potatoes?</i><br/>     Vinegar… no, mayonnaise… no wait, it’s that red stuff.     </p>
<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     No credit for not being able to name the red stuff.     Negative points for even <i>thinking</i> of the words     <i>vinegar</i> or <i>mayonnaise</i>.     </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p> <i>Which fires a bigger bullet, a nine or a twenty-two?</i><br/>     That’s what the NRA’s 1-800 number is for, when you need to know, right?     </p>
<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     No credit. Every American knows the hierarchy of firearms.     </p>
<p> <font color="blue">Least all <i>real</i> Americans.</font> </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p> <i>Does the metric system suck?</i><br/>     Gol-dang right (scratch)     </p>
<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     Ding.     </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p> <i>How long is a football field?</i><br/>     328.08 feet     </p>
<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     Bzzzt. Americans don’t use decimal points and feet in the same     sentence. That’s treading dangerously close to that heathen     <i>metric system</i>.     </p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p> <i>Define</i> class action lawsuit<i>.</i><br/>     When more than one American at once abuses the legal system.     </p>
<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     Close.     It’s when one American abuses the legal system     <i>on behalf of all Americans</i>.     </p>
<p> <font color="blue">     Unless I am doing it, in which case it isn’t abuse.     </font> </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p> <i>True or false: You have a God-given right to drink alcohol     until you pass out.</i><br/>     False, because no state law is allowed to refer to God, right?     </p>

<blockquote style="border: dotted black .75pt;padding: 1ex"><p>     Incorrect.     You are allowed to refer to God, despite what the ACLU says.     Americans are endowed by their Creator with several     inalienable rights.     Among them are the rights to drink alcohol,     discharge firearms,     belch,     swear, and     make obscene gestures.     </p>
<p> <font color="blue">     You left out scratch and drive.     </font> </p>
