<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dr. Watson and the bluescreen – a story from the trenches</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A fellow Microsoft employee volunteered a story from his prior work at a hospital as their enterprise architect. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> I received an escalation from our Tier 1 service desk on a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449866.aspx"> Dr. Watson</a>. Why would I get a simple escalation? Strange… </p>
<p> Since I hadn’t seen the outside of my cubicle for a while, I decided to walk over to talk to the customer in person. </p>
<p> The employee having the problem was named Dr. Watson. His computer had bluescreened. </p>
