<p>For a while, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/22/162361.aspx"> our cafeteria</a> was trying to sell three-packs of bottled water. A sign proudly announced:</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p align="CENTER"><b>Drink more water: What you should know about H<sub>2</sub>O</b></p>
<p>  Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Make it easy. Carry a bottle of water when you commute to work or run errands. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> This is what I should know about H<sub>2</sub>O? </p>
<p> “Drink more water”:  Notice that they didn’t specify a target amount. Just drink more. </p>
<p> “Carry a bottle of water when you commute”: I should drive with one hand on the wheel and the other hand clutching a bottle of water? Isn’t that dangerous? </p>
<p> And who is providing this “helpful” information? </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Source: International Bottled Water Association </p></blockquote>
<p> Hardly an impartial organization. </p>
