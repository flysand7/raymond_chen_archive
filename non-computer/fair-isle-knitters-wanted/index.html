<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Fair Isle: Knitters Wanted</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The National Trust of Scotland has <a href="http://www.fairisle.org.uk/property.htm"> two houses to let on the island of Fair Isle</a>, population: 65. The two properties are available at a very reasonable rate of only £300. Per year. Although the National Trust does not promise a job, it points out that there are skill shortages in construction and <a href="http://www.shetland-museum.org.uk/collections/textiles/fair_isle_knitting.htm"> knitting</a>. <a href="http://www.fairisle.org.uk/fairislecrafts/index.htm"> The knitting cooperative</a> apparently has more orders than it can fill. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4866217">You can listen to the entire story and find a link to the original advertisement on NPR’s web site</a>.)</p>
<p> (Alas, <a href="http://heritage.scotsman.com/news.cfm?id=2084032005"> the deadline for applications has passed</a>. That NPR story led to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1837094,00.html"> an avalanche of interest from the United States</a>, mostly from knitters.) </p>
<p> This story reminded me that my friend <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/thewendyhouse/"> Wendy</a> made money on the side in her younger days doing hand knitting. I wonder how many people bought a lovely English hand-knitted sweater imagining it having been created by a sweet old lady in a rocking chair, when in fact it was done by a fifteen-year-old girl with a shaved head and an attitude while sitting in front of the telly watching <i><a href="http://www.ultimatedallas.com/">Dallas</a></i>. </p>
