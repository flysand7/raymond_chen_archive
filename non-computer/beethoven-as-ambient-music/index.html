<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Beethoven as ambient music</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Who knew that  <a href="http://www.notam02.no/9/">Beethoven wrote ambient music</a>?
  The people at NOTAM took Beethoven’s 9th Symphony and slowed it down  so that the entire performance takes 24 hours.  It’s actually quite nice  to listen to.  (I like  <a href="http://varpid.simnet.is/9bs/b921.mp3">2.1</a> myself.)
  [Rats,  <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32510">scooped by MetaFilter</a>.  Honest, it was in my queue!  Nobody will believe me; they’ll think  I swiped it from MeFi…]</p>
<p>  A few months ago,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1724372">  NPR covered a similar experiment with the movie <i>Psycho</i></a>.  I think it was a little less successful.  </p>
