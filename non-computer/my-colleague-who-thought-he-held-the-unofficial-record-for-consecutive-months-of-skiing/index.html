<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My colleague who thought he held the unofficial record for consecutive months of skiing</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve written about my colleague Danny <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161004-00/?p=94445">before</a>. He’s an accomplished skier, and one of the things he maintained was a tradition of going skiing at least once every month. He jokingly claimed that he held the unofficial record for consecutive months of skiing. <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/snow-obsessed-danny-miller-has-skied-every-month-since-1993/">A recent profile in the <i>Seattle Times</i></a> points out that this is a tradition he has been continuing for 23 years. </p>
<p>As the article notes, Danny thought he was the only person with such an unusual streak, until he discovered <a href="http://www.turns-all-year.com/">an entire community of like-minded skiers</a>. </p>
<p>As the article notes, whether he holds the unofficial record for consecutive months of skiing is not really the point, because every skier sets their own criterion for what counts as a “day of skiing”. </p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, he holds the record. Not that it really matters. </p>
