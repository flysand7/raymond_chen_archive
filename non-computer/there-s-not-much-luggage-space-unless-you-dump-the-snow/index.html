<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">There's not much luggage space, unless you dump the snow</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Every year, <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/"> <i>Road and Track</i></a> magazine reviews a strange vehicle in their April edition. Last year, it was <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?article_id=3386"> the 1949 MG TC</a>. But my favorite is their 2005 review of <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?article_id=2091"> the Zamboni 500</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> [T]he Zamboni leaves the line with alacrity (revved to its 3000-rpm redline), rockets up to 9.7 mph and then stays at exactly that speed for the full 200-ft. length of the rink. Those old myths that you will “black out” or “be unable to breathe” at speeds above 9.5 mph proved to be completely untrue. I was perfectly comfortable, once I got over the excitement, and felt no ill effects then or later. </p>
<p> There’s not much luggage space, unless you dump the snow, and $50,000 is a lot of money for any sport ute with a top speed of only 9.7 mph. </p>
