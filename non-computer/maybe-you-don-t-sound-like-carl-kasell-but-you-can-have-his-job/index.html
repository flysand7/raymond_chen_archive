<p> According to the wonderful <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5251026"> Mixed Signals</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5323281"> the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is searching for radio hosts</a>. They’re calling it “American Idol for public radio”. </p>
<p> I recently stumbled across Mixed Signals and was instantly hooked. Some of my recent favorites: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294997"> Mike Pesca reports from South Dakota</a> on the simple frugality of the state capitol building. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295188"> An executive order establishing the order of succession</a> in the case the Archivist of the United States and the Deputy Archivist of the United States are both unable to perform the functions and duties of the office of Archivist. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5298435"> Mike Pesca runs afoul of some park rangers at Mount Rushmore</a>. For some reason, Mike Pesca has the perfect voice for this type of stuff. He always sounds slightly annoyed and a bit condescending. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5303729"> An insurance company withdraws coverage from an animal charity</a> because their building is too close to a luxury apartment building whose only famous residents are “a couple of lingerie models”. (There is even a response from the insurance company that didn’t really seem to explain much.) </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5312224"> Riding elevators in order to secure press credentials</a> because security regulations prohibit forming a line. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5316792"> Mike Pesca again (sense a pattern?) sets the record straight on GMU’s surprise performance in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament</a>. </li>
<li> One last Mike Pesca story: <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5228264"> This (somewhat misguided) essay on Iceland’s lack of success at… um… ice sports</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/01/170857.aspx"> Icelandic sits at the bottom of my list of Germanic languages to learn</a> (but at least it’s doing better than Danish, which doesn’t make the list at all). </li>
</ul>
<p> The curatorship of Mixed Signals appears to change hands rather frequently. The last few entries I linked above were from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101217"> Robert Smith</a>, whom I had the pleasure to meet at KUOW studios when he was stationed in Seattle. </p>
