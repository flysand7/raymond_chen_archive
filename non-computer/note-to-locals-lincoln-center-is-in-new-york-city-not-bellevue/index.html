<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Note to locals: Lincoln Center is in New York City, not Bellevue</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In downtown Bellevue there is a mall named <a href="http://www.lincoln-square.com/"> Lincoln Square</a>, but I hear people refer to it with some frequency as Lincoln Center.
 Just a reminder: <a href="http://www.lincolncenter.org/">Lincoln Center</a> is in New York City.
 <b>Nitpicker’s corner</b></p>
<p> There are many other places in the world with the names Lincoln Square and Lincoln Center. </p>
