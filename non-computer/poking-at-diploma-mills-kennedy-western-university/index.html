<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Poking at diploma mills: Kennedy-Western University</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I enjoy poking around diploma mills. Especially the ones that spam my inbox. Like Kennedy-Western University, which <a href="http://www.kw.edu/media.asp?active=media"> describes itself</a> like so:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Since 1984 Kennedy-Western University (KWU) has provided distance and online degree programs to over 30,000 students. KWU is one of the largest non-accredited online universities in the United States. … </p></blockquote>
<p> Ah, the magic word: “non-accredited”. Translation: “Bogus”. </p>
<p> But hey, being non-accredited can’t be all bad, right? After all, KWU seems to be proud of the fact that it isn’t accredited. </p>
<p> Read on: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Three of four of its faculty of 140 credentialed professors – who are simultaneously employed by major traditional universities throughout the country – hold Ph.D. degrees from accredited universities. </p></blockquote>
<p> Oops, they’re undermining their own statement. Isn’t it kind of suspicious that they are bragging that their faculty is so good, they got their degrees from <strong>real</strong> universities (unlike this one)? </p>
<p> My personal favorite diploma mill is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/school/0,1383,35068,00.html"> Harrington University</a>. It’s fun kicking off <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=resume+education+%22harrington+university%22"> a Google search to see how many people put a degree from that institution on their résumé</a>. </p>
<p> If you scroll down a bit on this Swedish web page, you’ll find <a href="http://www.nyteknik.se/bluffuniversitet.html"> a picture of the building that houses so-called Brentwick University</a>. The photo caption reads, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Brentwick University</b> claims to be on 196 High Street in northern London. This is what it looks like. On the second floor, over the dry cleaner’s, lies Cordon Bell Accomodation Agency, a firm which serves as a maildrop and forwards mail on behalf of a series of camera-shy companies, among them “Brentwick University”. </p></blockquote>
<p> It’s a somewhat regular scandal in the United States that somebody well-known will be <a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/gray/gray6.html"> exposed</a> to have been <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0514041swan1.html"> claiming a degree</a> that was obtained <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=13075"> by dubious means</a>. </p>
