<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A $2 billion bridge to one person</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><i>The New York Times</i> reported on  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/10/national/10ALAS.html">  two enormous construction projects of dubious merit</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>    [The first bridge]  would connect [Ketchikan, population 7845]  to an island that has about 50 residents and the area’s airport,  which offers six flights a day (a few more in summer).  It could cost about $200 million.  </p>
<p>  The other bridge would span an inlet for nearly  two miles to tie Anchorage to a port  that has a single regular tenant and almost no homes or businesses.  It would cost up to $2 billion.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The first bridge replaces a five minute ferry ride  with a drive that most likely will take even longer.</p>
<p>  And the representative from Alaska behind these pointless  construction projects is hardly ashamed of this.  Quite the contrary:  He’s proud of his achievement.  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  “I stuffed it like a turkey.”  </p></blockquote>
<p>  United States politics is not about trying to make the world a better  place.  It’s about doing whatever it takes to get re-elected.  </p>
