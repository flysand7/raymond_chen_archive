<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Male perceptions of body image in Taiwan</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few years ago, researchers started with “muscle dysmorphia” and body-image perceptions in the United States and Europe and wondered <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4536230"> whether the same problems afflict Taiwanese men</a>. Listen for the results. But don’t be confused by the chicken meat (肌肉).
 Sean Cole interviews Taiwanese pop star <a href="http://www.ameiclub.com/"> A-Mèi</a> for her opinion. I remember a story in CNN some years ago on the singer, and it referred to her as “Ms. Mei”.
 Um, that’s not right.</p>
<p> In Taiwanese, the “A-” prefix is used to form nicknames; compare English which appends “-y” for the same purpose. In English, “Mike” becomes “Mikey”; in Taiwanese, “Huì-Mèi” becomes “A-Mèi”. If you want to refer to her formally, it’s “Ms. Chang”. Using “Ms. Mei” would be like referring to the musician Eddie Van Halen as “Mr. Ed”. </p>
