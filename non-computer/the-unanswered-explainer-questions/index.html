<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The unanswered Explainer questions</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=3944&amp;cp=1787"> Slate’s Explainer column</a> answers questions about current events. Sometimes they do it multiple times, as they did when I asked them how to pronounce the name Pinochet and they said <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/1001989/"> Pee-no-CHAY</a>, then later corrected themselves with <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2131164/"> pin-oh-CHET</a>, and then again re-corrected themselves with <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2155292/"> Yes</a>.
 Yesterday, the Explainer provided <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2155836/"> a selection of the questions they received and didn’t answer</a> and invited the readers to vote on which one they would like to see answered. My favorite question was the one that begins “I have a sister that stresses the hell out of me,” and goes on and on about the car accident, how her sister complains and complains, how she had to tell the sister to stop bugging her with her problems, I mean, I was in a car accident, and concludes, “I really need to know if a person can really stress you out with the same old thing over and over and over again. PLEASE ANSWER BACK ASAP.” Comedy gold. If you made this stuff up people would say it was too unrealistic.</p>
<p> As for which one I would actually like answered, I don’t know. They’re all so goofy, and the answer wouldn’t be all that enlightening. </p>
