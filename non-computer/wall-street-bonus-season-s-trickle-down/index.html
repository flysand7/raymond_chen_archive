<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Wall Street bonus season's trickle-down</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/"> <i>Marketplace</i></a> covers <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/12/28/PM200612287.html"> the businesses who are indirect beneficiaries of the Wall Street bonus season</a>. Ted Fisher, who sells custom-tailored clothing, sees 35 to 40% of his business come in during the three months of bonus season. I suspect business near Redmond are similarly affected by Microsoft review season, though perhaps not as much now as before.</p>
