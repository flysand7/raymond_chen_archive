<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Baking soda has hundreds of uses, but what about what it says on the tin?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My mother bought a giant bag of baking soda in order to deodorize some carpet. She had some left over and wondered if it was food grade. The bag said, “Hundreds of uses!” and listed all sorts of uses for baking soda. “Baking” was not on the list. </p>
<p><b>Follow-up</b>: She called the manufacturer. It is safe for baking, too. </p>
