<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Storsjöodjur hunting season will opening soon</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Scotland doesn’t have the corner on monsters in lakes. You’ll also find them <a href="http://www.mjoesormen.no/roemsj%C3%B8en%20lake.htm"> in Norway</a>, <a href="http://www.storsjoodjuret.com/"> in Sweden</a> (read about a recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/152368.stm">expedition</a>), and <a href="http://www.ogopogo.org/"> in Canada</a>, among many, many others. Anywhere there are lakes, there’s bound to be a legend about a monster in one of them.</p>
<p> It appears, however that <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=29&amp;art_id=qw1094657582382B232"> Sweden’s Storsjöodjur is about to lose its protected species status</a>, owing to an inquiry inspired by <a href="http://www.100megsfree4.com/farshores/c04mon1.htm"> a man’s request to harvest the creature’s eggs so he can hatch them</a>. </p>
<p> As a result, it will soon be open season on Storsjöodjuret. Happy hunting. </p>
<p> (I find the Swedish word <cite>odjur</cite> somewhat poetic. It translates as “monster” but literally means “un-animal”.) </p>
