<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Inserting as many layers between the message and reality as possible</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago I received a message that described a situation that was “based on a reality-based scenario.”
 Wow, how many layers away from reality can you get?
 It wasn’t a real scenario.
 It wasn’t a reality-based scenario.
 It was <i>based on</i> a reality-based scenario.</p>
<p> Then again, I’m just adding to the problem. I’m writing a message <i>about</i> a situation based on a reality-based scenario… </p>
