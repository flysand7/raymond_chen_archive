<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The more I learn about Sweden, the weirder it gets</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         It must be really boring in Sweden in the winter. Things to do:      </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/peckas/kick.htm">Speed across the snow at 70kph by             strapping a paraglider engine to your back</a>.          </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/rundown.php?prgDate=17-Oct-2003&amp;prgId=17">Eat             rancid herring and call it a delicacy</a>. (Fourth story.)          </li>
<li>             Defend the northern border against invasion.          </li>
</ul>
<p>         Military service in Sweden is compulsory for all males. When your country has not         participated in any wars for two hundred years, you have to pass the time somehow.         Apparently one of the exercises is to assess how Sweden would fare against its nearest         neighbors. The general consensus (at least in Sweden) is that they could take on Finland         and Norway, but if the Danes were to invade, Sweden would eventually succumb, but         not before doing the Danish army serious damage.      </p>
<p> Pass the herring. </p>
