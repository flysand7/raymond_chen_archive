<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Rob Cockerham investigates those companies that pay cash for gold</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Rob Cockerham seems to have a lot of spare time, which is great for the rest of us, because he investigates all those things we simply don’t have the time for, and then posts the results <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/"> on his Web site</a> (“The sixth-best website in the world”). </p>
<p> Today’s highlight is a pair of investigations he performed some time ago which seem to show two sides of one industry. </p>
<ul>
<li>In     <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/gold_kit.shtml">     The Gold Kit Surprise</a>,     he sprays some worthless junk with gold paint and sends it in.     Just writing that sentence made me laugh with anticipation     and I haven’t even gotten to the punch line yet.     Read it through. </li>
<li>In     <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/cheat.shtml">     Cash4Gold Will Offer One-Third of the Actual Value for your Gold</a>,     he sends actual gold to Cash4Gold to see how much they offer for it.     Well, the title gives away the punch line,     but it’s still worth reading. </li>
</ul>
<p> That Web site is a sinkhole of time-wastage. If you’re not careful, you’ll find yourself clicking around from story to story, like the <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html"> How much is inside?</a> adventures, in which he investigates things like <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/threadcount/threadcount01.shtml"> how many threads per inch are there in 360-thread count pillowcases?</a> Or his <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/incredible/incredible.html"> gallery of costumes</a> (for Hallowe’en or other events), including my favorite: <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/incredible/paparazzi/paparazzi.html"> Paparazzi</a>. </p>
