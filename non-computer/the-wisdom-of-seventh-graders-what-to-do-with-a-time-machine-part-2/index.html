<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of seventh graders: What to do with a time machine (part 2)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>(Make sure you’ve read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/04/1205832.aspx"> Part 1</a> for background information.)
 On the subject of where they would go in a time machine, many students wrote well-thought-out essays, beautifully composed.
 These sentences below did not come from those essays.
 I’ve categorized the snippets roughly by theme, though I had to guess at some of them since the sentences are taken out of context. (In a futile attempt to assist non-native speakers, I have glossed some of the trickier parts. I’ve also added editorial comments in italics.)
 <b>Introductions</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I would be honored to     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="try">     trie</span> the time machine </li>
<li>I am highly regarded to be selected to     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="engage">engorge</span> this experimental journey. </li>
<li>At the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="The usual phrase is 'crack of dawn'. This student chose a more student-friendly starting time.">     crack of noon</span>, we will begin our mission. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Personal History</b>: These are essays from students who would     travel to their own past.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 5th grade you are at the top of the school,     and you feel the power     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="overcome">     over come</span> you. </li>
<li>Now, if we fall asleep in class we get in trouble.     But in kindergarten if we didn’t fall asleep we would get in trouble. </li>
<li>She would work in little     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="orchards">orchids</span> picking fruit for her family. </li>
<li>I have 4 things in my life.     Soccer, family, God, and school. In that order. </li>
<li>If I could find a way to impel paranormal powers     to ignite in ones body     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="enabling">     enableing</span>     them to do incredible feats,     I would be ecstatic to the point of bliss.     (<i>This same student wanted Jesus to teach him how     to walk on water.     This student also wanted control over magnetism.     I think he needs to lay off the     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men">     X-Men</a> comics for a while.</i>) </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>The Middle Ages</b>: The students recently studied the Middle Ages, which helps to explain why so many of them chose to go there. </p>
<ul>
<li>And at that time in history,     everything was changing     either for the good or the bad.     (<i>Whoa there, let’s not say anything too controversial now</i>.) </li>
<li>In Europe during the 1700’s there were 5 sections in the social class:     1=Monarchs, 2=Lords &amp; Nobles, 3=knights,     4=<span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="peasants">pheasants</span>.     (<i>What happened to number five?</i>) </li>
<li>I find Middle Aged Europe very stimulating. </li>
<li>France is near water so I will feel more at home. </li>
<li>We have recently     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="discussed">disgust</span> the Middle Ages.  </li>
<li>King Arthur may have won some battles without the use of fiction. </li>
<li>In 1550 I would choose to go to Spain because nobody really lived in     N. American then. </li>
<li>I would learn a lot     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="going">gong</span>     to the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Medieval">Midieval</span> times.     I would even come back and write     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="an">and</span> essay about it! </li>
<li>I’d have benefit in watching a mock battle     between two knights on horseback with lances.     (<i>I may be wrong, but I think the battles in the Middle Ages     were for real</i>.) </li>
<li>It was sick and     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="gruesome">grusm</span> but really a thing to remember. </li>
<li>And I would go to     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Britain">Britan</span> because Britan was     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="popular">populare</span> back in 1616. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>United States(?) History</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Also, to investigate how the family worked [in Pilgrim times],     to see if they fought less because they had no appliances to fight over. </li>
<li>If I could go anywhere I would choose Boston, England. </li>
<li>I want to see what happened when Ben Franklin flew his kite in the rain.     For this reason I would go to England. </li>
<li>Though War is Hell, I still would be anxious to see a real one.     (<i>Try watching the evening news</i>.) </li>
<li>I wish the     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">     great depression</a>, but it did.     (<i>Even after you fill in the missing words, it’s still funny</i>.) </li>
<li>Because California is a very interesting and mindblowing city. </li>
<li>In 1961 everything including life was simple. </li>
<li>Hopefully the president at their time isn’t an idiot and     stops the first power plant ever built. </li>
<li>I want to     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="see">se</span>     the Great     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Bambino">Babino</span> Babe     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Ruth">Bruth</span>. </li>
<li>Besides the     <a href="http://www.steelers.com/">Stealer</a>     fans nobody like the Stealers. </li>
<li>It was like a family     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="reunion">runnun</span> at disneyland. </li>
</ul>
<p> I’ll stop here before I <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="run on">runnun</span> too much. We’ll learn more about seventh graders and time machines in the next installment. </p>
