<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happens to your restaurant tip?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Some time ago, the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/"> <i>Seattle Times</i></a> ran an article on <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2003826000_taste08.html"> how your restaurant tip gets divided up among the staff</a>. A week later, they ran an entire article of <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/restaurants/2003836291_taste15.html"> responses to the original article</a>, some from customers, but many from restaurant staff (both cooks and servers). And, now on a roll, the next week’s food section looked at <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2003847096_billsplitting22.html"> the sociology of splitting the bill</a> with a sidebar looking at <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/foodwine/2003848168_billsplittingside22.html"> how hard it is for different types of restaurants</a>.</p>
