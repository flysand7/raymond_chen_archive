<p> My friend <a href="http://www.wendyhome.com/">::Wendy::</a> decided that going off topic in the comments to this Web site was so much fun, she didn’t want to let the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/21/77681.aspx"> Ground Rules</a> stop her. So she created the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/off-roading-the-old-new-thing/"> Off-Roading The Old New Thing</a> group, where people who get a thrill out of going off topic can do so without running afoul of this Web site’s Ground Rules. </p>
<p> Have fun, everybody! </p>
