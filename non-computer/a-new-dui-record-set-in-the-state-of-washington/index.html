<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A new DUI record set in the state of Washington</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In case you missed it, a former Seattle police detective was arrested in early 2007 for driving with <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003672880_webalcohol19m.html"> a state record high blood-alcohol level of 0.47 percent</a>. (The legal limit is 0.08 percent, most people black out at 0.35 percent, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content#Effects_at_different_levels"> 0.40 percent is lethal for 50% of adults</a>.) She was subsequently <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003674033_drinking20m.html"> arrested and held on $250,000 bail</a> (story contains other history of Ms. Jarrett). Bail was <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003678503_jarrett24e.html"> increased to $300,000</a> a week later, with another hearing scheduled for May for… a separate DUI case. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003723017_jarrett26e.html"> At the May hearing, the initial attempt by the driver’s attorneys to release their client to a treatment center failed</a>, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003734685_dige05m.html"> a second attempt succeeded</a> (second story).
 And then that’s it. No more news I can find. I suspect we’ll never learn whether the treatment program was deemed a success.</p>
<p> Just as that saga appears to be winding down, a new one appears to be starting up: In neighbor state Oregon, a person with multiple drunken driving convictions was discovered with <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004094566_webdui27m.html"> a blood alcohol level of a stunning 0.55 percent</a>. </p>
