<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When somebody says a game is like chess, it is usually completely unlike chess</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Chess has become elevated to the gold standard of board games. Everybody wishes their game had the cultural gravity of chess, a game whose mere mention elevates you to the category of <i>deep thinker</i> and <i>profound strategist</i>. (We’ll set aside the scrawny glasses-wearing nerd part for now.)</p>
<p> I’ve learned that when somebody says a game is like chess, it’s pretty much guaranteed that the game in fact bears no resemblance to chess whatsoever. </p>
<p> I came to this realization when somebody pulled out a game with a strange-looking board with what looked like plastic volcanoes glued to the surface, catwalks, and a lazy susan. Each player was represented by a token, set in its respective starting position. I asked, “Hey, what’s this game?” </p>
<p> The person replied, “It’s a lot like chess. First you <a href="http://www.stern.de/em2008/fotostrecken/allgemein/:Fu%DFballer-Spr%FCche-Wie-Schach-W%FCrfel/622828.html?cp=23"> roll the dice</a>…” </p>
