<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Stuff my father-in-law says: On taking the train</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My father-in-law was planning on taking the train to the airport. He heard that the train comes every ten minutes. By his calculations, then, he could catch the 7:50 train and be at the airport by 7:55. </p>
<p>Reasoning: Since the train comes every ten minutes, then it must take five minutes to get to the airport, and five minutes to come back. </p>
<p>Logic! </p>
<p>(If true, then it means that the train travels at around 170mph ≈ 270kph.) </p>
