<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Canoeing around the Washington Park Arboretum</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This weekend is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/08/592352.aspx"> Opening Day of the Seattle boating season</a>. Even if you don’t own a boat, you can enjoy the warmer weather and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/getaways/313860_shorttrips03.html"> rent a canoe</a> and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/getaways/217951_arboretumpaddle31.html"> paddle around the Arboretum</a>. (Don’t do it on Opening Day, though.)
 Here’s <a href="http://www.nwoc.com/rental/arb_detail/index.htm"> a nice map</a> courtesy of the <a href="http://www.nwoc.com/"> Northwest Outdoor Center</a>. Pay heed to avoid the green section marked <i>Caution</i>. I made a wrong turn and ended up in the Caution area, and I found myself slogging through very shallow water.
 Assuming you avoid the shallows, it’s a very pleasant experience. Commune with the ducks and other birds. Pull over at one of the beaches and take a lunch break (assuming you remembered to pack lunch). Wave at the cars stuck on the 520 bridge.</p>
