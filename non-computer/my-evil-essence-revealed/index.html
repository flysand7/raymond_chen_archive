<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My evil essence revealed</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I found it amusing that somebody considered the fact that Microsoft employees can read my queued-up blog entries before the articles are published to be <a href="http://mejedi.livejournal.com/45367.html"> further evidence of Microsoft’s evil essence as a monopoly</a>. </p>
<p> Just for the record, this is not evidence of Microsoft’s evil essence as a monopoly. Rather, it’s evidence of <i>Raymond’s</i> evil essence as a monopoly, because the monopoly on <i>blog articles written by Raymond Chen that haven’t yet been published</i> belongs to me. </p>
