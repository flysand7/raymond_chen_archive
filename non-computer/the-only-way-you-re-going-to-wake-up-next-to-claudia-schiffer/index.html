<p>Dominic O’Brien,  world speed-memorization champion, on  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/08/23/mind.olympiad/">  his technique for memorizing over 18 decks of shuffled cards in an hour</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  “I remember things by personalising them,” explains O’Brien, 43.  “With playing cards, for instance, I memorise each one as a face.  The queen of hearts I think of as Claudia Schiffer,  the ace of clubs as Nick Faldo.  To get them in sequence I then imagine a journey,  say from home to work, and fit the different people into that journey.  So for example I wake up beside Claudia Schiffer,  get out of bed and trip over Nick Faldo. It’s very effective.”   </p></blockquote>

<p>  Other scintillating competitions include  “memorizing random digits” and (from 1997)  “listing as many similarities as you can think of  between the Princess of Wales and an orange.”  </p>
