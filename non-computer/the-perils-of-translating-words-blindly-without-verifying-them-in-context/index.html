<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The perils of translating words blindly without verifying them in context</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My fancy new office phone has an option to change the language of its user interface, so naturally I chose Swedish. Once I did that, I saw some obvious translation errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Edit</i> command was called <i>Bearb…</i>     instead of <i>Redig…</i>.     Apparently, the Swedish translation was created by starting with     the German version, and they missed a spot and left a word in German     (<i>Bearbeiten</i>).     This also illustrates the perils of not leaving enough room for     expansion.     The English word <i>Edit</i> is just four letters long, but the German     word is ten letters long (and the Swedish one eight letters),     and the longer German and Swedish words get truncated. </li>
<li>The label <i>First name</i> was translated as <i>Första namn</i>.     <i>Första namn</i> does mean <i>first name</i>, but in      a literal sense, as in the sentence     “There are ten names. The first name is Wilson.”     The correct translation is <i>förnamn</i>, which means     <i>given name</i>     (in contrast to <i>efternamn</i>, or <i>family name</i>).     Similarly, the button <i>Forward</i> was translated as     <i>Vidare</i> (opposite of <i>backward</i>)     instead of <i>Vidarekoppla</i> (<i>to forward a phone call</i>). </li>
</ul>
<p> The first example above is just sloppiness, but the second one illustrates how a simple <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/29/2955171.aspx#2973687"> LocalizeString(“some text”)</a> algorithm doesn’t work. As Lance Fisher’s teacher put it, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/30/903348.aspx#903690">Russian is not a translation of English</a>.” You can’t just take words and phrases in one language and put them through a simple mapping table and expect the result to be accurate.</p>
<p> Back in the Windows 95 days, the German translation team needed some beta testers, and I volunteered. The most interesting translation bug I reported was one in which an English menu item <i>Sort</i> was translated as <i>Art</i> (which means <i>class, kind</i>) instead of <i>Anordnen</i> (which means <i>to arrange</i>). The one English word has two different meanings, and a blind dictionary translation won’t know which one is intended. </p>
