<p>There’s a new television show based on <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">The Department of Homeland Security</a>, titled <i><a href="http://www.dhs.tv/">D.H.S.</a></i>. I guess they realized that <i><a href="http://www.fox.com/oc/">The O.C.</a></i> was a hip edgy name so they’d try it too.
The audio clips I heard on the radio seemed to make the DHS sound like a non-stop adrenaline-rush guns-drawn kind of department, when my personal experience tells me it’s a bunch of color-coordinated, shoe-inspecting, nail-clipper-confiscating X-ray machine operators.</p>
<p>I think they should have more realistic episodes, consisting of security personnel doing typical everyday things like <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_873336.html">X-raying their own heads</a> or possibly getting upset when the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/display?theme=29">Terror Alert Level</a> changes color and they have to ditch their entire ensemble for the day and change into yellow, say. </p>
