<p> <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>‘s story about the <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/03/12/10/2050256.shtml">amateur         adventurer who is now stranded at McMurdo Base</a> (because he underestimated his         fuel requirements for a trip over the South Pole) reminded me of a controversy abrew         at the other end of the planet: <a href="http://www.ourhollowearth.com/PolarOpn.htm">The         hole at the North Pole</a>. To resolve this matter, <a href="http://www.voyagehollowearth.com/">Steve         Currey is mounting an expedition to the hole at the top of the earth</a>. Reserve         your seat now!  For only $20,000, you too can travel to the hole in the North         Pole and glory at the tropical landscape that awaits you. Maybe.      </p>
