<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Caption contest: The pinball machine</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
I may regret this, but here’s something new: A caption contest.
One of my colleagues saw this picture on a company’s Web site.
</p>
<img alt="Pinball machine with flipper about to strike ball." height="150" src="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/oldnewthing/WindowsLiveWriter/Draftfortesting_AA00/img30[2].jpg" width="180"/>
<p>
The original caption for this picture was something like
<i>Join our affiliate program</i>
or
<i>Score big with our affiliate program</i>.
Your mission is to come up with something funnier.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have balls of steel? Maybe you can become an affiliate.
<li>We love to flip off our affiliates.
<li>When you become an affiliate, you’re going to get whacked around a lot.
<li>Sooner or later you’ll end up in the hole.
<li>We like to play games with you. Become an affiliate today!
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Now it’s your turn.
Keep it friendly.
</p></p>
