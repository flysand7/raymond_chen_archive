<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">One way to make sure nobody sends you feedback</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year, somebody sent out a message to very large group of people describing a change to, well, what it described isn’t important to the story. What’s important is that the message ended with the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> If you have questions, please send them to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.commailto:abcdf">abcdef</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p> If you don’t see why this was a brilliant move, go back and check what that “abcdef” link really does.</p>
<p> One of my cynical colleagues noted, “Maybe this was intentional. That way, when they get no feedback, they can say, ‘See, this was an awesome decision. Nobody complained!'” </p>
