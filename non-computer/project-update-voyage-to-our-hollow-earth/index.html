<p> In December 2003, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/11/56058.aspx"> I reported on Steve Currey’s expedition to the hole at the top of the earth</a>, which <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031217204701/http://www.voyagehollowearth.com/"> at the time was scheduled for June 26, 2005</a>. But on May 6, 2004, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040506135516/http://www.voyagehollowearth.com/"> the site rescheduled the trip for Jun 26, 2006</a> with no explanation. The reservation form reminds you that the 25% deposit is non-refundable. </p>
<p> Far be it from me to suggest that these people are just stringing their loyal following along, pocketing the $4000 deposit, with no intention of actually mounting the expedition. That would be patently unfair of me. I’m certain there’s a perfectly reasonable and honorable explanation for the delay. </p>
