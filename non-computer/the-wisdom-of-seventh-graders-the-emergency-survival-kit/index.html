<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of seventh graders: The emergency survival kit</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As a precursor to reading a story about survival, seventh grade students were asked to come up with a list of things they would want to have in their emergency survival kit. Students were specifically instructed to limit themselves to things that were readily available (so no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH-64_Apache"> Apache helicopters</a>), and the complete kit had to be something you could comfortably carry in a student backpack.
 As always, there are students who chose a very sensible collection of things to put in their emergency survival kit: water purification tablets, a flashlight (with batteries), a first-aid kit. Those students are not the subject of today’s story.</p>
<p> Here are some of the more unusual items some students chose to put in their emergency survival kit: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fifty     <a href="http://www.babybites.info/2010/03/03/1-year-happy-meal/">     cheeseburgers</a>. </li>
<li>Moisturizer. </li>
<li>Colored pencils. </li>
<li>A puppy. </li>
<li>Fifty gallons of water. (Must be a strong kid with a really big backpack.) </li>
<li>A Gameboy. </li>
<li>Five     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuriken">     throwing stars</a>. </li>
<li>Jell-O. Because     <a href="http://www.jellogallery.org/">     there’s always room for Jell-O</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> September is <a href="http://www.ready.gov/"> National Preparedness Month</a>. </p>
