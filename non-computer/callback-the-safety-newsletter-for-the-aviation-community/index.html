<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Callback, the safety newsletter for the aviation community</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  Yes the “S” in  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>  stands for “Space”,  but don’t forget that the “A” stands for “Aeronautics”.  One of the programs that I (amateur aviation wannabe)  find fascinating is the  <a href="http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/">Aviation Safety  Reporting System</a>, where pilots can submit anonymous  reports of “stupid things I have done” in order to teach  other pilots “Don’t do what I did.”  </p>
<p> <a href="http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/callback.htm">  Back issues of their newsletter, Callback, are online</a>.  </p>
