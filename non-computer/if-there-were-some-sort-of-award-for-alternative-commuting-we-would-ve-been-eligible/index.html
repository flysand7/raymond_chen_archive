<p>A few projects ago, I worked on a team whose members came to work by a wide variety of modes. If there were some sort of award for alternative commuting, we would’ve been eligible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two bicyclists. </li>
<li>One runner. </li>
<li>One motorcyclist. </li>
<li>Two full-time telecommuters. </li>
<li>One part-time telecommuter. </li>
<li>One traditional car commuter. (Freak.) </li>
</ul>
<p> One of the full-time telecommuters was based in Spain, which was handy because he was available to deal with issues that cropped up while everybody in Redmond was sleeping. </p>
<p> Perhaps to compensate for all the gasoline being saved by his employees, our manager drove an oversized pick-up truck to work. </p>
