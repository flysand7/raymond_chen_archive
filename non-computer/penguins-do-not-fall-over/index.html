<p> Everyone has read the story about penguins  falling over backwards while observing low-flying aircraft. <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2004/09/do_penguins_top.html"> The Annals of Improbable Research reports</a> that Dr. Richard Stone has been <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/BAS_Science/Programmes/Independent/penguin_helos.html"> researching the ecological effects of helicopter overflights on King penguins</a> and his preliminary results show that <a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/News_and_Information/Stories/2000/penguin_disturbance.html"> King penguins do not, in fact, fall over backwards (or forwards or even sideways) when you fly over them</a>. On the other hand, low-flying aircraft do create distress among the penguins; Dr. Stone recommends a minimum overflight altitude of 1000 feet. </p>
