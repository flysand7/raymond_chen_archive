<p> (Note: This makes sense only after you’ve gone through the other puzzles.) </p>
<p> In case my friend got stuck, she could call me and ask for a hint. The original plan was that I would charge her a dare in order to get a hint, but it turns out I was too nice a guy to make her do any of the following things, but here’s the list anyway: </p>
<ul>
<li>Scream “I love you, Seattle!” at a street corner </li>
<li>Skip across the street </li>
<li>Walk sideways </li>
<li>Caress a lamppost </li>
<li>Dance </li>
<li>Sing the national anthem (any country) [typo fixed 7/6] </li>
<li>Ask for directions to where you are </li>
<li>Recite six lines from a favorite book or poem </li>
<li>Wave and shout hello to a traffic light </li>
</ul>
