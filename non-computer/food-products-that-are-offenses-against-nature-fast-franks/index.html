<p>My colleague (who posts under the pseudonym <a href="http://cloudystarlight.spaces.live.com/"> Cloudy Starlight</a>) <a href="http://cloudystarlight.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E9F7F433894A3F89!146.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&amp;_c=blogpart#permalink"> tipped me off</a> to some wonderful products which made me just stare at the screen agape, unable to express my, um, awe. I’ll focus on one of the products today; the others will have to wait for another day.
 First, let’s suppose you’ve got a hankerin’ for a hot dog. Your adventure might go like this:
 “Gotta have a hot dog, gotta have a hot dog. Where’s that hot dog? In the fridge. Right, in the fridge. Open the fridge, find the hot dog. Find the hot dog. Got it. Need a bun. Where’s the bun? <b>Where’s the bun!</b> <font size="+1"> <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/70/3354.html"> My kingdom for a bun</a>!</font> Oh, there’s the bun, «pant pant» ah, my bun, my precious. Okay, get a plate, need a plate. No, that one’s too big. No, that’s not microwave-safe. Okay, got a small microwave-safe plate. Put bun with hot dog on plate. Put plate in microwave oven. Punch in thirty seconds. Thirty seconds. Go. Oh wait, close door. Okay, go. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight. Isn’t there anything faster than a microwave?! Three. Two. One. DING! Yes! I have a hot dog! Put hot dog in bun. Ow, hot hot hot. Yes! Dog is in the bun! Let the hot dog-lisciousy goodness commence!”
 If that’s your experience with cooking a hot dog in a microwave, may I first recommend psychological treatment. You really need help.
 Second, <a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/oscarmayer/main.aspx?s=product&amp;m=product/product_display&amp;Site=1&amp;Product=4470000541"> Oscar Mayer Fast Franks</a> has been created just for you. Instead of that entire adventure with the bun and the plate, the good people at Kraft have <i>already put the hot dog in a bun</i> and even provided the plate! Thus you’ve saved an entire <i>four seconds</i> of hot dog preparation time. Added up over a year of a daily hot dog obsession, that comes out to nearly twenty-five minutes of your life wasted putting hot dogs in buns and putting them on plates. You could watch an entire episode of <i>Futurama</i> with time left over to replay the best jokes!
 Let’s take a look at their <a href="http://www.kraft.com/newsroom/OMRanks.html"> press release</a>. I reprint it here in its entire awesomeness:</p>

<p> That’s right, they use <i>proprietary dough technology</i>. This ain’t your grandfather’s hot dog bun, no siree. We had researchers toiling away day and night perfecting their dough technology to bring you this perfect specimen of a hot dog bun.
 And what’s with that whole Julie Roberts thing at the end? <a href="http://www.wxix.com/Global/story.asp?S=4849292"> What does that have to do with hot dogs</a>? And “A” isn’t a self-titled album. Her name isn’t “A”; it’s Julie Roberts!
 But that’s okay, because it’s a quick and yummy lunch <i>for the whole family</i>. Note that that’s a family of three people, since only three hot dogs come in a package. We’re talking mommy, daddy, and the kid who throws a tantrum unless he gets a microwave hot dog in thirty seconds.
 Wait a second, what did it say at the top? Thirty-<i>five</i> seconds? Not thirty seconds? My four-seconds savings gone down the tubes! Noooo! Don’t take away my <i>Futurama</i>!</p>
