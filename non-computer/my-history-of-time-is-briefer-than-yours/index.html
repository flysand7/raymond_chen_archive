<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My history of time is briefer than yours</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In 1999, Eric Schulman published <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/bhtes/reviews.html"> <i>A Briefer History of Time</i></a>, based upon his previous effort to <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/hist/hist.html"> capture the history of the universe in 200 words</a>. The book takes the initial 200-word summary and expands upon each phrase, surreptitiously teaching you some science among the jokes. (You can even <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.cfm?med_id=54447"> watch a video</a>.)</p>
<p> And then <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/"> this Hawking guy</a> shows up and gives his book <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0553804367"> the exact same title</a>. What a rip-off. </p>
<p> (I’m told this Hawking guy has a lot of fans. Those who live in the Seattle area might be interested to know that <a href="http://www.theparamount.com/artists/artist.asp?key=261"> he’ll be in town</a> in mid-November.) </p>
