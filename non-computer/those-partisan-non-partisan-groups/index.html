<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Those partisan non-partisan groups</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Just because they say they’re non-partisan doesn’t mean that they’re non-partisan.</p>
<p> Friday night, I got a phone call from “Victor” at “Washington Counts” who came right out and asked me whom I was going to vote for. </p>
<p> I asked him to repeat the name of the organization he represents, and he said, “Washington Counts, a non-partisan organization, working in cooperation with Emily’s List.” </p>
<p> I couldn’t find any information about “Washington Counts”, but I did find <a href="http://www.emilyslist.org/">Emily’s List</a>, which is a blatantly partisan group. Their own <a href="http://www.emilyslist.org/about/">About Page</a> say that they are “dedicated to… electing pro-choice Democratic women”. </p>
<p> I pointed out to “Victor” that Emily’s List is a partisan group.  He ignored me and repeated his question, asking me whom I was going to vote for. </p>
<p> I told him that I was unlikely to be inclined to assist an organization that start out by lying to me. </p>
<p> And then I heard a click and a recorded voice saying, “This survey was sponsored by Emily’s List. On the web at www.emilyslist.org.” </p>
<p> Let’s see what happened here.  Somebody claimed to be from “Washington Counts”, but in fact they were from “Emily’s List”. [Corrected identification 9:38am.] That person claimed to be representing a non-partisan group, but in fact the group is highly partisan. </p>
<p> I guess if you’re going to lie, you may as well go all-out. </p>
<p> Of course, this could have been a double-fake-out. Perhaps it was really a pro-life Republican group <strong>pretending</strong> to be a pro-choice Democratic group? </p>
<p> These sorts of double-fake-outs are not unheard of. In California, anybody who pays the requisite fee can get a statement printed in the voter’s guide. It has been known to occur that somebody who holds one position on an issue submits <strong>an incoherent or absurd statement in support of the opposition position</strong>, thereby making the opposition look stupid. During the 1996 U.S. presidential election primary season, Candidate X sponsored a telephone survey asking voters “If Candidate Y took &lt;controversial position&gt;, would your opinion of Candidate Y go up, down, or stay the same?” The intent here was to start the rumor that Candidate Y was actually considering taking said controversial position (which would have undermined Candidate Y’s traditional support). </p>
<p> You can never tell where the dirty tricks are coming from in politics. </p>
