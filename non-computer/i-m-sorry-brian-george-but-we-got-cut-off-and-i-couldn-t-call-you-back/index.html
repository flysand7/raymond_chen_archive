<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I’m sorry, Brian George, but we got cut off and I couldn’t call you back</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Yesterday, at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, I receive a telephone call at work. There is that characteristic pause after connecting which tells me that I have probably just been called by a telemarketer.</p>
<p> “Hello?” </p>
<p> — <i>Hello, I’m Brian George from Liquid Capital Management. Our company founder, Brian Kim, has been working closely with Microsoft employees to help them with financial matters. Are you familiar with hedge funds?</i> </p>
<p> I hear another voice in the background. This is almost certainly a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/boiler.htm"> boiler room</a> operation. </p>
<p> “There appears to be another voice on the line, do you hear it? Oh wait, it’s gone. Could you repeat the name of your company?” </p>
<p> — <i>It’s Liquid Capital. Are you the Chief Financial Officer?</i> </p>
<p> “Liquid Capital Corporation?” </p>
<p> — <i>No, Liquid Capital Management. Are you familiar with hedge funds?</i> </p>
<p> “And your company’s founder’s name, is that spelled with a Y or an I?” </p>
<p> — <i>With an I. Are you familiar with hedge funds?</i> </p>
<p> “I’m sorry, if you could just answer a few questions so I can log this call properly. You are Brian George from Liquid Capital Management. I assume your name is spelled with an I as well?” </p>
<p> — <i>Yes.</i> </p>
<p> “Excellent. And where is your company based?” </p>
<p> — <i>We’re in New York City.</i> </p>
<p> “Okay, and what is your phone number, in case we get disconnected?” </p>
<p> — <i>646-237-4400. Are you familiar with hedge funds?</i> </p>
<p> “Okay, thank you for your patience. Now, what was it you would like to talk about?” </p>
<p> (Silence.) </p>
<p> Apparently, Mr. George became impatient with my call logging procedure and hung up. I try calling him back, but an automated voice tells me, “We’re sorry. The party you have dialed is not accepting calls at this time.” </p>
<p> He was calling after business hours in New York, so maybe it was some sort of emergency. Gosh, I hope he wasn’t calling about anything important. </p>
