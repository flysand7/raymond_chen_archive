<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On the bogusness of reporting the winning word in a spelling bee</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Whenever the United States media report on a spelling bee (typically, the <a href="http://www.spellingbee.com/"> Scripps National Spelling Bee</a>, the best-known spelling bee in the country), they always report on the “<a href="http://www.spellingbee.com/bwg/statschamp.shtml">winning word</a>“. But the winning word is a bogus metric because the winning word in real life tends to be comparatively easy. It’s the <strong>penultimate</strong> word that is the hard one.
 In nearly all spelling bees, when the field narrows to just two contestants, if one contestant misses a word, the other contestant must spell that word <strong>plus</strong> a bonus word to win. Sort of like volleyball. The bonus word is not necessarily a hard word; in fact, just by the principle of regression to the mean, it is likely to be a comparatively easy word. The hard word is the one that knocked out the second-place winner. Look at it this way: Nobody misspelled the winning word, so how hard can it be?
 Consider this hypothetical spelling bee:
 <b>Judge</b>: The word is “chiaroscuro”.<br/> <b>Player A</b>: c-h-i-a-r-u-s-c-u-r-o.<br/> <b>Judge</b>: I’m sorry, that’s incorrect. Player B?<br/> <b>Player B</b>: c-h-i-a-r-o-s-c-u-r-o.<br/> <b>Judge</b>: Correct. And your next word is “dog”.<br/> <b>Player B</b>: d-o-g.<br/> <b>Judge</b>: Congratulations, Player B, you’re the winner.
 [9am: How embarrassing. I misspelled “chiaroscuro”.]
 The newspapers all report that “The winning word was ‘dog’,” and people reading the newspaper say, “Pshaw, I don’t know why people get all worked up about this spelling bee thing. Even I can spell ‘dog’.”
 For example, in 2005, the “winning word” was “appoggiatura”, a word any musician can spell in their sleep. The penultimate word was the somewhat more challenging “roscian”.</p>
<p> This year’s Scripps National Spelling Bee will be held on May 31 and June 1, 2006. </p>
