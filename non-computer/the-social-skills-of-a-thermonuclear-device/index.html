<p><a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2004/2/15/71552/7795?pid=79#88"> Somebody@somewhere.else described me as having the social skills of a thermonuclear device</a>. I don’t remember the incident in question, but I’ll have to accept that it happened.
 I have a very low tolerance for laziness. If you come to me for help, I expect you to have done your homework. (Though I try to scale my expectations to your position. If you’re in a coding position then you had better know how to use a debugger. If you’re in a testing position, then you had better know at least how to install the debugger. This is considered part of the standard skill set for a tester.)</p>
<p> But the absolute worst thing you can do is start a conversation by saying, “Hey, Raymond, since you know everything, can you do this for me…?” </p>
