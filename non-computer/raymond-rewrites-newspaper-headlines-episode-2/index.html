<p> The local community newspaper featured a color photograph of a twelve-year-old student holding a bright orange safety flag while another student crosses the street in front of him. The caption reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> XYZ School 6th-grader John Doe, at right, will be honored Friday night at Safeco Field as one of the state’s top safety patrol students. </p></blockquote>
<p> “On Monday morning, he will be found stuffed inside his locker,” the caption did not conclude. </p>
