<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and France?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Recently-unearthed documents reveal that back in the 1950’s, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6859736"> France proposed merging with United Kingdom into a single country</a> or at least joining the <a href="http://www.commonwealth-of-nations.org/article.php"> Commonwealth</a>. Apparently, Churchill proposed a similar alliance in the 1940. It too was rejected. (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003526582_frangland16.html">Other coverage</a>. There’s a secret joke in that article: Check out the URL.)
 Apparently, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6888941"> the proposal was never seriously considered</a>.</p>
<p> Ah, what could have been… </p>
