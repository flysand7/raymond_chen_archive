<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/21/8880076.aspx"> I was in San Francisco this weekend</a> for a wedding. The flower girl was the bride’s two-year-old niece, and when you add a two-year-old to the wedding party, you never know what’s going to happen, because two-year-olds don’t understand the world the same way adults do.</p>
<p> During the <a href="http://www.loveisanexplodingcigar.com/shirleyjump/wedding_disasters_and_funnies"> unity candle ceremony</a>, the two-year-old pushed her way to the table, joining the bride and groom, in order to get a front-row seat for the ritual. And then when the unity candle was lit, she tried to blow it out. </p>
<p> Because when you’re two years old, the only time you see people make a big deal about lighting a candle is when it’s atop a birthday cake, and you know what to do with birthday candles! </p>
