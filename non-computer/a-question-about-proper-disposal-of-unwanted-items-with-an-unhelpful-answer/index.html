<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A question about proper disposal of unwanted items with an unhelpful answer</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> On an internal mailing list about home maintenance and ownership, somebody asked: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> I have a handful of items that I need to get rid of and probably should not toss into the regular garbage. Any thoughts? </p>
<ul>
<li>Older TV — 32″ </li>
<li>Propane tanks (full) </li>
<li>Lighter fluid </li>
<li>Carpet glue adhesive </li>
<li>Lawn fertilizer </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> The best reply was an unhelpful one. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> You’ve pretty much got all the components you need to build a bomb. Why dispose of them? </p>
