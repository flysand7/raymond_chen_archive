<p>According to <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/">Aftonbladet</a>, “Gathering Stockholm’s finest news from overheard conversations on the street corner”, <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/nyheter/story/0,2789,409310,00.html">En av fem stjäl sin julgran</a>. (“One in five steals their Christmas tree.”) This of course comes from a highly scientific <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/special/storfragan/visa/0,1937,10725,00.html">online reader poll</a>. The question is, “How do you get your Christmas tree?” and the response categories are (from top to bottom, with percentages as of 2:31pm PST): “Buy” (35.7%), “Cut with permission” (13.2%), “Cut without permission” (14.3%), “Steal from some other source” (6.1%), “Get from some other source” (4.1%) and “Don’t have a tree” (26.7%).</p>
