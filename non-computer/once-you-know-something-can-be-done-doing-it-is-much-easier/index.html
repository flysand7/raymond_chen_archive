<p>Unfortunately, I don’t remember the name of the star of this story, but I’m told that there was a notable mathematician who believed the <i>Perfect Graph Conjecture</i> to be false and spent many years trying to prove it one way or another.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, another mathematician (presumably László Lovász) announced that he had found a proof (in the affirmative). </p>
<p> Upon hearing the news that the open question had been resolved, the first mathematician was able to produce a proof within 90 minutes. </p>
<p> Once again showing that it’s much easier to do something once you know it can be done. </p>
