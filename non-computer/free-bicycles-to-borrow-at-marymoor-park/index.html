<p><a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/rentals/pomjun99.htm"> Marymoor Park</a> just keeps getting better.</p>
<p> Just this year, they added <a href="http://dnr.metrokc.gov/dnrp/press/2005/0512Subwayrelease.htm"> a little Subway sandwich shop</a>, so you don’t even have to pack for a picnic in the park. Next, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/eastsidenews/2002354251_marymoor01e.html"> free Wi-Fi</a> (sponsored by <a href="http://www.msn.com/">MSN</a>). Then <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002417668_movies03e.html"> movies in the park</a> (sponsored by <a href="http://www.firsttechcu.com/">First Tech Credit Union</a>). </p>
<p> The latest addition is <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/traveloutdoors/2002450709_nwwfastbreak25.html"> free bicycles</a> (sponsored by <a href="http://www.dasani.com/">Dasani</a>). Show a photo ID and you get a cardkey that gives you access to one-speed coaster-brake bicycles you can borrow for the day. </p>
