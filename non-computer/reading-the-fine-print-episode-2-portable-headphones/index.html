<p>Marketing writes the big print; lawyers write the small print.
 I bought some portable stereo headphones.  The front of the box says you can use it “while in-line skating, power walking, <em>biking</em>, jogging, skiing, running, weightlifting, climbing and more.” (Emphasis mine.)
 The back of the box says that it should not be used “while driving or <em>cycling</em>.”</p>
