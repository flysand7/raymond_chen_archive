<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A Few Seconds of Panic: Life as an NFL kicker</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Although I don’t follow him regularly when he appears on <i>All Things Considered</i> and didn’t when he wrote for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, I’m a quiet fan of Stefan Fatsis’s books because he writes about joining a world most of us don’t get to see. I previously wrote about his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/14/113053.aspx"> excursion into the world of competitive Scrabble</a>. Today, it’s his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594201781?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>A Few Seconds of Panic</i></a>, or more formally, <i>A Few Seconds of Panic: A 5-Foot-8, 170-Pound, 43-Year-Old Sportswriter Plays in the NFL</i>, another example of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/03/5249867.aspx"> <i>Catchy title: Long boring subtitle</i></a> book title fad. [Update: Now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143115472?tag=tholneth-20"> available in paperback</a>.] Fatsis convinces a professional football team to let him join them for a pre-season game as a place kicker. From there, he observes the working of an NFL team from the inside. NPR’s <i>Only a Game</i> interviewed him in August 2008. [<a href="http://www.bu.edu/wbur/storage/2008/08/onlyagame_0823_7.mp3">mp3</a>]
 (Fatsis is a regular member of Slate’s new weekly sports podcast <a href="http://www.slate.com/rss/feed.aspx?id=2224225"> <i>Hang Up and Listen</i></a>. He mentions his kicking career only every other podcast now.)</p>
<p> (And I wasted far too much time on what is rumored to be another Stefan Fatsis production, <a href="http://nameoftheyear.blogspot.com/"> <i>Name of the Year</i></a>. Here’s a list of <a href="http://nameoftheyear.blogspot.com/2007/02/year-by-year-noty-winners.html"> previous winners</a>.) </p>
