<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The coolest thing you can do with a Gameboy is not "play a game on it"</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  From  Public Radio International,  <i><a href="http://www.nextbigthing.org/">The Next Big Thing</a></i>  covers  <a href="http://www.glomag.com/gameboymatch/">The Gameboy Music Match</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>  These days, a lot of electronic music is performed directly  off of a laptop, which most people complain looks a lot like  someone up there on stage checking their email.  But Gameboy music isn’t just for listening.  It’s also a performance.  <a href="http://www.nullsleep.com/">  Nullsleep</a> plays with both thumbs   tapping, both feet moving, and head swaying.  Okay, yeah, it looks like he’s playing a video game.  But a <strong>really great</strong>  video game.  </p></blockquote>
