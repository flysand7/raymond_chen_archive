<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploding frying pans</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year there was  <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4944764.htm">  a recall of exploding frying pans</a>.  For some reason I found this funny.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  “The pans can explode or separate when preheated,  used on high heat or <strong>used for frying</strong>,”  the safety commission said in a statement.  </p></blockquote>
<p>  It <strong>explodes</strong> when you  <strong>fry something in it</strong>.</p>
<p>  Apparently “frying stuff” was not in the test plan for the frying pans.  </p>
