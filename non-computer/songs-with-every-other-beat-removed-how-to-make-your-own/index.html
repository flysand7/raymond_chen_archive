<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Songs with every other beat removed, how to make your own!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBqq7XaLzxIxu17CJ-7QCNw">EveryOtherBeat</a> takes popular songs and removes every other beat. So does the Tumblr <a href="https://spudislander.tumblr.com/tagged/everysecondbeat">EverySecondBeat</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://infinitejukebox.playlistmachinery.com/"> The Infinite Jukebox</a>. The original purpose of this site is to make a song infinitely long by finding sections that are self-similar and using them to splice the song into an infinite loop. But we’ll use its feature to remove every other beat.</li>
<li>Pick a song you would like to transform.</li>
<li>Click the <i>Tune</i> button.</li>
<li>Set the <i>Branch Similarity Threshold</i> to the minimum, and uncheck <i>Loop extension optimization</i>. These operations create a straight path through the song with no looping.</li>
<li>Hit the right-arrow key once. This sets the play velocity to 2x, which removes every other beat. (More keyboard shortcuts can be found under the FAQ link.)</li>
<li>Click <i>Play</i> and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
