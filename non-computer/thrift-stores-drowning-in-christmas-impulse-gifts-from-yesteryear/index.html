<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Thrift stores drowning in Christmas impulse gifts from yesteryear</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Last year, the <i>Washington Post</i> covered <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102298.html"> the fates of The Thing</a>, that Christmas impulse gift that stores place in enticing locations in the store to convince you that you simply gotta have it. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DE2SS?tag=tholneth-20"> twirling apple peeler</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000A2LS2C?tag=tholneth-20"> liquor carousel</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HGKQUQ?tag=tholneth-20"> portable chocolate fountain</a> (for your <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/25/8770549.aspx"> fancy party</a>, no doubt). </p>
<p> After a few years, some of them show up by the garbage-bagful at the Opportunity Shop thrift store. “We get three or four fondue sets a month… Sometimes we get stuff and I don’t even know what the stuff is.” </p>
