<p> In my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/30/10181646.aspx"> 2011 mid-year link clearance</a>, I linked to the story <a href="http://thebloggess.com/2011/06/and-thats-why-you-should-learn-to-pick-your-battles/"> <i>And that’s why you should learn to pick your battles</i></a>. I thought that was the end of the story, but no, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. Beyoncé, the giant metal chicken <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Beyonce-the-giant-metal-chicken/245571305466603?filter=1"> has a Facebook page</a>, populated with all sorts of crazy things like pictures of Beyoncé’s relatives spotted in the wild (some of them knocking on doors or peeking in windows), a <i>No Soliciting</i> sign just for giant metal chickens, and an updated version of the chart of anniversary gifts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wedding_anniversary&amp;oldid=436229039#Traditional_and_modern_anniversary_gifts"> which lists BIG METAL CHICKEN as the modern 15th anniversary present</a>.</p>
