<p>In Lisbon, walk/don’t walk signs are mostly decorative. The real rule for crossing the street is <i>look both ways and cross when safe</i>. There’s no requirement that you use a designated crosswalk. As long as the coast is clear, you can cross the street anywhere. When my host for <a href="http://sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/"> the conference</a> accompanied me to the conference center, we crossed the street and my host pointed out, “You know, we’re actually using the official crosswalk this time.”
 I was talking with one of the faculty members of the <a href="http://www.dei.ist.utl.pt/"> computer science department at IST</a> and mentioned that in Seattle, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/118788_jaywalk23.html"> the police issue tickets for crossing the street incorrectly</a>. The faculty member responded, “In Portugal, there is no such thing as crossing the street incorrectly.”</p>
<p> (For what it’s worth, people in Madrid restrict themselves to crossing at crosswalks and generally observe the walk/don’t walk signs, although if the light says <i>don’t walk</i> and there are no cars anywhere nearby, they will cross anyway. This evaluation of Madrid crosswalk behavior is probably skewed by the higher concentration of tourists.) </p>
