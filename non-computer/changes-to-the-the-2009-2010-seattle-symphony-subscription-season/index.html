<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Changes to the the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A thank-you to commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx#9399628">Greg</a> for pointing it out that the Seattle Symphony made changes to their UBS Masterworks 13 series after the brochures were printed. I compared my printed brochure against <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/_dwn/0910_Main%20Season.pdf"> the online one</a> and updated <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx"> the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance</a> accordingly. They deleted five concerts and added six, so the Masterworks 13 series actually has 14 concerts. They probably kept the name for backward compatibility.</p>
