<p> <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,278018,00.html">Wenn Teenies         shoppen gehen: Flugzeuge im Warenkorb</a>. This article caught my eye because it opens         with a German slang phrase I learned just a few weeks ago: “Tote Hose” which means         roughly “Absolutely nothing doing”. Here’s <a href="http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/international.cfm?id=1367022003">an         English version of the article</a> for those whose German isn’t quite up to snuff.      </p>
<p>     A question for Germans: Since when did “shoppen” become a German word? What happened     to “einkaufen”? Do people prefer the English words because they sound “cooler”?  </p>
