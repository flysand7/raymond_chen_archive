<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It is not illegal to use James Bond style tactics for winning at the roulette wheel</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/40874"> an operation straight out of a James Bond movie, a trio of gamblers used a laser range-finder hidden in a mobile phone to predict the likeliest landing spot of a roulette ball</a>, reducing the odds from 37-1 to 6-1.</p>
<p> Scotland Yard concluded that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1367094,00.html"> they did nothing illegal</a> and were allowed to keep their winnings. </p>
<p> I wonder how long it’ll be before this device shows up on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>. </p>
<p> (Once I discovered that <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/05/168240"> I was scooped by Slashdot</a>, I figured there was no hurry and held the story for a quiet day.) </p>
