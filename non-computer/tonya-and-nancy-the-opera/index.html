<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Tonya and Nancy: The Opera</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> No, really, it’s not a joke. <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/shows/2006/05/20060506_14.asp"> There really is an opera written about Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan</a>. And <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/"><i>Only a Game</i></a> is there. </p>
<p> The work was composed as a master’s thesis at Tufts University by Abigail Al-Doory and, as is the nature of said productions, it was performed exactly twice and then packed away. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> <b>Abigail Al-Doory</b>: We’ve got our opening scene with the first press conference since the knee-whacking. Tonya and Nancy meet for the first time. Then we go into a flashback which shows the knee-whacking. </p>
<p> <b>Bill Littlefield</b>: Knee-whacking as opera. This is irresistable. </p>
<p> <b>Abigail Al-Doory</b>: It’s incredible to me. I mean, I wrote it, and every time I watch it… </p>
<p> <b>Bill Littlefield</b>: [interrupting, singing] “Oh ho ho ho! I whack your knee!” Something like that? </p>
<p> <b>Abigail Al-Doory</b>: Not exactly.  </p></blockquote>
