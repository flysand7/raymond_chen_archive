<p> Alas, the original plan for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/18/760790.aspx"> the trip to the hole in the Arctic Ocean</a> had to be scrapped due to the passing of organizer Steven Currey. But hollow earthers, don’t give up hope! <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=d4dc1dde-710a-4b18-bc3e-cc72fd83aad9&amp;k=77359"> U.S. scientist Brooks Agnew has announced his plans</a> to take the place of Mr. Currey, chartering the same ship and taking the same itinerary with the same goal. </p>
<p> We’ll check in next year to see what they’ve found. </p>
