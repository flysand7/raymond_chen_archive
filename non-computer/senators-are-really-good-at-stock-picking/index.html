<blockquote class="q"><p>  A Georgia State University study shows that  <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1751162">  U.S. senators have an uncanny knack for picking stocks that  outpace the overall market</a>.  Professor Alan Ziobrowski’s analysis of senators’ financial disclosure  data found that over a period of six years,  the lawmakers outperformed the market by 12 percent.   </p>
<p>  Professor Ziobrowski seems convinced that this is evidence of  unethical behavior.  </p>
