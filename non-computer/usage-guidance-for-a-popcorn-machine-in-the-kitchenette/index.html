<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Usage guidance for a popcorn machine in the kitchenette</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My colleague <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/">KC Lemson</a> tipped me off to a sign hanging next to a popcorn machine in one of the kitchens:</p>
<table style="border: solid black .75pt; margin-left: 2em;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 1ex;">
<p>Please <b>do not leave<br/>
popcorn kettle on</b><br/>
while unattended.<br/>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/02/26/9969665.aspx#9970021"> The fire truck will<br/>
come</a>, and they don’t<br/>
want any popcorn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-size: 30pt;">🚒</p>

<p>A friend of mine happened to have a chat with a fire fighter who used to be assigned to the fire station nearest to Microsoft main campus. According to him, the top three reasons for being called to a Microsoft building are (in no particular order)</p>
<ul>
<li>Burnt popcorn.</li>
<li>Somebody has a panic attack and mistakes it for a heart attack.</li>
<li>Somebody pulls the fire alarm because they are under a lot of stress because they missed a deadline, and they think pulling the fire alarm will buy them some time. (Where do they think they are, college?)</li>
</ul>
