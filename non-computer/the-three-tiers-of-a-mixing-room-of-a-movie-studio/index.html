<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The three tiers of a mixing room of a movie studio</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://snippy.livejournal.com/"> Kai Jones</a> describes <a href="http://snippy.livejournal.com/306890.html"> what you see in the mixing room of a movie studio</a>. It’s very simple but very telling. I won’t give away the punch line; go read it yourself. (It’s the paragraph that begins, “We also went into the sound building.”) </p>
