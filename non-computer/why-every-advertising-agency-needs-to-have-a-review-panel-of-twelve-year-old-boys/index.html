<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why every advertising agency needs to have a review panel of twelve-year-old boys</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Office of Government and Commerce needed a new logo, and they hired a design firm to develop one for £14,000. The conversations between the design company and their client may have gone something like this:</p>
<p>Designer: Okay, so here are some ideas we came up with.</p>
<p>Client: I don’t like any of them. The lines are too thick. I want something lighter, more friendly and less bureaucratic.</p>
<p>Second meeting.</p>
<p>Designer: Here are some variations that use thinner lines.</p>
<p>Client: Nope, these are all still ugly. Give me something with more circles. Less angular.</p>
<p>Third meeting.</p>
<p>Designer: We came up with some variations on your circle idea.</p>
<p>Client: No, we can’t use these. They have colour in them. A coloured logo would make our letterhead much more expensive.</p>
<p>And so on. Finally, the design team comes up with something the client approves of. Now it’s time to order the mousepads and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501042135/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1901656/OGC-unveils-new-logo-to-red-faces.html"> unveil the logo</a>.</p>
