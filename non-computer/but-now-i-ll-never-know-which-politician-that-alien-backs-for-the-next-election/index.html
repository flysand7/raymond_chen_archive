<p>It has been reported that everybody’s favorite mock tabloid <a href="http://newsbloggers.aol.com/2007/07/24/instapollamericanow-mourning-the-weekly-world-news/?ncid=NWS00010000000001"> <i>The Weekly World News</i> is ceasing publication</a>. Seeing as this is <i>The Weekly World News</i> we’re talking about, I’m not sure <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/newspapers/weekly_world_news_killed_by_aliens_declining_circulation_63587.asp"> how much of this I’m going to believe</a>, but people seem to be taking it at face value.
 I remember seeing a WWN article clipped out and posted on the door to a geology professor’s office at XYZ college. The article’s title was something like “Dinosaurs alive and well—on the moon!”* It was illustrated with a drawing of happy dinosaurs wandering around a tropical lunar paradise, and the article quoted “An XYZ geology professor” as having seen the dinosaurs through a telescope. (What’s a geologist doing looking at the moon through a telescope?) This was a small college, so the professor figured he must have been the one.
 <b>Nitpicker’s corner</b></p>
<p> *This story is from memory. I may have gotten details wrong. For example, the dinosaurs may have been on Mars, not the moon. The name of the college was probably not XYZ. </p>
