<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Thanks for coming together to enjoy the holiday together, now get off my lawn</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Due to a confluence of circumstances involving parents on an overseas vacation and other older relatives choosing not to attend (probably related to parents being out of town), I ended up being the oldest person at the extended family holiday dinner table.
 This was a first for me, and I resisted the urge to shout “Get off my lawn!” to the assembled masses or to bore younger relatives with rambling pointless stories from my youth.</p>
<p> I guess this is the converse to a friend of mine who presided over a holiday family gathering at his house some years ago, and who realized that if seating at the dinner table were done strictly by age, he would have to sit at the children’s table. </p>
