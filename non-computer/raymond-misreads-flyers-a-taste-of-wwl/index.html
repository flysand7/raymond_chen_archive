<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond misreads flyers: A Taste of WWL</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There were flyers in our building inviting people to attend a food event called <i>A Taste of WWL</i>.</p>
<p> The letters WWL stand for <i>Windows and Windows Live</i>, but the font they chose for the sign was confusing to me. The capital L looked like a capital I, and I misread the poster as an invitation to attend <i>A Taste of WWI</i>. </p>
<p> And then I thought, “Who the heck thought World War I was a fun event we’d want to re-experience?” </p>
<p> One of my colleagues, who also misread the poster, had a much more succinct response: “<a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/mmmm.html">Mmmm</a>… mustard gas…” </p>
