<p>When friends of mine were expecting their first child, the wife frequently received comments like “That’s okay. You’re <a href="http://www.english-at-home.com/idioms/food-idioms/"> eating for two</a> now.”
 The husband had a response ready:</p>
<p> “If she’s eating for two, I’m drinking for three!” </p>
