<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Throwing things into a blender and seeing what happens</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Manufacturer of commercial and home blenders Blendtec has produced a marketing web site <a href="http://www.willitblend.com/"> Will It Blend?</a> which features short videos of the company’s CEO and new <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650206639,00.html"> Internet blending icon</a> Tom Dickson throwing all sorts of unusual objects into one of their blenders, to see what happens. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=Blendtec">The videos are also on YouTube</a>, and of course they have a blog, cleverly titled <a href="http://www.willitblend.com/blog/"> Will it Blog?</a>) </p>
<p> There’s <a href="http://www.utahbusiness.com/parser.php?nav=article&amp;article_id=2346"> a miniature profile of Tom Dickson</a> in <i>Utah Business Magazine</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When Jamba Juice told Dickson the $14,000 blender package was too expensive, he cut them a deal, asking simply for a nickel of every sale. Now, with 50 million smoothies sold each year, Dickson says it was one of the best deals he ever made. </p></blockquote>
<p> “Will It Blend?” is sort of a blender-themed entry in the style of David Letterman’s crowd-pleasing stunts such as “Throwing things off the roof,” “Crushing things in a pneumatic press,” and <a href="http://www.ddy.com/dl21.html"> “Will it Float?</a>” (I suspect that only guys find this stuff fascinating.) </p>
