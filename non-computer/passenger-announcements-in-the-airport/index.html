<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Passenger announcements in the airport</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>While in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport yesterday, waiting for my flight to eventually be cancelled due to weather, then waiting for a replacement itinerary (um, the weather is the same at the destination; doesn’t matter which plane you take), then waiting for the replacement to be cancelled also (wow imagine that), I heard an announcement on the public address system: “Will passenger <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/opinion/columns/kinsleymichael/"> Michael Kinsley</a> please pick up a white courtesy phone.”
 Probably the closest I will get to Michael Kinsley.</p>
<p> Last year, while waiting in I think it was LAX or possibly DEN, I heard the announcement “Will passenger <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressroom/html/?ellisonl.html"> Larry Ellison</a> please pick up a white courtesy phone.” </p>
