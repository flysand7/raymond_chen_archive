<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nobody said it was a democracy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s proxy season, which means I’ve been reading through  proxy statement after proxy statement.
  <a href="http://www.allstate.com/investor/proxy/2002/2002proxy.html#toc_de1431_1">  The proxy voting rules for Allstate aren’t very democratic</a>.  Scroll down to “How votes are counted and discretionary voting  authority”:</p>
<blockquote class="LeftBorderLine"><p>  The thirteen nominees who receive the most votes  will be elected to the open directorships  even if they get less than a majority of the votes.  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Okay, let’s see, how many nominees are there?  Oh, exactly thirteen.
  How convenient.
  In other words: These thirteen people will be elected to directorships  regardless of what you do.
  So of course I voted against all of them.
  Later, I realized that I had fallen into their trap.
  You see, the only way I could stop these people from becoming  directors was to <strong>withhold my vote and attempt to hinder  a quorum</strong>.  Under these rules, a “no” vote is as good as a “yes” vote!</p>
<p>  Allstate isn’t the only company to rig their elections.  <a href="http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/investor_information/annual_report/">Baxter</a> and  <a href="http://www.wyeth.com/">Wyeth</a>  (can’t find proxy online)  have similarly sham elections.  </p>
