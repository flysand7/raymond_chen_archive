<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Crazy or cell phone?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You’ve seen it, I’m sure. People walking down the street talking to themselves. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/22/AR2006072200825.html"> Crazy or cellphone</a>?</p>
<p> What really gets me are the people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/18/8875652.aspx"> wear the headsets even when they aren’t talking on the telephone</a>, but rather in <strong>anticipation</strong> of receiving a telephone call. To those people, I have this to say to you: </p>
<p> You’re not that important. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28039226?pg=3#Tech_JerkGadgets"> Get over yourself</a>. </p>
<p> I remember a few years ago, I was in Los Angeles attending a little party and got a ride home from somebody who was heading my way. We got in the car, and she put on her headset before putting the car in gear. It was a half-hour drive. No telephone call. </p>
