<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It's official, it's the Hannukah Eve Storm of 2006</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>(Following up on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/26/1365216.aspx"> an earlier entry</a>.) The National Weather Service <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003598739_stormwinner03m.html"> chose a name for the wind storm of December 2006</a>: It’s going to be called the “Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm of 2006”.
 But what is Hannukah Eve? Eh, it doesn’t look like anybody’s getting too worked up over that.</p>
