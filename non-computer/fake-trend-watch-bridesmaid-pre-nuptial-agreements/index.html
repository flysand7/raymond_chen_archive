<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Fake trend watch: Bridesmaid pre-nuptial agreements</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My wanderings through the online world of bridesmaid craziness began with the article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/fashion/24skin.html"> <i>Brides taking their bridesmaids for Botox treatments or maybe a boob job</i></a>. I blame the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080503060241/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2007/05/21/mead_weddings/"> wedding-industrial complex</a>, which constantly pushes weddings as the bride’s “perfect day”, “the best day of your life”, a “fairy tale come true” where you can be “a princess for a day.” (Folk tales which end in big lavish weddings are told from the female point of view; there aren’t many folk tales about the young boy who grows up to marry a beautiful princess.)</p>
<p>And I love Elizabeth A.’s comment called out in the sidebar to the <i>New York Times</i> article.</p>
<p>Back to that article: Is the Botox girl’s night out a real trend or a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2086925"> fake trend</a>? In <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2008/02/pre-nups-for-br.html"> <i>Pre-nups for bridesmaids. Gain weight and you’re out</i></a>, the author claims that “one in five women actually ask their bridesmaids to sign a pre-nup.” On that, I call fake trend.</p>
<p>First of all, I could find only one actual documented case of a bride who made her bridesmaids sign contracts agreeing not to gain weight before the wedding. And <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3217531"> it was a prank</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, so if it happened only once, where did this “one in five” come from? I followed the citation to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-512107/One-brides-ask-bridesmaids-sign-pre-nup--sack-refused.html"> the source article in <i>The Daily Mail</i></a>, which merely says that one in five <i>would</i> ask their bridesmaids to sign such an agreement, not that one in five <i>actually did it</i>.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. I followed the citation from that <i>Daily Mail</i> article to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080802232311/http://www.youandyourwedding.co.uk/index.php/v1/Bridesmaid_contract"> the original survey from <i>You &amp; Your Wedding</i> magazine</a>, and found that it was even weaker than <i>The Daily Mail</i> described it: The actual result was that one in five <i>would consider a bridesmaid contract in general</i>. So we’re double-counterfactual now. And the survey was not scientific; it was just an online survey.</p>
<p>Okay, so let’s tally up the numbers. The claim that one in five brides ask their bridesmaids to sign a pre-nuptial agreement which includes a clause regarding weight would be true if…</p>
<ul>
<li>The online survey results were representative of brides as a whole (and the people who answered the survey were answering seriously), and</li>
<li>Everyone who <i>would</i> consider having a bridesmaid pre-nup actually <i>did</i> consider it, and</li>
<li>Everyone who considered it followed through and did it, and</li>
<li>Every one of those pre-nups contained a clause regarding weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>I call fake trend.</p>
