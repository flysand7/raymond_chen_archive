<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you know Swedish, the world is funnier</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As I was driving through Seattle the other day, I saw a sign for a personal storage company called “Stor-More”.
 I then had to laugh because in Swedish, “Stor-Mor” means “Big Momma”.
 It’s not restricted to Swedish. On my trip to Germany last year, my travelling companions found several German signs amusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Ausfahrt” (“highway exit”) </li>
<li>“Schmuck” (“jewelry”) </li>
<li>“Bad Kissing” (a town’s name; more accurately, “Bad Kissingen”,     but never let the truth get in the way of a good joke.  “Bad”     in German means “bath” or “spa”) </li>
</ul>
<p> When he told some German colleagues about this hilarious town name, they just looked at him as if to say, “What about Bad Kissingen? It’s a nice town. What’s so funny about it?” Only when he suggested that they look at it in English did they see the joke.</p>
<p> For some reason I love multilingual jokes. </p>
