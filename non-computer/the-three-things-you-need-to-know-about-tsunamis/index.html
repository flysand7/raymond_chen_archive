<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The three things you need to know about tsunamis</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One of my friends is involved with <a href="http://scienceontap.org/"> Science on Tap</a>, a free, informal monthly get-together in the Seattle area covering science topics for the general public. (<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/316495_ontap21.html">Recent coverage in the Seattle-PI</a>.) The topic for July 30th is “The three things you need to know about tsunamis”, and a title like that pretty much sells itself.</p>
