<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Joshua Roman groupies may have to set up their frequent flyer accounts</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Cellist Joshua Roman has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/11/2079141.aspx"> quite a dedicated following here in Seattle</a>, but those Joshua Roman groupies may have to dust off their frequent flyer cards, because the young cellist is <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2004154757_roman31.html"> resigning his position at the end of the season in order to pursue a solo career</a>.
 There has been quite a bit of turmoil at the Seattle Symphony in recent years. The former concertmaster <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/220097_ssoconcertmaster.html"> was forced out</a>, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/224521_talvi17.html"> leaving bitter feelings behind</a>, and <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002213706_concertmaster20.html"> the long search for a replacement</a> concluded with not one, not two, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2003900131_concertmaster25.html"> four permanent concertmasters</a> who will divide the leadership duties among themselves. A lawsuit filed by a violinist claiming “<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/263313_orch17.html">intentional emotional distress arising out of the hostile environment and harassment … over a long and extended period of time</a>” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/arts/music/16waki.html"> tickled the interest of <i>The New York Times</i></a> in late 2007 (and generated a number of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/arts/30letters.html"> letters to the editor in response</a>), although for us locals, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003305424_symphonyproblems15.html"> it’s old news</a>. (<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004145991_websymphony26.html">The lawsuit was dismissed</a> in early 2008.)</p>
<p> Makes you wonder how they find time to play music. </p>
