<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">"Friends" is so trendsetting</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The characters on the television program “Friends”  are apparently  <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1022916.htm">  trendsetters in the use of the word “so”</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  [People with way too much time on their hands]  spent a year going through transcripts  from each episode of the first eight seasons of <i>Friends</i>,  taking note of every single adjective…    [T]he show’s popularity peaked  at the same time the characters said “so” the most,  and as the use of the word declined, so did the show’s popularity.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  So that’s how to rescue the show: Make people say “so” more.
  So if I use the word “so” more, maybe that’ll increase my  popularity.  Yes, it’s so shallow of me, but so what?
  Grammar nitpick: “so” in the phrase “so cool” is an adverb,  not an adjective.</p>
<p>  Raymond’s brush with fame: I actually know  one of the writers on “Friends”.  </p>
