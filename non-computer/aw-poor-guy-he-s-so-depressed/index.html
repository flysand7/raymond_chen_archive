<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Aw, poor guy, he's so depressed</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I suspect Tanzi isn’t going to get much sympathy from, well, anybody. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b><a href="http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2004/mft04011521.htm"> Parmalat’s Tanzi is “Depressed”</a></b> </p>
<p> Lawyers for Calisto Tanzi, the jailed head of now-bankrupt European food and dairy group <a href="http://www.parmalat.com/">Parmalat</a>, claim that he is “depressed” in prison, constantly asking about his family. The lawyers have suggested that Tanzi be released from prison and placed under house arrest. Apparently, Tanzi was well enough in the last few weeks to travel to Ecuador, but the stress of prison is simply too much. </p>
