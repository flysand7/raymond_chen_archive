<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Ein hundert Dinge, die in den Vereinigten Staaten besser bleiben</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I think it is a trait common to many people that they are fascinated by how their country is viewed by others. The leftist <i><a href="http://www.taz.de/">Die Tageszeitung</a></i> from Germany <a href="http://www.taz.de/pt/2004/11/03.nf/ressort.q,TAZ.re,sw#a0146"> reacted to the result of the most recent U.S. presidential election</a> with their list of <a href="http://www.taz.de/pt/2004/11/03/a0146.nf/text"> one hundred things that are still better in the United States</a>. </p>
<p> Those who cannot read German can use <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/36763"> a translation provided by a Metafilter reader</a> (which is where I found this article, if you haven’t figured it out). But of course it’s better to read something in its original language if you can. </p>
