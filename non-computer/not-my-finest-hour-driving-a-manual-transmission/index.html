<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/"> Sara Ford</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2007/05/24/not-broken-after-all.aspx"> messed up her leg</a> last month; you can see her on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy/archive/2007/06/07/Sara-Ford-commands-ScooterCam_2D00_1-at-TechEd07.aspx"> ScooterCam-1</a> at TechEd 2007. The best part of the name ScooterCam-1 isn’t the ScooterCam; it’s the 1. That just gives it that extra little kitchy space technology feel that turns a good name into a great name.
 Anyway, she asked around if somebody with a car with an automatic transmission would be willing to swap with her manual transmission car until her leg got better. To me, driving a stick shift is like changing a flat tire: It’s something that everybody should know how to do, but it’s not something that anybody is expected to enjoy doing. I offered my car and (long boring part of story deleted) we met at her place and exchanged keys. I got into her car, backed out of the parking space, and… stalled right in front of her.</p>
<p> Great job there. I really know how to instill confidence. </p>
