<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Who you calling boring?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A notice was sent out by the real estate department with the provocative subject line <i>Campus notification — <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/01/8346907.aspx"> Building 7</a>: Marking Boring Locations</i>.</p>
<p> What? Were the people in the real estate department saying that the people who work in Building 7 need to get some new hobbies? Or maybe they were just going to put up markers like you see in historic districts, but the markers are going to say something like <i>On this spot in 1998, absolutely nothing interesting happened</i>. </p>
<p> But no, that’s not what the message was about. It was announcing that, in preparation for an expansion of the parking garage, there will be markers placed in the courtyard indicating where drilling will be taking place. The message was merely informational, so people won’t wonder <i>What are these people doing wandering around the courtyard with surveying equipment and making X’s on the patio with spraypaint?</i> </p>
