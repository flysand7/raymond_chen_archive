<p>As I noted before, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/14/10009455.aspx"> many grocery stores in the United States have a printer next to the cash register which prints out coupons customized to your purchases</a>. Here’s a purchase and the accompanying coupon. What is the story behind this pairing?
 Purchased: Diapers for newborn baby.<br/> Coupon: Save 75 cents on ice cream.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: While waiting in line, I read the warning label on the diapers. It went on for quite a bit, but one part triggered my “I wonder what lawsuit led to this warning” sensor: “Like most articles of clothing, XYZ brand diapers will burn if exposed to flame.” Did somebody say, “Oh no, there’s a fire, what will I do? I know, I’ll smother the fire with my baby’s diapered bottom!” </p>
