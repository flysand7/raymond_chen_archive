<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">That $9 you got from the PayPal settlement? Taxable income.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> If you’re like many people, you signed up for <a href="http://www.settlement4onlinepayments.com/"> the PayPal class action lawsuit</a> and got around $9 for filing a claim against the Statutory Damage Fund. My read of <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4345.pdf"> IRS publication 4345</a> says that this constitutes taxable income. Note: This is just my personal opinion. Consult with your tax advisor before taking action. As for me, I reported it. Given <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/17/430195.aspx"> my previous experience with the IRS</a>, I’m willing to fork over the $3 to avoid getting audited.</p>
