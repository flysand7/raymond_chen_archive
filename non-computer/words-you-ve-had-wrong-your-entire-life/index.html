<p>As a child, my mother would always call out “banzai” when she wanted me to raise my arms above my head so she could put on or take off a pullover shirt. I assumed that <i>banzai</i> was the word for “stick your hands in the air!”
 It wasn’t until well into my adult life that my mother explained to me that, no, <i>banzai</i> does not mean “stick your hands in the air.” It’s a Japanese word meaning “ten thousand years”, shouted as a term of approbation and accompanied by (you guessed it) throwing one’s hands into the air. My mother was using it as a play term; in the United States, when you get your child to throw his hands into the air, you might accompany it with a shout of “Touchdown!”
 What words have you gotten wrong your entire life?
