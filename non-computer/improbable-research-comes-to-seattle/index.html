<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Improbable Research comes to Seattle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The lunatics behind <a href="http://www.improbable.com">The Annals of Improbable Research</a> and <a href="http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-top.html">The Ig Nobel Prize</a> will be <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2004/02/improbable_show.html">in Seattle tomorrow night, Feburary 13</a>. The <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/MPE_13_Chron.shtml">meeting schedule</a> lists the AIR presentation as “8:00PM-10:30PM, Special Event: Annals of Improbable Research (open to all registrants), Sheraton Hotel, Third Floor, Metropolitan Ballroom”. The AIR folks said “Open to the public”; maybe they won’t be checking for an AAAS membership card at the door.</p>
