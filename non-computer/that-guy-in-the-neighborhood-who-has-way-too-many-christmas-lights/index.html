<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">That guy in the neighborhood who has way too many Christmas lights</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/"><i>Weekend America</i></a> <a href="http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/12/20/lights/"> profiles Dominic Luberto</a>, that guy with his house so covered in Christmas lights that you’re sure it’s a fire hazard or something. </p>
<p> I like how he pulls out the classic argument stopper when challenged that his display is too much. “Whoever comes against me – listen – goes against the kids.” There you go. In the United States, all you have to do is accuse your opponent of hating children and you have instantly won the argument. </p>
