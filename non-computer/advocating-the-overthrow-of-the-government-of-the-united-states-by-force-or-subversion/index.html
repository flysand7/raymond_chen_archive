<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Advocating the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or subversion</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It has been <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/02/08/south-carolina-now-r.html"> widely reported</a> that South Carolina now <a href="http://rawstory.com/2010/02/south-carolinas-subversive-activities-registration-act-force/"> requires “subversive groups” to register with the Secretary of State</a> (and pay a $5 filing fee).
 Curiously, the list of organizations which must register include “an organization subject to foreign control.” I wonder if this means that all consulates have to register, and that when any foreign dignitary visits South Carolina, they have to pay a $5 filing fee. (Not to mention all foreign-owned companies like Shell Oil.)
 Actually, it has been pointed out that a “subversive organization” includes one which advocates, teaches, or practices the propriety of controlling the government of the United States. I guess this means all political parties are subversive organizations. (Something most of us knew already.)
 And apparently, in your registration, you also have to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/02/08/south-carolina-now-r.html"> include the bylaws or minutes of meetings from the last year</a>. I wonder whether you have to resubmit the minutes each year. I’m sure somebody could keep a government bureaucrat busy for a long time by submitting hundreds of pages of “minutes”.
 Anyway, this is a long and largely superfluous set-up for a different story. The mother of a colleague of mine came to visit from Canada. For some reason, the United States requires visitors to fill out a questionnaire asking them whether they are a drug dealer, whether they are a Nazi war criminal, and this question:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Do you advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force or subversion? </p></blockquote>
<p> The sweet old lady studied the question for a while, then circled <i>force</i>.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus weirdness</b>: On the form, it also says “Answering Yes will not necessarily exclude you from admission to the United States.” </p>
