<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">French schoolchildren invited to draw their impressions of the United States</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>They choose fast food, fat people, and Bush in a tank.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  In January, a cartoon festival was held in the town of Carquefou,  just outside of Nantes in the northwest corner of France.  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/162066_focus29.html">  Students of all ages competed in a contest to illustrate their vision  of the United States</a>.  They drew obese Americans devouring Coca-Cola and McDonald’s hamburgers.  They drew the Statue of Liberty with fangs or in chains or  being run over by a wicked Uncle Sam on a motorcycle.  And they drew George W. Bush:  Bush riding a tank to war;  Bush taking over the world;  Bush as a liar;  Bush as a monster.   </p></blockquote>
<p>  (I love  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/photos/photo.asp?PhotoID=37234">  the drawing of ravenous overweight superheroes</a>.)
  The French image of the United States as the land of hamburgers and  obesity extends beyond the minds of schoolchildren.  It’s also  <a href="http://www.allmovieportal.com/mp/2003_the_triplets_of_belleville_013.html">  one of the salient features of  “Belleville”</a> (a thinly-disguised New York City) in the  <a href="http://www.oscar.com/nominees/nom_33057.html">  Academy Award-Nominated animated film</a> <i><a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/triplets/">The  Triplets of Belleville</a></i>.  (Note: I saw <i>Triplets</i> and found it unsatisfying.)</p>
<p>  (In another case of blog synchrony,  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ericgu/archive/2004/05/27/143423.aspx">  Eric Gunnerson discussed the frustrating trend of “size inflation”</a>.)  </p>
