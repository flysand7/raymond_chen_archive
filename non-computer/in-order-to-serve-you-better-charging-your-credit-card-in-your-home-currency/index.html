<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">In order to serve you better: Charging your credit card in your home currency</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_currency_conversion">Dynamic currency conversion</a> is a service provided by merchants when processing credit cards payable in a foreign currency. Say, for example, you present a credit card issued by a United States bank to a hotel in Ireland, where the Euro is the local currency. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/04/2021921.aspx">In order to serve you better</a>, the hotel will convert the fee from Euros into dollars. </p>
<p>What they don’t tell you is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/29/AR2005072900927.html">they will use a horrible exchange rate for the conversion</a>. </p>
