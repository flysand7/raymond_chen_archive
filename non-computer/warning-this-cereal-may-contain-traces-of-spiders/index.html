<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Warning: This cereal may contain traces of spiders</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In a Lisbon grocery store, I was looking at the ingredient panel of a box of cereal. It contained the information in multiple languages, and French came first. I was momentarily stunned by the following warning: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Traces possibles d’<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arachide">arachide</a>s. </p></blockquote>
<p> I guess this falls in the category of “Raymond misreads French cereal box warnings.” </p>
