<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Welcome to Leavenworth, Washington’s faux-Bavarian village</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The dying logging town of <a href="http://www.leavenworth.org/"> Leavenworth, Washington</a> reinvented itself in the 1960’s as a faux-Bavarian village. Today, over a million tourists visit annually to enjoy the scenic mountain views, soak in the fake Bavarian atmosphere, and revel in events like the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2009328901_accordion12.html"> Leavenworth International Accordion Celebration</a> which starts tomorrow, or the three-weekend-long <a href="http://www.leavenworthoktoberfest.com/"> Leavenworth Oktoberfest</a> every October. (Mind you, the Leavenworth Oktoberfest doesn’t actually start until the Munich Oktoberfest is nearly over, because Oktoberfest starts in <i>September</i>.)</p>
<p> I found during a brief visit to Leavenworth that the people there may dress like they’re from Bavaria, but they don’t actually speak German. </p>
<p> But at least I was there undercover. </p>
<p> Some years ago, a colleague of mine was on assignment in Redmond from his home country of Austria. One weekend, he decided to pay a visit to our fake Bavarian village, and when he returned, we asked him what he thought of the town. </p>
<p> “Well, for a <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030430&amp;slug=leavenworth30m"> fake Bavarian village</a>, it’s not too bad. I mean, nobody would for a moment think it was the real thing, but I appreciate the effort they went to, and it was quite a pleasant little town. But the weird thing was what happened whenever I opened my mouth to speak: People recognized that I spoke with a German accent and a flash of panic crossed their faces, as if I was going to blow the cover off their little ruse and reveal it to be a fraud.” </p>
