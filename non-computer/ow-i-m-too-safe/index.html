<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Ow, I'm too safe!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my friends is a geek, and, naturally, fully researches everything he does, from cement pouring to bicycle parts, perhaps a bit obsessively. He made sure to get five-point restraints for his children’s car seats, for example. And he naturally tightens the belts snugly when putting his children in the car.
 At one point, as he was strapping <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/27/9570320.aspx"> his daughter</a> in, she complained, “Ow! I’m too safe!”</p>
<p> Because as far as she was concerned, “being safe” was a synonym for “having a tight seat belt.” I leave you to figure out how she came to this conclusion. </p>
