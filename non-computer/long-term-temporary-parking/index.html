<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Long-term temporary parking?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> On my way to work, I saw a Notice of Proposed Land Use Action. The proposed new use for the property was listed as <i>long-term temporary parking</i>. </p>
<p> What the heck is long-term temporary parking? </p>
