<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Marymoor Park summer movie series 2005 is nearly over</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002417668_movies03e.html"> Every Wednesday evening in August of this year, Marymoor Park will be showing a movie</a>. Tonight’s movie is <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i>. The movie begins at dusk, and a $5 donation is suggested, proceeds to be shared between the park and a local charity. The charity tends to be thematically related to the movie; for <i>Beckham</i>, for example, part of the money will go to the Lake Washington Youth Soccer Association.</p>
