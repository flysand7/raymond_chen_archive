<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Seattle boating season opens but never closes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This past weekend was <a href="http://www.seattleyachtclub.org/OpeningDay"> Opening Day of the Seattle boating season</a>. This tends to create traffic chaos in the Montlake neighborhood, which leads to confusing newspaper headlines like <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002973247_here05m.html"> <i>Opening Day closure</i></a>. I remember many years ago asking a boat-owning colleague, “So, when does boating season close?”
 “Oh, <a href="http://www.seattleyachtclub.org/OpeningDay/History"> it doesn’t close</a>.”
 “Then why do they have an Opening Day for something that hasn’t closed?”</p>
<p> “It gives the slacker fair-weather boaters a target date to get their boats back in condition. It really should be called something like Bring Out Your Boats Day.” </p>
