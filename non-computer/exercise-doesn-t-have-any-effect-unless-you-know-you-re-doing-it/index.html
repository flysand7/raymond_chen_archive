<p> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17792517"> Hotel maids began losing weight once they were informed that their normal job activities counted as exercise</a>. I can’t want for somebody to test whether this placebo effect works in reverse; that is, whether you will lose weight if you aren’t actually exercising but <i>believe that you are</i>. If it works, then sign me up! (Oh rats, they addressed this in the interview.)</p>
