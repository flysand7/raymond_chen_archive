<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploring the Supercute World of Hello Kitty</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s still time to get to the <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org/calendar/events/hello-kitty-supercute-opening-party.aspx">Hello Kitty Supercute Opening Party</a> at the <a href="http://www.empmuseum.org/">Experience Music Project</a>, kicking off a four-month exhibition of <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/record-breaking-exhibition-exploring-the-phenomenon-of-hello-kitty-coming-to-emp-on-november-14-2015-300136985.html">Everything Hello Kitty</a>. (Here are pictures from <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/12/23/hello-exploring-the-superweir.html">the Los Angeles leg of the tour</a>.) </p>
<p>Curiously, one of the events on the agenda for the opening night gala is a “Q&amp;A with Hello Kitty” at 8:00pm, which is going to be interesting, seeing as Hello Kitty does not have a mouth. </p>
<p>One of the exhibit’s sponsors is <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/us/">UNIQLO</a>, who I should remind you, has <a href="http://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/">a very strange clock</a>. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: EVA Air now has a thrice-weekly flight <a href="http://evakitty.evaair.com/en/FlightRoutes.aspx">between Taipei and Houston</a>, so you can now fly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/30/8440202.aspx">Hello Kitty Air</a> from the United States. </p>
