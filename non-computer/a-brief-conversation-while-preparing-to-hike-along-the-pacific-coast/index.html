<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A brief conversation while preparing to hike along the Pacific coast</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, one of my colleagues (who happens to be an avid outdoorsy person with a dry sense of humor) assembled a small group of people to take a long weekend hike <a href="http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/cape-alava-sand-point-loop/"> along the Capa Alava Trail</a> and then <a href="http://www.windsox.us/SPARES/JJ.html"> north along the Pacific coast</a>. As we gathered in the parking lot midday Friday with our backpacking gear, another of our colleagues (whom I will call “Mary”) walked past and the following conversation ensued:
 Mary: “Hey, where ya goin’? (joking) That way I can call Search and Rescue if I don’t see you on Monday.”
 Bob: “We’re heading out to Lake Ozette.”
 Mary: “Cool, where’s Lake Ozette?”</p>
<p> Bob: “That’s okay, Search and Rescue knows where it is.” </p>
