<p> A few years ago, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/12/12/PM200512126.html"> Marketplace radio looks at those portraits used by the Wall Street Journal</a>, known as <i>hedcuts</i>. Believe it or not, these drawings are hand-done, not computer-generated. <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/journal/intro2.htm"> View the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery online exhibition</a> to see, for example, how Steve Jobs’s portrait has changed over the years.</p>
