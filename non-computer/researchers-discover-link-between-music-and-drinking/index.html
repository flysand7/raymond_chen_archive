<p> <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=583&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20031006/od_nm/odd_music_dc">A     British scientific study shows that a bit of classical music can persuade diners to     buy more fancy coffees, pricey wines and luxurious desserts</a>. “North has shown     that playing German or French music can persuade diners to buy wine from those countries.”     I found this to be true in my experience. If you get two thousand people in a tent     and play live oom-pah music, they end up drinking lots of German beer.  </p>
