<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Tintin goes to the neurologist</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/"> Canadian Medical Association Journal</a> traditionally runs an offbeat research paper in their Christmas edition, for which there is apparently huge competition. This year, <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/171/12/1433"> Tintin goes to the neurologist</a>. <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/eletters/171/12/1433"> The feedback is fun to read too</a>. (External news coverage <a href="http://www.canada.com/health/story.html?id=349ccbfb-77bc-4f5d-b5d1-de7919f4b17e"> here</a> and <a href="http://abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1261170.htm"> here</a>.)</p>
<p> My first exposure to Tintin was—of course—in Sweden. (Why “of course”? Because it seems that everything I do ties back to Sweden somehow…) </p>
<p> While browsing through a music store’s clearance bin, I found an audio dramatization of <i><a href="http://www.boecker.nu/tecknat/tintin7.htm">Den svarta ön</a></i>. I recognized “Tintin” as the name of a popular children’s character, though I myself had never read any of the stories. </p>
<p> I started listening to the CD and found the story amazingly dull. However, I chalked this up to my bad Swedish listening comprehension, figuring that if only I understood more of it, the story would be more enjoyable. </p>
<p> Some months later, I tested this theory: I went to the library, found a copy of <i>The Black Island</i> in English translation, and read it. </p>
<p> It was an amazingly dull story. </p>
<p> During my most recent trip to Taiwan, the person I was telling this story to couldn’t figure out what children’s character I was talking about. We happened to be in a bookstore and I stumbled across a copy of <a href="http://www.booksea.com/humor/mh/a/aierre/dingding/heidao/"> the same story in Chinese translation</a>. (The Chinese translation of Tintin’s name is <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=4E01"> 丁</a><a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=4E01"> 丁</a> – dīng-dīng, in case anybody else finds themselves in the same jam.) Of course, having found the book, I had to buy it; it’s sort of become a collection now. Someday I’ll try to read it, but not quite yet. My Chinese is barely at phrase-book level right now. </p>
<p> It has been pointed out that even though Tintin is ostensibly a journalist, over his 45-year career he filed but one story. You’d think his editor would be kind of upset by now. </p>
<p> I also have copies of <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i> in all (but one) of the various languages I know or am trying to learn. And I’m counting the American and British English versions as different. Because they are. </p>
