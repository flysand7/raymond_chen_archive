<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can you trust the Man on the Street interview?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Occasionally, in a news story, the reporter will ask for comments or opinion from a passer-by (nicknamed “the man on the street”). <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_051305_man.html"> Greg Packer has created a second career as that man</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  In the last 10 years, he’s been quoted at least a dozen times by the New York Post. He’s been quoted at least 14 times by the Daily News, most recently just last week. He was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution two weeks ago. And Packer has been quoted or photographed at least 16 times on separate occasions by the Associated Press. … </p>
<p> [H]e checks the newspapers for concerts, sports games, parades, book signings – anywhere media trucks might be camped out. Then, he requests time off from his job as a highway worker on Long Island and shows up early, scanning the crowd for reporters. </p>

<p> It got so bad that the Associated Press issued an internal memo instructing reporters not to talk to the guy any more!
 That story from <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org"> <i>On the Media</i></a> reminded me of a related incident back when the hype surrounding <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i> was building. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> sent a reporter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/051399phantom-tickets.html"> to cover the people who had been waiting in line for months</a>. The first person interviewed is Sangay Kumar, who claims to have flown in from Bombay just to see the movie.
 A friend of mine read the article and started laughing.</p>
<p> Because my friend knows Mr. Kumar, who it turns out is not actually from Bombay. He’s from Baltimore. He was just waiting in line with everybody else and saw a reporter coming and decided to put on a campy Indian accent and make up a nutty story. And the reporter bought it. </p>
