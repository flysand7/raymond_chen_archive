<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How am I supposed to print my print-at-home tickets if I can’t reproduce them?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I ordered some tickets online and was sent to a Web page which displayed the tickets (with bar codes and stuff), with instructions to print them out. </p>
<p>The Web page also had this big warning on it: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>IT IS UNLAWFUL TO REPRODUCE THIS TICKET IN ANY FORM. </p></blockquote>
<p>Um, this is a print-at-home ticket. The entire reason for its existence is to be reproduced in printed form. </p>
<p>I printed it anyway. </p>
<p>Nobody arrested me. </p>
