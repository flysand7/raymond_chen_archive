<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Grass jelly may be an Asian drink, but it's not crazy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/"> Chris Pirillo</a> <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/nexus/news/2007/04/16/crazy-asian-drinks/"> discovered</a> <a href="http://www.noapologiespress.com/presents/asiandrink/"> Crazy Asian Drinks</a>, a Web site devoted to the beverage preferences of people from the eastern part of Asia. Now, the text is really funny (which is important), but I would like to come to the defense of <a href="http://www.noapologiespress.com/presents/asiandrink/grassjelly.html"> grass jelly drink</a>.
 First of all, when I was growing up, grass jelly wasn’t a drink. It was a dessert. It came in a block, and you diced it up into pieces about one cubic centimeter in size—not the microscopic flecks that you end up in the beveragicized version. You put a few spoonfuls of it in a bowl and stirred in some sugar water and crushed ice. Of course, you had to crush the ice yourself by hand, because that’s the way it was done; it built up the anticipation. (You had to crush it uphill both ways.) When you assembled the dessert, you ate it with a spoon.
 This grass jelly drink is just a pale imitation of the original. It’s like if somebody mocked Jell-O gelatin because it was served to them pureed in a shot glass.</p>
