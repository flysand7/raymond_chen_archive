<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I didn't realize that it was International Group B Strep Awareness Month</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I guess they’re not doing a particularly good job of creating awareness because it wasn’t until I consulted <a href="http://www.healthfinder.gov/library/nho/nho.asp"> the 2006 National Health Observances calendar</a> that the month of July is International Group B Strep Awareness Month.
 For some reason, July and August are pretty light on the health observances calendar. Maybe because people are on summer vacation.
 Who decides whether a particular health observance merits a day, a week, or a month? You’d think they’d save the months for the really big issues, seeing as there are only twelve of them. And for some reason, ultraviolet radiation gets <strong>two</strong> months. May is Ultraviolet Awareness Month, and July is UV Safety Month. That’s one sixth of the year dedicated to ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p> (I’m not belittling the health causes themselves, just the way they get assigned days on the calendar.) </p>
