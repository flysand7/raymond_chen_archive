<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Another type of misplaced apology: Apologizing for not knowing the penalty</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> You may remember this story from a few years ago. A college student printed his own bar codes (for inexpensive items), placed them over the bar code for expensive items, then went through the register and ended up paying <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/technology/5449909/detail.html"> $4.99 for a $149.99 iPod</a>, for example. Ironically, he would have gotten off lighter if he had merely shoplifted the items, because manufacturing fake bar codes brings the crime to the level of forgery, a felony. </p>
<p> But what really struck me was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/26/1763692.aspx"> the nature of the apology</a>. He didn’t say, “I should not have done it,” or even the unconvincing “I didn’t know it was wrong”  He said, “<a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1202052boy3.html">I did this not knowing of the serious penalty that lies behind it</a>.” In other words, “I only break the law when the penalty is mild!” </p>
