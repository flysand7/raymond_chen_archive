<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Chewing gum legalized in Singapore</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/05/25/financial0006EDT0009.DTL">  After twelve years, Singapore  has relaxed its ban on chewing gum</a>.  But not so fast.  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  Before Singaporeans think about unwrapping a pack of Wrigley’s Orbit gum  that’s just started selling here — and only in pharmacies —  they must submit their names and ID card numbers.  If they don’t, pharmacists who sell them gum could be jailed  up to two years and fined 5,000 Singapore dollars ($2,940).  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Chewing gum, or more precisely the threat of chewing gum,  is employed in the wonderful movie  <i><a href="http://www.lovehkfilm.com/panasia/i_not_stupid.htm">I  Not Stupid</a></i>,  which I heartily recommend.  It seems to revel in the mixed feelings Singaporeans harbor  towards their own culture.  (My favorite character is the chubby kid.)  </p>
