<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Washington 2008 unclaimed property auction</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> After five years, the contents of abandoned safe deposit boxes are turned over to the state, which attempts to contact the owners, but if the owners cannot be located after three years, <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/safedeposit08dec.html"> they are put up for auction</a>. Things like <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/2.jpg"> this antique watch with a Swedish dedication</a>: “Till min kära syster Nanny fr. Elin — Mors klocka” = “To my dear sister Nanny, from Elin — Mom’s watch”. It’s sad that something with such obvious sentimental value is being sold off. </p>
<p> Or, if you are more of the nerdy type, you could bid on <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1531.jpg"> Star Trek <strike>comic books</strike> graphic novels</a> or a <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1641.jpg"> Michael Jordan rookie trading card</a>. </p>
