<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nicolas Bourbaki, perhaps the biggest inside joke in mathematics</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> If you’ve studied advanced mathematics, you’ve certainly read or at least heard about the books and papers of the great French mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki, whose works in the 1930’s set out a rigorous formulation of modern mathematics. <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6503411"> Except he never actually existed</a>. The name was created as a front for a group of renegade French mathematicians who were reacting to Poincaré’s intuitive approach. </p>
<p> In modern graph theory, I’m told that it is fashionable to publish one’s results under false names. For example, the graph theorist <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22gw+peck%22"> G. W. Peck</a> was actually a collaboration of the mathematicians <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/facresearch/facultyprofiles/GrahamR.html"> Ronald Graham</a>, <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~west/"> Douglas West</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.uc.edu/people/faculty/dr-george-purdy"> George Purdy</a>, the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s"> Paul Erdős</a>, <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~fan/">Fan Chung</a>, and <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~djk/"> Daniel Kleitman</a>. (Take the initials of the members’ last names.) I learned from Dr. West that the group did not include him originally, and they were prepared to publish under the name “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/">G. Peck</a>“, listing the author’s address as Hollywood, California. With the addition of a new member, the name changed to “G. W. Peck”, which to the group’s pleasant surprise happened to be <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000176"> the name of a United States Congressman from the 19th century</a>, which gave them the opportunity to include a photograph and a short biography that ended with something like “After retiring from Congress, Peck returned to his first love: graph theory.” </p>
