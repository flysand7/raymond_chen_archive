<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The dangers of conversation fragments: Overheard on the Burke-Gilman trail</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This past weekend, a group of us went on one last training ride before the <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/"> STP</a>, which begins tomorrow. The Burke-Gilman is a multipurpose trail, with bicyclists sharing the path with walkers, joggers, inline skaters, sometimes even people on horseback. (Inline nitpicker’s corner: The horseback riders are on the Sammamish River Trail, which is technically a different trail from the Burke-Gilman even though the two connect seamlessly.)
 As you cycle past a group, you can sometimes catch a few words of conversation. Usually, those words are not noteworthy at all. “…said to her…” or “…opened up…” or “…whenever the…”
 Except when I passed one pair of walkers, I heard one of them say “…concentration camp…”
 <b>Traffic alert</b></p>
<p> According to the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Northwest/King/Construction/#520Closure"> Washington State Department of Transportation Construction Updates web site</a>, “Crews will completely close SR 520 between Montlake Blvd. and 108th Avenue NE from 11 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday for the annual maintenance and inspection.” Curiously, this isn’t losted on the <a href="http://wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/trafficalerts/default.aspx?route=SR%20520&amp;view=main&amp;action=3"> SR 520 Travel Alerts</a> page. </p>
