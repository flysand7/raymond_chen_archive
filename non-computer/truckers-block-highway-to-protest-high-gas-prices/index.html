<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Truckers block highway to protest high gas prices</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://cbs2.com/localnews/localnewsla_story_121140711.html"> <!-- "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56822-2004Apr30.html" -->  To protest rising gasoline prices, a group of truckers  abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the highway</a>.  It struck me as odd that  a country that brims with anti-French rhetoric  would adopt one of their protest techniques.  </p>
<p>  Presumably they don’t want French gasoline prices either.  </p>
