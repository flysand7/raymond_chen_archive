<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Commissioner Bud Selig was named the first recipient of the Commissioner Bud Selig Leadership Award</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In what was sure to have been a stunning surprise, last night, the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/baseball-assistance-team-bat-creates-selig-leadership-award-will-present-honor-at-going-to-bat-dinner?ymd=20131205&amp;content_id=64413938"> first annual Commissioner Bud Selig Leadership Award</a> was given out. And the winner was… <a href="http://www.mlbcommunity.org/programs/baseball_assistance_team.jsp?content=dinner"> Allan H. “Bud” Selig</a>!
 I wonder who will win next year.
 Or who will win the Bud Selig Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
<p> Perhaps just to save time, they will name Bud Selig the Bud Selig Leadership Award Recipient For Life. </p>
