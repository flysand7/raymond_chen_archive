<p>I was in the supermarket looking for cold medicine,  and as is my wont,  I like to read the fine print before choosing a product.  Most of the products listed their active ingredients in the form  <i>Active Ingredient: XYZ 150mg</i>.  But there were a few that said  <i>Active Ingredient: XYZ 6X</i>.
  What is this <i>6X</i>?  How much is 6X?  Six times what?
  A closer look at the box reveals the word  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">Homeopathic</a></i>  unobtrusively written towards the bottom of the box.  The 6X notation means that the active ingredient’s concentration is  one part in 10<sup>6</sup>, or one part in a million.
  Suppose the dosage is one teaspoon.  That’s about five milliliters, or about five grams of medicine.  One millionth of that is 5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> of a gram  or 0.005 milligrams.  By comparison,  non-homeopathic medicines contain 13mg of the same medicine per dose.  But that’s okay, because practitioners of homeopathy believe that  a medicine becomes more powerful the more heavily it is diluted.
  The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate homeopathic  medicines very much at all  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html">  because they contain little or no active ingredients</a>.
  Do practitioners of homeopathy not wash their hands?  After all, diluting the germs with water makes them stronger, right?  The more you wash, the more powerful they become!
