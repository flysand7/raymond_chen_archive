<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">iPhone pricing as economic experiment</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in 2005, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132071/"> <i>Slate</i>‘s Tim Harford wondered why Microsoft didn’t raise the introductory price of Xbox 360 game consoles</a>. With the price set at $300, lines were long and shortages were many. <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2132988/"> Harford’s readers came up with their own theories</a> for resisting the laws of supply and demand and holding to a fixed price.
 The Xbox 360 is hardly unique in this respect. When there’s a hot product, manufacturers hold to the original price and let the lines grow, the shortages fester, and the customers get more frustrated. Think <i>Tickle Me Elmo</i> or <i>Cabbage Patch Kids</i>. Even though from an economic-theoretical standpoint, a product that has sold out with unmet demand is a product whose price was set too low.</p>
<p> With the iPhone, Apple unwittingly ran the experiment that Harford proposed. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/23/6475512.aspx"> There were lines</a>, but by some reports, <a href="http://www.switched.com/2007/06/28/iphone-this-ain-t-no-ps3-launch/"> the lines weren’t all that bad</a>. After the initial demand subsided, Apple did what the economists say they should have done: They lowered the price. And the people who bought the phones at the higher price complained (forcing Apple to offer a store credit) and <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20070930/000359.shtml"> one of them even sued</a>. <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2174391/"> <i>Slate</i>‘s Daniel Gross opines on the lessons learned</a>. </p>
