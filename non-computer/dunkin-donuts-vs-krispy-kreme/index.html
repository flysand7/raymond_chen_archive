<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dunkin Donuts vs. Krispy Kreme</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Having grown up on the east coast, I imprinted on <a href="http://www.dunkindonuts.com/">Dunkin Donuts</a>. Once a month we would stop at DD on the way home and buy a shoebox of doughnuts.  Toasted coconut and butternut, those were my favorites.
 Ironically, Dunkin Donuts is really a coffee shop disguised as a doughnut shop.  (Doughnuts account for only 20% of their sales; coffee 50%.)
 So during my travels through Manhattan, I walked past one of the twenty-five zillion Dunkin Donuts stores there and popped in for a toasted coconut doughnut. One bite and I was a little kid again.
 Some people say that DD’s doughnuts are awful, but that’s pretty much irrelevant to me by now. It’s all about the memories that are invoked.</p>
<p> And besides, those people are wrong. I don’t understand the appeal of KK donuts. They have no flavor; it’s just sugar. </p>
