<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A little cheat in my Tiger Beat photo homage</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One thing nobody has called out in my <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/raymond-chen/"> tribute to the Bill Gates Tiger Beat photo</a>, either because it was too subtle or too obvious, is that the photo is actually a mirror image.
 The arrangement of furniture in the room was not correct: The big table was on the wrong side of the room. It was also too heavy to move around, so we cheated. We staged the entire picture as a mirror image, flipping the Windows screen shot. And then back in the virtual darkroom, <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/WM_IN/Ariel-Stallings-Microspotting-the-Empire/"> Ariel</a> flipped the photo to put the furniture on the correct side of the photo.</p>
<p> Here are the clues in the photo: </p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>SONY</i> logo on the monitor. </li>
<li>The <i>Multiscan G500</i> and <i>Trinitron</i> branding on the monitor. </li>
<li>The <i>Microsoft</i> logos on the binder on the table. </li>
<li>The arrows on the recycle bin propping open the door. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Chatter</b>: The day after I put this article into the queue (which makes it visible to Microsoft employees), somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/26/10436961.aspx#10437643"> posted a comment pointing it out</a>. Coincidence? You decide. </p>
