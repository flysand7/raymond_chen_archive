<p> The Washington State Association of County Auditors have <a href="http://makemyvotecount.info/"> a web site explaining steps people need to take to ensure their vote is counted properly</a>. Unfortunately, the auditors didn’t review what the web design team came up with, because their page on <a href="http://makemyvotecount.info/marking.htm"> how to mark your ballot</a> is illustrated with a cute graphic with a check-mark. Too bad the check mark is the <strong>wrong</strong> way to cast your vote in every single county in Washington. For written ballots, you’re supposed to fill in the square or circle completely, not use a check-mark. </p>
<p> You’d think after all these years I’d eventually get this voting thing down. Most years, I make a wrong turn looking for my polling place. This year, I focused and managed to get there without any mistakes, only to find that I forgot to bring my voting registration card. (Actually, I usually forget my card most years. I’ve gotten pretty good at looking up my name in the book.) </p>
