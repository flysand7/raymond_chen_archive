<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Tips for planning your ship party</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Not saying how I know these things. Just making a little list for reference.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you plan on staying dry, do not hold the party near a fountain. (Note that fountain avoidance is a necessary but not sufficient criterion.)</li>
<li>Corollary: If your team members have an armory of super soaker water cannons, and you plan on staying dry, then absolutely do not hold the party near a fountain.</li>
<li>Unrolled spools of bubble wrap are a poor choice of equipment when trying to climb from the lobby to the upper floor balcony.</li>
<li>After discovering that bubble wrap is unsuitable for climbing, do not upend a glass table in an attempt to gain a higher starting point.</li>
<li>A contest to see who can run and break through a plaster wall is not a recommended choice of impromptu amusement.</li>
<li>Do not throw a couch from the upper floor balcony. Not even if it’s on fire.</li>
<li>Costco underwear does not count as swim trunks.</li>
<li>Do not have a tug of war over a vat of Jell-O.</li>
<li>The expensive sculpture outside your building is not a water storage tank in need of refilling.</li>
<li>Exercise caution when driving your motorcycle through the halls. The carpet damage from your burnout can be repaired, but the patches never really look the same.</li>
<li>On the day of the ship party, do not wear a nice suit. You might be thrown into the back of a pick-up truck and buried in ice.</li>
</ul>
