<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Apparently I can't take myself anywhere</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Upon arriving at the office, I unpack my bicycle bag and remove a crisp new white shirt. I change into my work clothes, and then at 11am, I head to lunch as I usually do. (This is the lunch group that includes <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffdav/">JeffDav</a> and occasionally <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bencon/">BenCon</a>.) I get a sandwich, sit down, and immediately drip sauce on my brand new shirt. Can’t even keep a shirt clean for two hours. Fortunately, I keep a spare shirt in my office so I am able to change and give the now-no-longer-purely-white shirt a bit of a wash in the bathroom sink before the stain set. </p>
