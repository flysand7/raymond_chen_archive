<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Celebrating the end of the gluttony season, but the effects linger</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Washington State Ferry system has reduced the rated carrying capacity of its fleet because <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/ap/transportation/obesity-rise-prompts-wash-ferries-capacity-change/nF7FZ/"> people have gotten fatter</a>: The average weight of an adult passenger has been officially revised from 160 pounds to 185 pounds. (That’s from 11 stone 6 to 13 stone 3 in the UK, or from 73kg to 84kg for the rest of the world.)
 This has happened before: In 1999, the rated capacity of Washington State ferries dropped when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/health/nutritionfit/stories/seats041599hp.htm"> the previous method for determining seating density was abandoned</a> due to passengers’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY84MRnxVzo#t=30s"> big butts</a>. (I recall that <i>The Seattle Times</i> printed a ruler next to the article so that for readers could <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asses"> assess</a> their own situation.)
 In other news: Many hospitals, such as our own University of Washington Medical Center, have installed ceiling lifts in all their rooms <a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_27cb026e-e0e8-11e0-bafc-001cc4c03286.html"> due to the high number of obese patients</a>.</p>
<p> (The gluttony seasons begins on Hallowe’en and ends on Christmas, as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/13/10224266.aspx"> officially</a> declared by me.) </p>
