<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I reorganized your kitchen for you, sweetie</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I suspect most people are familiar with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/07/8080064.aspx#8102228"> <i>It may be a mess, but it’s my mess and I know where everything is</i></a> phenomenon. That doesn’t necessarily mean that items are in the best location, but at least you know which suboptimal location you chose.
 <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> :: Wendy ::</a> told me a story some time ago about something that happened while her parents were visiting. When she returned from work, her mother said, “Oh, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Darling"> Wendy, darling</a>, I reorganized your kitchen for you. You had everything in the wrong place.”
 Wendy’s mother was trying to be helpful, but of course it was a net loss for poor Wendy, who couldn’t find anything in her kitchen for weeks. Yes, there was the whole <i>Oh great where did my mother put my food processor?</i> problem, but even after she found it, the “improved” location was far worse than its original location. In fact, in many cases, it was in the exact opposite location from where it should be.</p>
<p> You see, Wendy is left-handed, and her mother is right-handed. </p>
