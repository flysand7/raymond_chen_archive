<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What I don’t get about bank robbers</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> My reaction to the news story about the so-called <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/03/07/teen.bandits/"> Barbie Bandits</a> wasn’t disbelief or shock at the crime, but rather confusion over their over-arching plan. People rob a bank and use the money to buy stuff. Dude, cut out the federal crime; just steal the stuff directly. </p>
<p> When I expressed this disbelief at the lunch table, one of my colleagues took issue with my assessment. “Oh, no, the food in state prison is awful. Federal is much better.” </p>
