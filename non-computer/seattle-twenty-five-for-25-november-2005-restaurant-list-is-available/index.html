<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Seattle Twenty-Five for $25 November 2005 restaurant list is available</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A regular restaurant promotion in the Seattle area is called <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/contests/restaurants/25for25_1105/"> Twenty-Five for $25</a> (The “$” is silent). Other cities have their own versions of this. New York’s is called <a href="http://www.downtownny.com/?sid=35"> Restaurant Week</a>, for example, and Toronto’s is called (I am not making this up) <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/special_events/wintercity/winterlicious.htm"> Winterlicious</a>.</p>
<p> The common theme is that participating restaurants offer a <i>prix fixe</i> menu for a reduced price. Twenty-Five for $25 offers dinner for $25 or lunch for $12.50. Restaurant Week offers lunch for $20.05 (the price goes up by a penny each year); some restaurants also offer dinner for $30.05. Winterlicious’s menus are C$10/$20 for lunch and C$20/$30 for dinner. </p>
<p> If your city offers these promotions, I strongly encourage you to give them a try. It’s a great way to eat at a fine restaurant without destroying your wallet. Plus, the portions are much more reasonably-sized. </p>
<p> One thing that I do miss in Seattle is “pre-theater dinners”. In London, the restaurants in the theater district have special menus designed to offer you a leisurely dinner while still getting you out in time to catch your show. In Seattle, you’re on your own to make sure you get out in time, which can be a challenge when the restaurant doesn’t seem to be playing on your team. </p>
