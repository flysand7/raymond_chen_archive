<p>It appears that the country of Burundi <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/newswire/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425159"> used a freelance photographer’s image on their currency without permission</a>. (If the article goes down, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/06/photographer_sues_af.html"> BoingBoing saved a side-by-side comparison</a> for your inspection.) The article adds that</p>

<p> I guess nobody remembered that the initial design for the Euro <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/slideshow/money_talks/slide2.stm"> included images</a> taken from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0760312346?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0760312346"> <i>Bridges: Three Thousand Years of Defying Nature</i></a>.
 The theory must have been that there’s no room for footnotes on a banknote. (Though the Bank of England found room for <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2000/093.htm"> a copyright notice</a>.)</p>
<p> (On a tangential note, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6358691"> Kazakhstan misspelled the word “bank” on their notes</a>.) </p>
