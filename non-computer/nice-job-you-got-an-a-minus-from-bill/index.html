<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nice job, you got an A minus from Bill</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Bill Gates does not praise lightly. </p>
<p>Some time ago, a colleague of mine helped to prepared a keynote address for Bill Gates. Afterward, he was informed that Bill rated the presentation an “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">A minus</a>“. </p>
<p>My colleague thought, “Wow, an A minus. It would be great to get some feedback from Bill about where I could have done better.” </p>
<p>Bill’s assistant explained, “Don’t worry. That’s the highest grade he gives.” </p>
