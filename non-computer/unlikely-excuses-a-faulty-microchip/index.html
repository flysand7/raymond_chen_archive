<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Unlikely excuses: A faulty microchip</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6386613"> a talking action figure was discovered to utter a curse word</a>. A spokesperson for the store said that the problem might be a faulty microchip.
 Huh? What microchips fail by saying curse words?
 I mean, I can see the voice chip failing by generating static or chopping up the audio so as to become unintelligible, but what are the odds that a chip will just happen to fail by reassembling the audio to form a popular curse word?</p>
<p> Mind you, the problem may still end up having a benign explanation. Apparently, <a href="http://www.local6.com/family/10162214/detail.html"> the recording is supposed to be of the word “stop”</a>. Maybe the recording quality is so poor that people can mis-hear it as another word. But that’s not the same as a faulty microchip. </p>
