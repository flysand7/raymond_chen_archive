<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The DHS television show was all a scam, it appears</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.xeni.net/bio.php"> Xeni Jardin</a> on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/"> Boing Boing</a> reports that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/10/87248.aspx"> the DHS series I mentioned a while back</a> was <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/25/dhs_the_series_the_s.html"> all an elaborate scam to bilk investors out of millions</a>. (One tip-off has got to be that they changed their domain name from <a href="http://www.dhs.tv/">www.dhs.tv</a> to <a href="http://www.dhstheseries.tv/"> www.dhstheseries.tv</a>. And curiously, their “News” page just says <code>P ALIGN"LEFT"/P</code>.) <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/25/dhs_the_series_the_s.html"> Read Ms. Jardin’s article</a> for more linkity goodness. I guess this has a good side: It means no FEMA episode.</p>
