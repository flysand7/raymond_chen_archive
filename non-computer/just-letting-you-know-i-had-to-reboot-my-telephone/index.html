<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Just letting you know I had to reboot my telephone</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Shortly after my group got switched over to new fancy-dancy IP phones, one of my colleagues sent me email to say “This morning, when I picked up the phone, I kept getting a ‘URL not allowed’ error. I fixed it by rebooting my phone.”</p>
<p> So this is what the world has come to. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: As many readers surmised, these “new” IP phones arrived <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/21/9557783.aspx#9560350"> over a year ago</a>. On the other hand, I never did get to learn all the features of the device before it was replaced with a different model of IP phone. Progress. </p>
