<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The advantage of knowing your limits of discrimination</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A story a while back about <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/calling-bullshit/james-randi-offers-1-million-if-audiophiles-can-prove-7250-speaker-cables-are-better-305549.php"> ridiculously expensive speaker cables</a> and  <a href="http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-09/092807reply.html#i4"> James Randi’s challenge</a> to tell the difference between them and modestly-priced cables reminded me of a conversation I had with a wine-loving friend of mine.
 He went on a wine tasting tour and sampled wines of varying quality and price. His conclusion was that he could detect the correlation between price and quality up until about $75/bottle. Beyond that point, the wines all tasted roughly equally great.
 Conclusion: There’s no point in my friend spending more than about $75 on a bottle of wine. Once you know the limit of your discrimination, you can use it to avoid wasting money. (One might argue that this is one advantage of having a coarse palate: You can get away with cheaper wine!)</p>
