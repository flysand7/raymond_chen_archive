<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of sev^H^H^Heighth graders: What it means to be an adult</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Since I’m obviously a glutton for punishment, I also helped read eighth grade essays on the same topic: Describe the qualities you consider to be those which make someone an adult. As always, remember that these are just the funny sentences/excerpts.</p>
<p> <b>Let me tell you about my parents</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>My dad looks older for one reason because he has facial hair. </li>
<li>[My father] doesn’t look young and muscular like most teens do. </li>
<li>Some people are just plain dumb, but not my dad. </li>
<li>My dad works at his extremely boring Job every day. </li>
<li>If you slack on your work and     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="lag">lagger</span>     behind     you won’t have a good image when people think of you.     Fortunately, my dad has covered this quality.     <i>Your dad is a slacker?</i> </li>
<li>He is a photographer so he has to work with a lot of people.     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="A lot">Alot</span>     of those people are ignorant and stuffy politicians. </li>
<li>My dad goes down to Seattle practically every day     and does stuff I’m not totally sure about but he’s a lawyer. </li>
<li>My dad is an adult because [he] makes a budget     so he can pay the bills on time,     so we can keep our house and not get our car     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="towed">toed</span>.     <i>It’s called     <a href="http://www.familycar.com/Alignment.htm#Toe">     wheel alignment</a>, and toeing is a good thing.</i> </li>
<li>My dad is an adult partly because he     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="made">mad</span>     it through     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="high school">highschool</span>     and     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="college">collage</span>.     <i>I wonder whether he majored in anger management.</i> </li>
<li>My Dad… !! yayz! </li>
<li>Three children and a wife can be a real hassle,     some people can’t even handle one. </li>
<li>[Dad] recently had this mid life crisis I believe,     he went kind of crazy and bought all this equipment for making music.     He made his songs, and then kinda transitioned back to normal. </li>
<li>He has engendered a family. </li>
<li>In all     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="to">te</span>     be considered an adult you have to be at or over 18.     And I assure you my mom is well over 18. </li>
<li>College also gave her [my mother] a social experience.     This is important because it gave her a dose of     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="adulthood">adultery</span>.     <i>Does your father know this?</i> </li>
<li>My mom is always my home skillet biscuit.     <i>Fo’ shizzle.</i> </li>
<li>This means that my mom can drive and drink     both things together only an adult can do.     <i>I take it your mom isn’t     a member of <a href="http://www.madd.org/home/">MADD</a>.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Entering a no fun zone</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Being immature is like acting like a monkey     or making fart noises with your mouth. </li>
<li>[Adults should be] even keel     (that means they don’t go completely berserk if they don’t get dessert) </li>
<li>You can’t     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="slack off">     slackoff</span>     like you did in middle school. </li>
<li>No grownup is lazy. </li>
<li>No more being babied by mommy. </li>
<li>Movies: OK.<br/> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="T.P.-ing"> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_papering">     Teaping</a></span>: Not OK. </li>
<li>When adults do work like working in the yard,     they can go for hours on end!! Meanwhile we’re in school going insane! </li>
<li>Hitting isn’t going to solve anything     because it’s just going to get you     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="sued">sewed</span>     and thrown into the big house.     <i>As ye sew so shall ye rip.</i> </li>
<li>Jobs can be stressful, boring, and horrible     especially if you don’t like your job. </li>
<li>Her job brings in a     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="luxuriant">luxurient</span>     amount of money. </li>
<li>People who still live with their parents     when they’re 30 years old are not really adults. </li>
<li>Go out get a job get a house and start a family.     Don’t wait or your gonna end up living with your parents! </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>It’s harder than I thought</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Emotions make yourself weak and in life only the strong remain. </li>
<li>I consider one person to be an adult.     <i>Wow, pretty exclusive club.</i> </li>
<li>To be a great adult you should try to resemble Jerry Seinfeld.     <i>Is that the one person?</i> </li>
<li>When I think of the word adult, I think of people like my Dad,     my Mom, my teachers, and random parents I know.     <i>Like, a lottery?</i> </li>
<li>A adult should have a decent car like     a     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="shiny">shiney</span>     Corvette with     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="shiny">shiney</span>     wheels. </li>
<li>Being grown up is very rare and you might only see it     a few times in your life. […]     Being [an adult] requires “the look.”     When you look into an adult’s eyes and see wariness, regret,     stern impassiveness, but most of all, intelligence. </li>
<li>Believe in your yes and the Believing will make it happen,     make you a good leader.     <i>Okay, you lost me at the “Believe in your yes” part.</i> </li>
<li>You need to be social to have friends and have fun as an adult.     Instead of “cowering” in a dark corner of your high school reunion. </li>
<li>You can     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="drive">dive</span>     to and from work. </li>
<li>You have to pay the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="mortgage">morgue</span>. </li>
<li>… independent, responsible, and always goes beyond what     he can do.     <i>He takes on more than he can handle?</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Tautology corner</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>An easy way to tell if someone’s an adult is to see how mature they are. </li>
<li>When you are a child, you have just about no maturity. </li>
<li>There are numerous reasons why I believe     the starting of college is the point you enter college. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Assorted commentary</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, you have to be patient as an adult,     because you might have kids you might not,     but they are always everywhere. </li>
<li>Parents are adults, clowns are adults,     the ice cream man is an adult, most teachers are adults,     and even teachers are adults….     Adults seem to be completely ubiquitous.     <i>About as ubiquitous as children, apparently.</i> </li>
<li>I think that every adult should have a job that gives     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="decent">descent</span>     money.     <i>How about moral decay money? Can I get that, too?</i> </li>
<li>When teenagers think “adult”     most picture a grown up human being that can vote and     drink alcohol until they puke.     <i>I’m having second thoughts on that moral decay money.</i> </li>
<li>Most adults fly off the handle at kids who are obnoxious or     at their stupid boss at their stupid work.     <i>Having issues, are we?</i> </li>
<li>It would be hard to live in a world with immature adults.     <i>Yet somehow we manage.</i> </li>
<li>… kids can get away with mistakes,     because they’re seen as little dogs who don’t know any better. </li>
<li>I’d like to live a low-stress life     for a few more years before society demands my presence.     <i>Enjoy your doghood for a little while longer.</i> </li>
<li>If I am angry at someone or something,     she is always by my side ready to fight.     <i>Is this an adult or an anime character?</i> </li>
<li>Without responsibilities, adults would be just like kids but much taller. </li>
<li>Some people have all the experience in the world,     but they have never     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="analyzed">analized</span>     it.     <i>Anal-ization
 sounds painful.</i> </li>
<li>Do you want to know what an adult is?     Well, I hope so, ‘Cause you’re about to find out! </li>
<li>Now we’re getting off topic so let’s wrap this up. </li>
<li>There are     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="probably">probly</span>     more things to being an adult     but what do I know I just trying to get     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="past">passed</span>     8th grade. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Misspelling corner.</b> I’ve included more context; that may make the game a bit easier. </p>
<ul>
<li>She [Mom] also runs a house with no     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="husband">hunban</span>     on the weekdays. </li>
<li>The thing I don’t like is the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="chores">chorse</span>     that she makes me do. </li>
<li>… doing     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="business">buiesness</span> 24/7. </li>
<li>The     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Maturity">Maturatity</span>     of Friendship </li>
<li>… a great person that     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="reflects">reflex</span>     what a real adult should be like. </li>
<li>You need     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="responsibility">responsibleaty</span>     to cope with the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="basics">basicks</span>     of     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="everyday">every day</span>     adulthood. </li>
<li>There are also some     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="visual">fisual</span> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="signs">singhs</span>     of adults. </li>
<li><span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Those">Thoughs</span>     people have the maturity of an eighth grader. </li>
<li>So the next generation has the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="chance">change</span>     to become a     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="succeeder">secseder</span>     in life. </li>
</ul>
<p> And just so you won’t think all eighth graders are terrible writers: </p>
<ul>
<li>The truth of it all is your house is the central gravitational force,     pulling bits of your life together. </li>
</ul>
