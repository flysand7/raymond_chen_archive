<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">No, we’re not nerds, why do you ask?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last year, to celebrate successful completion of a project milestone, our group went on a “cultural expedition” to a glass-blowing studio where we were to learn about the craft of glass blowing and even do some of it ourselves. (By the way, it was fun.)</p>
<p> One of the glassblowers had been making a lot of little jokes about Frodo and Mount Doom. Working with molten glass does that to a person, I guess. When it came time to break up into smaller groups, each working with a different glassblower, the Tolkein-obsessed glassblower announced, “Okay, let’s do it this way. <i>Lord of the Ring</i> fans on this side of the room, <i>Star Trek</i> on the other.” </p>
<p> After a brief pause, a few of us casually crossed to the other side of the room. </p>
<p> Okay, maybe we’re nerds. You decide. </p>
<p> Hey, at least nobody asked, “What about <i>Harry Potter</i>?” </p>
