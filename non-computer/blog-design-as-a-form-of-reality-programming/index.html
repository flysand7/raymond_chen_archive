<p> On one of our internal blogging aliases, some people were interested in ways of making their blog look spiffier, and the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/max/"> Max</a> team’s blog was pointed out as an example of a “pimped out blog”. This in turn led to exchange of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/archive/2005/01/19/356978.aspx"> tips</a> and <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/stefan_gossner/archive/2005/10/22/412918.aspx"> tricks</a> and someone even proposed an informal  <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/pimp_my_ride/"> Pimp My Blog</a> contest. What next? <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/extrememakeover/"> Extreme Blog Makeover</a>? <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html"> Trading MSN Spaces</a>?</p>
