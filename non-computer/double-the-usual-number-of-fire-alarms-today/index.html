<p> Firefighters hate the Fourth of July, the holiday dedicated to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/04/3678225.aspx"> blowing up stuff</a>, because when amateurs try to blow up stuff, they often blow up stuff they didn’t intend to blow up. One of my friends has a particular unfortunate knack of drawing disasters to his neighborhood. One July 4th, a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. A few years later, he moved to another neighborhood, and the next July 4th,  a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. </p>
<p> The Seattle Fire Department lets you <a href="http://www2.seattle.gov/fire/realtime911/getDatePubTab.asp"> view all the incidents to which they responded</a>, and the year I checked (the year of the second house-burning-down), the Seattle Fire Department responded to twice as many reports on the fourth as they did on the third. </p>
