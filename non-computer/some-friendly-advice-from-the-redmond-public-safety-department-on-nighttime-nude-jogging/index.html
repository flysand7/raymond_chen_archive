<p>Friendly Police Department Tip #001 – Nightly Nude Jogging:  </p>
<p>On Jan 27th at 3:30am, an officer on the south side of a large corporate campus near 15320 NE 40 St observed an unknown male running outside. After seeing nude buttocks illuminated by a street light, she and another officer contacted the jogger, who was wearing nothing but black Sketcher sneakers. Concerned for the cold weather, he was placed in a patrol vehicle.  </p>
<p>When questioned, he stated “he was trying to build up his immune system to fight the cold weather”.  </p>
<p>In case you weren’t aware, nude jogging could be considered indecent exposure. In this instance, he was not charged, as there were no victims. </p>
<p>We do not have pictures to share of this incident. You are welcome. </p>
