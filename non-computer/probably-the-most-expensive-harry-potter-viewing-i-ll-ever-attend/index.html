<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Probably the most expensive Harry Potter viewing I'll ever attend</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last week, I arranged to meet a friend downtown to see <a href="http://www.harrypotterorderofthephoenix.com/"> the latest Harry Potter movie</a>. Traffic across the 520 bridge during the evening rush is always a disaster, so whenever I have to head into the city by myself after work, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/01/3019282.aspx"> I usually take the bus</a>, and today is no exception.
 It is a sunny day, which makes for pleasant weather but horrible traffic. For some reason, traffic is significantly worse on sunny days. Short version: The bus is running behind schedule, and it’s caught up in downtown traffic, so I get off at an earlier stop than I planned and walk/run the rest of the way. It is during this stretch of “run to the next traffic light, cross if possible, else wait for the light” that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EWYB4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000EWYB4"> my clip-on sunglasses</a> must have fallen out of my pocket, because when I reach the theater, they are gone.
 And I didn’t need to have run anyway, because my friend is late, and we miss the 6:40 showing. Fortunately, that is the only glitch in the day. We grab some dinner and catch the next show.
 A few days later, I stop by the eyeglasses store to order a replacement sunglasses clip. $85. That was one expensive Harry Potter movie.</p>
<p> (By the way, I liked the movie.) </p>
