<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Landing the Space Shuttle is hard enough as it is</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was at <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/">The Museum of Flight</a> and was waiting my turn  at the Space Shuttle landing simulator. A six-year-old settled into the control seat, and as the simulation began I heard him ask his father, “Where are the bad guys?”
 I’m pretty sure <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=space+shuttle+door+gunner"> the Space Shuttle doesn’t come with onboard missiles</a>.
 That didn’t stop the kid from pressing the trigger on the joystick a lot, though.</p>
<p> By the way, I cratered the Space Shuttle. </p>
