<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Consider the environment: Do you want a receipt?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dining_at_microsoft/">Microsoft dining services</a> installed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BifSsUoAP9s/">a self-service store</a> in our building. After you complete your transaction, the kiosk reminds you to consider the environment and asks if you want a receipt. </p>
<p>If you say, “No receipt”, it spits out a blank piece of paper. </p>
<p>So I guess technically you didn’t get a receipt. </p>
<p>(The problem has since been fixed.) </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: One of my friends has an ATM at her workplace that reminds you to consider the environment and asks you if you want a receipt. If you say “Yes”, it tells you that the ATM doesn’t print receipts. </p>
