<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond misreads newspaper headlines, episode 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I have a strange tendency to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/04/8355309.aspx"> misread newspaper headlines</a>. This week, I read the headline <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2004346229_apswmworldrecordmens200back.html"> <i>Rogan Sets 200 Back World Record</i></a>, and I thought, “There’s a world record for running 200 meters backward?”
 Well, <a href="http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/backwards-running.html"> actually there is</a>, but this article was actually about the 200 meter backstroke (swimming).</p>
<p> Once I figured that out, I was not confused by the next headline: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2004346258_apswmworldrecordmens100im.html"> <i>Lochte Sets 100 IM World Record</i></a>. </p>
