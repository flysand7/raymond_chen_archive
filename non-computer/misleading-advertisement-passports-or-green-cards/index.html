<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Misleading advertisement: Passports or green cards?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I happened to spot an online advertisement for a company that will <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt003.shtm"> help you enter the lottery for a United States Permanent Resident Card</a>, commonly known as a Green Card (even though they card isn’t green any more). The advertisement was illustrated with a picture of a United States passport. </p>
<p> Um, a Green Card is not the same as a passport, nor does a Green Card authorize you to obtain a passport. Passports are for citizens, not alien permanent residents. </p>
