<p>Many years ago, I called the home of my Chinese-speaking nieces. This was before they started learning English and before I started <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/11/9946369.aspx"> learning their dialect of Chinese</a>. After the call was over, the eldest niece asked, “Who was that on the phone?”
 “That was Uncle Raymond.”
 “Oh, I want to talk to Uncle Raymond!”
 Her mother replied, “That’d be like a chicken talking to a duck.”
 <a href="http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/words/2191/"> <i>A chicken talking to a duck</i></a> is a Chinese idiom referring to <a href="http://kluwerconstructionblog.com/2010/01/07/a-chicken-talking-to-a-duck/"> two people who cannot communicate due to a language barrier</a>.</p>
<p> It seems that ducks are somehow central to the concept of language unintelligibility. Is there a duck-related language idiom in your language? </p>
