<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the international sign for "you left something on the roof of your car"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Occasionally, I’ll spot a car with something on its roof, the driver clearly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/06/21/641665.aspx"> having put it there and forgotten about it</a>. I have just a few seconds to catch the driver’s attention and make some sort of explanatory gesture. What is the international sign for “You left something on your roof”?</p>
