<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">One engineer's interpretation of the Segway as a hybrid vehicle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In a discussion of commuting options (in which I was primarily an observer), the following exchange took place:
 A: I would rather get kicked in the shins every morning than bike up the <a href="http://www.bicycleclimbs.com/ClimbDetail.Aspx?ClimbID=17"> massive hill</a> that sits between my apartment and main campus.
 B: Have you tried an electric bike?
 C: If you’re going to eliminate pedaling, then you may as well go all the way and get a Segway.
 B: Actually, I used to own a Segway. I was floored by the engineering achievement of creating a device that combined the speed benefits of walking with the exercise benefits of driving, and for <i>just</i> the cost of a used Honda!
 Note, of course, that this is just one engineer’s opinion. Some people at Microsoft are <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/the-golden-helmet/"> quite enamored of the Segway device</a>.</p>
<p> <b>Public Service Announcement</b>: Today is Bike to Work Day. A number of <a href="http://www.cbcef.org/btw/btw_stations.html"> commute stations</a> will be set up along popular bike routes in the greater Seattle area to hand out bicycling information and snacks. And if you pass a guy creeping up the 520 hill at around 8:00am, that was probably me. Sorry I forgot to wave. </p>
