<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My least effective Hallowe'en costume</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One year I decided to dress as a nerd for Hallowe’en. I took an old pair of glasses with large lenses, “repaired” it with some masking tape, and combined it with a plaid dress shirt with a pocket protector and courduroy pants that were too short.
 Nobody at work realized I was wearing a costume.
 The best Hallowe’en work costume I saw was someone who came dressed as a Christmas tree. Complete with Christmas lights. She had to make sure to stand near an electrical outlet so she could plug herself in.</p>
<p> <b>I wish I had a picture</b>: One of my friends spotted somebody at a work Hallowe’en party dressed as Bill Gates. But not the Bill Gates of today. He was dressed as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1630529_1380723,00.html"> Bill Gates from the arrest photo</a>. </p>
