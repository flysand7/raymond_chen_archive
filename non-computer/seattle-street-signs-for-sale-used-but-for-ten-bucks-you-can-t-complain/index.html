<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Seattle street signs for sale, used, but for ten bucks you can't complain</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The city of Seattle has begun a nine-year program of upgrading its street signs, and the city has decided to make the old signs available to the public for purchase. When you see the signs on your street replaced, you can go to the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/buy_a_sign.htm"> Buy a Sign</a> page to buy the old one. It looks like signs in average condition are going for $10, whereas signs in below average condition go for $5.
 <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003784544_webstreetsigns11m.html"> Unsold signs will be turned to scrap</a>. Signs for famous streets such as Pike and Pine will be auctioned off on eBay.</p>
<p> If street signs aren’t your thing, you can <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/warehousing/saleitems.htm"> buy old parking meters for $10–$15</a> (listed under “Miscellaneous”). </p>
