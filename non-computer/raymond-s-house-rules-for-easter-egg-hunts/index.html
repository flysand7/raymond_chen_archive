<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond's house rules for Easter Egg Hunts</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One of my colleagues frustrates his family by hiding the eggs for the annual Egg Hunt <i>way too well</i>. “Apparently, drawers and freezers are out of bounds in the traditional egg hunt.” </p>
<p> Here are my house rules for Easter Egg Hunts: </p>
<ul>
<li>All eggs must be hidden within the implied egg-hiding area.     No sneaky outliers. </li>
<li>All eggs must be at least partially     observable by egg-hunters without disturbing anything.     No hiding in drawers or under flowerpots,     or putting them on top of a tall piece of furniture     that a shorter egg-hunter cannot see. </li>
<li>However, you may still have to work to see them.     They might be behind a sofa or placed above eye level.     For example, you might find an egg tucked between the slats     of horizontal blinds. </li>
</ul>
<p> Personally, I like to hide eggs in plain sight. It’s surprising how long it can take somebody to find a yellow egg resting brazenly on the lap of a yellow teddy bear. </p>
