<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A joke for mathematicians: On the Weyl schism</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In one of my mathematics classes, the professor noted (and freely admitted that the joke was not original with him), “There are essentially two groups of mathematicians: Those that have read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl">Weyl</a> and those that have not. And once you enter the first group, you will never be understood by anyone in the second group.” </p>
<p> I guess it’s only funny to mathematicians. </p>
