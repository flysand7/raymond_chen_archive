<p> <i>The Athlete</i><br/>  Crayon and pencil on canvas by Unknown<br/>  30″x40″<br/>  Acquired from trash in Boston by Scott Wilson  </p>
<p>  A startling work,  and one of the largest crayon on canvas pieces  that most people can ever hope to see.  The bulging leg muscles, the black shoes, the white socks, the pink toga,  all help to make this one of the most popular pieces in the MOBA collection.  </p>

<p> <i>The Athlete</i> also happens to be one of the most controversial  works in the MOBA collection.  <a href="http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-8.html">  Read the scandalous details</a>!  </p>
