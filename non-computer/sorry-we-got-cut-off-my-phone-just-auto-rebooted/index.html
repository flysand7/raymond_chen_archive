<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sorry we got cut off, my phone just auto-rebooted</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I was on the phone when the connection suddenly cut out. I looked at the my phone display and it said, <i>Auto-restart in 7 seconds</i>. The seconds counted down, and then the phone rebooted, and after about ten more seconds, it was back in business, acting like nothing was wrong. (Except that it just terminated a phone call without warning, but hey, who’s keeping track?)
 Sometimes I think phones are getting too smart for their own good.</p>
<p> <b>Historical note</b>: This entry was written over four years ago, and the model of IP phone in question has long since been replaced.  </p>
