<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of seventh graders: Success</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Seventh grade students (ages 12 to 13, roughly) were asked to write an essay on what success is and how you know  when you’ve achieved it. The assignment was given under standardized test conditions: 90 minutes with nothing but pencil and paper, with an additional hour available upon request. (In practice, few students ask for the extra hour.)
 Remember, these are only the funny sentences/excerpts. Do not assume that all students write like this.</p>
<p> <b>On the nature of success</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>     Success is not a very difficult thing to think about,     but if you explain it, it can be hard to explain. </li>
<li>     Stride to Success </li>
<li>     Success is not the end, but the beginning. </li>
<li>     As the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="saying">say</span>     goes,     the only time you will find sucess before work is in the dictionary. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Recognizing success</b> </p>

<li>     Success means you have a jolly time. </li>
<li>     It’s a feel good feeling. </li>
<li>     To me success is a goal a feeling of     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="proudness?">prowness</span>.     that tells me that this is a goal of your limits not an age limit. </li>
<li>     Sucess is when you had the opportunity to do something     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="great">greatful</span>. </li>
<li>     Success is shaking your butt in their face that you are better than them. </li>
<li>     Another meaning for success is just winning.     Winning is what most people think success is,     but winning is only half the meaning of success.     Winning is just winning.     <i>Yeah, but at least you can shake your butt in their face,     and that’s worth something.</i> </li>
<li>     Success is trying your best…     I have a question. do teachers ever have success? </li>
