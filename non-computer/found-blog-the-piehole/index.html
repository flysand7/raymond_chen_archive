<p>I have no idea <a href="http://liscious.net/piehole/"> who this person is</a>, but she’s all attitude all the time. Like <a href="http://www.liscious.net/piehole/archives/2005_10.php#006252"> this entry from October 18, 2005 when Jennifer was recovering from a foot injury</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Men love a girl who can’t run away quickly</b> </p>
<p> I got “wooey!”-ed by a garbage man on my way back to the office from lunch today… Because I’m so HAWT hobbling down the street. He could not resist my hobbling! I am hobbleicious! Sssssssss! * </p>
<p> And just so you know, being followed down the street by a garbage truck with someone screaming “YEAH BABY!” and “what’s your phone number?” is TOTALLY CLASSY! </p>
<p> * This is the sound of me sizzling! </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It’s the asterisk that’s the icing on the cake. </p>
