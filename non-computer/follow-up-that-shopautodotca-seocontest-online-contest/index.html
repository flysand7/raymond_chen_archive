<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Follow-up: That shopautodotca seocontest online contest</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>So I didn’t win the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/08/3150724.aspx"> shopautodotca seocontest</a> search engine optimization contest, so I decided to check on how the actual winners were faring. After all, one of the winners was supposed to become the company’s SEO manager.
 The top prize winners <a href="http://shopautodotcaseocontest.org/"> in the Google category</a> and <a href="http://shopautodotcaseo.blogspot.com/"> in the MSN category</a> have both complained that they haven’t received their prizes yet and have threatened to file a fraud claim. (<a href="http://seocontest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6544">Dead link to forum</a>.) The <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/shopautodotca"> top prize winner in the Yahoo category</a> hasn’t said anything one way or the other.
 Meanwhile, <a href="http://shopauto.ca/forum/" rel="nofollow"> the forum hosted by the contest organizers</a> was emptied of all messages, rendering it a breeding ground for message board spam. (It was subsequently taken down late last year.)</p>
<p> I suspect that’s the last I’ll hear of this contest; I don’t anticipate any resolution to emerge. </p>
