<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The King County Council race gets even stranger</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/03/4712713.aspx"> I told you it was going to get weird</a>. </p>
<p> In the month since my last report, there have been a few developments in the county council race between an accused drunk (the incumbent) and a fringe candidate (the challenger). </p>
<ul>
<li>     The incumbent admitted     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003895009_hague21m.html">     having approved biographical information in which a bachelor’s degree     was claimed</a>,     shortly after previously vehemently denying that any such     résumé inflation had taken place. </li>
<li>     The incumbent     filed a campaign disclosure notice     revealing a $50,000 contribution to the campaign.     The challenger then filed a complaint on the grounds that     the contribution exceeded the legal limit.     The incumbent then claimed     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003903446_hague26m.html">     that the notice was filed in error and no such contribution was made</a>. </li>
<li>     The challenger     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/election2007/2003906450_pope27m.html">     will not have the support of the party he nominally belongs to</a>. </li>
<li>     The incumbent     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/election2007/2003906447_hague27m.html">     agreed to pay a $8,000 fine</a>     for campaign finance violations. </li>
<li>     The incumbent’s pretrial hearing for drunk driving     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003917421_webhague01.html">     has been delayed until after the election</a>. </li>
<li>     The incumbent’s party     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003930983_elexotherpope07m.html">     tries to draw attention away from their candidate for a little while</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/"> <i>The Seattle Times</i></a> tries to summarize the state of the race with a series of articles: </p>
