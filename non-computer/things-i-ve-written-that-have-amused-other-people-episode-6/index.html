<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Things I've written that have amused other people: Episode 6</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On an internal discussion group, somebody decided to quote one of my blog entries.
 <a href="http://jim.medding.net/"> Jim Medding</a> was amused by my response: <a href="http://jim.medding.net/blog/2008/06/20/raymond-speaks/"> Bloggers are just idiots with a Web site</a>.</p>
<p> (My blog was dug up in order to refute a claim, even though the blog entry applied to a situation different from the one under discussion.) </p>
