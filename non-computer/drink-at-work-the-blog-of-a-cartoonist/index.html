<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Drink at work: The blog of a cartoonist</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Francesco (“Ces”) Marciuliano is the author of the comic strip <a href="http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/sforth/about.htm"> Sally Forth</a>. In his blog, <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/blog.html"> Drink at Work</a> he expounds on whatever tickles his fancy. (Warning: Includes strong language, adult situations, and political views.) Sure, <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005_04_01_archive.html#111358765927960249"> the stories on writing a cartoon are fun</a>, especially when he <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/05/concerns-for-kitty-questions-for-me.html"> responds to feedback from readers</a>, and he also has a long series of articles titled Comic Strip Writing 101 (example: <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/comic-strip-writing-101-its-not-all.html"> Comic Strip Writing 101: It’s Not All Pabst and Vicodin</a>), but that’s not the best part. No, the best part is the conversations with his father. Here’s an except from <a href="http://www.drinkatwork.com/2005/04/conversations-with-dad-2.html"> Conversation number two</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> Marciulianos live much longer than average folks! Look at your Grandpa! He would still be alive today if he hadn’t died in that hospital. </p>
<p> <strong>Ces:</strong> What? </p>
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> Y’know, from that spill he took…when he had to go to the hospital. I bet if he didn’t fall he would still be around today. </p>
<p> <strong>Ces:</strong> At age 102? </p>
<p> <strong>Dad:</strong> See? That’s what I’m talking about. Marciulianos live a long time. </p>
