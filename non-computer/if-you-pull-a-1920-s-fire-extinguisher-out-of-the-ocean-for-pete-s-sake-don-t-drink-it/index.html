<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you pull a 1920's fire extinguisher out of the ocean, for pete's sake don't drink it!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer is a fascinating source of information. He appeared again on <a href="http://www.kuow.org/">my local public radio station</a> to discuss issues related to garbage floating in the ocean. For example, at the 5:05 mark, he reminds us that, <a href="http://www.kuow.org/weekday.asp?Archive=04-15"> if you pull a 1920’s fire extinguisher out of the ocean, you shouldn’t drink it</a>. </p>
<p> Other fascinating facts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ten-pound bowling balls float. </li>
<li>Sneakers float upside-down, and the tongue acts as a rudder, resulting in left-footed sneakers and right-footed sneakers washing up on different shores. (Beachcombers from different-footed shores occasionally meet up to try to assemble a pair.) </li>
<li>There are 1939 different species of plastic ducks. </li>
</ul>
