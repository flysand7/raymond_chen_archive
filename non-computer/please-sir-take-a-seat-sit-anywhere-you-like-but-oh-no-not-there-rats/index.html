<p>Here’s a joke:
 Question: Where does Bill Gates sit?
 Answer: Anywhere he wants.
 (Naturally, substitute the chairman of your company for Bill Gates.)
 I was told this story by a manager who was preparing a demo for Bill Gates. Bill was going to pay a visit to the offices of one particular project which was still under development and be taken on a tour, stopping by offices to see how things are going and get demos of different parts of the project. This manager was in charge of one of the features and naturally was called upon to prepare a little demo.
 Chance favors the prepared, and our manager took great care to make sure the demo would go off without a hitch.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Before Bill came, I spent some time figuring out the agenda and wrote a list of bullet points on a notepad. I ‘cleaned’ my desk and left the notepad on the desk to my right so I easily take a quick peek if needed. Ran the demos a couple of times to make sure they were still working. Everything was ready. </p>
<p> A few hours later, it was demo time. Bill came to my office, and after some introductions, he decided to sit down. </p>
<p> At my desk. </p>
<p> On my right. </p>
<p> Right on top of my notepad. </p>
<p> I screamed inside my head. This is the sort of thing that happens only in the movies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Fortunately, the demo went well and there was no need to consult the notepad.</p>
<p> But still. </p>
