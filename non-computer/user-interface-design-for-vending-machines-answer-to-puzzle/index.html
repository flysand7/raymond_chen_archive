<p> <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/12/351398.aspx"> Last time, we ended a discussion of vending machine design with a short puzzle</a>: What problems do you see with numbering the products from 1 to 99? </p>
<p> I’m not saying that these are the only possible answers, but they are ones that came to mind when I thought about it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Product codes less than 10 would be ambiguous. Is a “3” a request for product number 3, or is the user just being slow at entering “32”? Solving this by adding a leading zero will not work because people are in the habit of ignoring leading zeros. </li>
<li>Product codes should not coincide with product prices. If there is a bag of cookies that costs 75 cents, users are likely to type “75” when they want the cookies, even though the product code for the cookies is 23. </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/">Ilya Birman</a> was the first to point out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/12/351398.aspx#351447"> the “bounce-effect” problem</a>, thereby ruling out product codes like 11, 22, and 33. </p>
