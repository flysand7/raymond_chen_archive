<p>Last Saturday, my friends and I were heading for a subway station in Brooklyn and found ourselves behind a man and a woman both dressed in Santa Claus outfits. They were kind enough to wave us onto the train with a “hurry, hurry!”, and we made it on board just as the subway doors closed.
 And then we discovered that we were on a subway train <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/gallery/0750,0750santacon,78558,3.html?pic=4&amp;total=23"> filled with people dressed as Santa Claus</a>, noisy but well-behaved. What parallel universe had we mistakenly stepped into? Was there some subway dress code announcement we had missed?
 Nope. The announcement we missed was for the 2007 <a href="http://www.santacon.com/nyc/">New York City SantaCon</a>. (Here they are swarming <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/gallery/0750,0750santacon,78558,3.html?pic=12&amp;total=23"> Grand Central Terminal</a>.)</p>
<p> <a href="http://santarchy.com/santacon-2007/"> Many cities are having their SantaCon tomorrow</a>, including <a href="http://seattlecacophony.blogspot.com/2007/12/santa-route.html"> Seattle</a>, so if you see roving bands of red-suited revelers, you’ll at least know what’s going on. </p>
