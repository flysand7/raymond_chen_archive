<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Today is Swedish tax day</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Of course, in Sweden, every day is tax day.
  By now, it’s too late to fill out your tax form,  which  <a href="http://www.skatteverket.se/">  the Swedish tax agency</a> permits you to file  on paper, via Internet, over the phone, or even via SMS.</p>
<p>  They even have what I wish  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">the US tax agency</a> had:  <a href="http://www.skatteverket.se/servicetjanster/skatteutrakning/ink1/skatteutrakning04ink1.html">  An online tax form calculator</a>.  </p>
