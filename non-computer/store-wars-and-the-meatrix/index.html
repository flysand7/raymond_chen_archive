<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Store Wars and the Meatrix</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.storewars.org/"> Store Wars</a> is a propaganda video for the Organic Trade Association, starring vegetables and bad puns. (“Darth Tater” indeed.) Yes, it’s a propaganda video, but at least it’s an entertaining propaganda video. </p>
<p> The same company also created <a href="http://www.themeatrix.com/"> The Meatrix</a>, in conjunction with (deep breath now) the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment. The difference is that The Meatrix isn’t funny. </p>
