<p> It’s easy to distribute points evenly across a flat surface, but doing so over a curved surface is a much more complicated problem. <a href="http://www.ogre.nu/sphere.htm"> Even spheres are hard</a>. <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/people/bios/ssimon.html"> NPR’s Scott Simon</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4223425"> interviews mathematician Ed Saff</a> who with colleague Doug Hardin has developed a new method of attacking this complex problem. <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/news/releases?id=15880"> Press release from Vanderbilt University</a></p>
<p>. You can also download the paper (in PDF form) from Dr. Saff’s home page, if you think you’re smart enough to understand it. (Don’t ask me for help. I have two degrees in mathematics and was in over my head by halfway through page 2. I couldn’t even make it out of the <strong>Introduction</strong>.) </p>
