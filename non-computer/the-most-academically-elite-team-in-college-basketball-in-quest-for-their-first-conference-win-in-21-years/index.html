<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The most academically elite team in college basketball, in quest for their first conference win in 21 years</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://www.quantumhoops.com/"> <i>Quantum Hoops</i></a> is a new documentary which follows the college basketball program at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/"> California Institute of Technology</a> through its 2007–2008 season. The school is regularly honored as one of the finest academic colleges in the United States. Their basketball team, on the other hand, is not as well-honored. It has won two conference games in the last 35 years. Their last victory was 240 games ago.
 The elite college basketball teams dream of winning the NCAA tournament, or at least winning their conference championship. Lesser teams dream of posting a winning record. These guys just want to win a game. <i>Just one game</i>.
 <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/index.php/2008/03/21/film-review-quantum-hoops/"> <i>Only a Game</i> reviews the film</a> and <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/index.php/2008/03/21/college-hoops-heats-up-losing-at-cal-tech-and-the-blue-jays-taking-flight-32208/#jvflv6"> interviews the filmmaker</a>. I love the soaring soundtrack as former players recount one of their two “recent” victories, breaking a 99-game losing streak. That happened in 1979. “We won a game. A real game.”</p>
<p> The film has a limited run in selected cities. In Seattle, it plays at the <a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Seattle/MetroCinemas.htm"> <i>Metro Cinemas</i></a> March 28 through April 4. Don’t spoil it for me. </p>
