<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Possessed: A documentary about hoarding</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I found <a href="https://www.vimeo.com/603058">Possessed</a>, a short documentary on hoarders, fascinating because I teeter on the brink of hoarding myself and have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx"> fight it</a>. Some days I am more successful than others. Notice how coherently the subjects talk about their obsession. They know it’s pathological, but they can’t stop themselves. </p>
<p> I was able to beat my hoarding of cardboard boxes (“Hey, it’d be a waste to toss these cardboard boxes into the recycle bin; I could re-use it someday, like maybe if I have to mail a package or something”) when a friend of mine was moving and needed cardboard boxes to pack up his things. I gladly handed over my stash of cardboard boxes, with the instructions that when he was finished, the cardboard boxes were his problem. That solved two problems. I was able to get rid of my cardboard boxes with a clear conscience, and my friend got a bunch of moving boxes. </p>
