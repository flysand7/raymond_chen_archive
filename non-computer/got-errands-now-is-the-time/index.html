<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Got errands? Now is the time</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This upcoming Sunday is the Super Bowl, the championship game for a sport played only in the United States.¹ </p>
<p>The entire country stops doing anything when the game is on. This makes it a perfect time to get out and run your errands, because the streets will be completely empty. </p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/data/tools/traffic/maps/archive/ArchiveMapDisplay.aspx?PickDate=2014-02-02%2004:00:PM&amp;MapName=SysVert">this traffic map</a> at the kickoff of the 2014 Super Bowl. For fun, you can go backward in time in 10-minute increments and watch the traffic slowly die out as the start of the game approaches. </p>
<p>If you’re a photographer, it’s a good time to go take pictures of public places, because they will all be deserted. </p>
<p>It’s also a good time to go to Costco, though you should wait until the game has started. It takes time for all the people getting last-minute party supplies to drain out. </p>
<p>¹ Well, Canada has their own variant. They’re so cute, those Canadians. </p>
