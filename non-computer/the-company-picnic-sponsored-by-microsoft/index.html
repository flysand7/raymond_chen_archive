<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The company picnic, sponsored by Microsoft</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  Robert Scoble  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/07/31.html#a8040">  blogs from the Microsoft company picnic</a>.  Although he writes,  “Microsoft holds a picnic for its employees every year,”  this suggests that the picnic is organized by Microsoft.  It isn’t.   </p>
<p>  The company picnic is run by a professional company picnic  company.  They also do  <a href="http://www.alaskasworld.com/news/2004/07/15_PicnicReminder.asp">  the Alaska Airlines company picnic</a>,  and probably those of many  <a href="http://www.gocitykids.com/calendar/?area=182&amp;month=7&amp;day=10#68042">  other organizations</a> who don’t put their  picnic information on the public Internet.  Wander down to Mountain Meadows Farm any weekend during the summer  and you’re likely to see a picnic or other group event under way.  </p>
