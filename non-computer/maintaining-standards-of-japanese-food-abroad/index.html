<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Maintaining standards of Japanese food abroad</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> They’ve been nicknamed the <i>sushi police</i>. In response to horror stories from Japanese travelling abroad and being shocked by what passes for Japanese food outside their borders, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/12/07/PM200612077.html"> the Japanese agriculture ministry is developing certification standards for restaurants abroad that want to call themselves Japanese</a>. Their results are supposed to be out at the end of this month with inspections to begin in April. </p>
<p> You can’t say that the Japanese aren’t looking out for the psyche of their citizens abroad. (But if they’ve made the effort to travel to another country, shouldn’t they be eating the local food instead of Japanese food?) </p>
