<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Seattle Improbable Show (2004)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>An overflow crowd attended <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2004/02/improbable_show.html">The Seattle Improbable Show</a>. It was, as expected, a rollicking good time.
 Mark Abrahams emceed and gave presentations, one on <a href="http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2003"> each of last year’s Ig Nobel Prize winners</a>, another chronicling various stages in the development of <a href="http://www.onf.ca/grizzly/">Project Grizzly</a>. Other speakers were allotted five minutes (strictly and amusingly enforced) to expound on their chosen subjects, my favorite of which was <a href="http://www.smallparty.org/yoram/">Yoram Bauman</a>‘s thought-provoking <a href="http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i2/mankiw.html"> Translation of Mankiw’s Ten Principles of Economics</a>. (Don’t miss footnote 3!)</p>
<p> Note to self: Next time, bring more paper. (For making and throwing paper airplanes, of course.) I brought only two this time. Need more. </p>
