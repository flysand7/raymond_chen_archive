<p> <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/List_of_advertising_slogans#Beverages"> It’s not just orange juice for breakfast any more</a>. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003524373_soda14.html"> Soft drinks are making inroads</a> into the world traditionally dominated by milk, orange juice, coffee, and tea. According to the article, over one in seven people order a soft drink to accompany their breakfast. (Among people who eat at home, the rate is 2.4%.) </p>
<p> If this trend continues, can Doritos for breakfast be far behind? </p>
