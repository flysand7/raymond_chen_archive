<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dead man running</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The plight of the legally dead (but physically alive) in India  has been taken up by – of course – a legally dead man.  And now  <a href="http://ww.smashits.com/index.cfm?Page=Video&amp;SubPage=STFSnoopView&amp;BBID=1236">  he’s running for public office</a>.  Though apparently  <a href="http://www1.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/586927.cms">  this isn’t the first time</a>.
  (People are usually declared dead by conniving relatives  who want to claim their inheritance prematurely.)</p>
<p>  I wish him luck.  If  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.missouri/">  it works in Missouri</a>  it can work in India.  </p>
