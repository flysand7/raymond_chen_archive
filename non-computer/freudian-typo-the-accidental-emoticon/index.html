<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Freudian typo: The accidental emoticon</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Some time ago, I ran across the following Freudian typo in a mail thread discussing plans for the project after Milestone 3, commonly abbreviated M3. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I’d like to talk with you about your plans for this area after &lt;3. </p></blockquote>
<p> On the US-English keyboard layout, the M and comma keys are adjacent, and a shifted comma is a less-than sign. A simple off-by-one-key typo resulted in M3 turning into <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/21/evolution-of-the-hea.html"> an emoticon</a>. </p>
