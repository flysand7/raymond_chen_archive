<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Man, this housing downturn is hitting everyone, follow-up</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in 2008, I remarked on a house for sale on Mercer Island, described in the original listing as <a href="http://bing.com/search?q=22799+square+feet+in+square+meters">22,000 square-foot</a>, having five bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two swimming pools, and a place to park your <a href="http://bing.com/search?q=140+feet+in+meters">140-foot</a> yacht. At the time, it was <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=20463">marked down to $35 million from $40 million</a>. </p>
<p>The house was eventually sold in 2010 for <a href="https://www.redfin.com/WA/Mercer-Island/1631-Roanoke-Way-98040/home/254053">$12 million</a>, less than a third of the original asking price. Here’s <a href="http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/49034472_zpid/">another view</a>. (Note also that the official records don’t agree with what was claimed in the listing. As a general rule, never believe anything a real estate agent tells you.) </p>
