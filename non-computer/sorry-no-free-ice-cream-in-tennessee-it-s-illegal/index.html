<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sorry, no free ice cream in Tennessee; it's illegal</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<blockquote class="q"><p>  It seems that  <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/government/archives/04/04/49561858.shtml?Element_ID=49561858">  giving away ice cream has been illegal in Tennessee since 1957</a>,  when state legislators were trying to combat alleged  unfair trade practices by the dairy industry.    Upon its being alerted to the existence of this law,  the state Senate and House unanimously passed a bill to repeal the law,  sending it to the governor for signature.
  Aha, but it’s not as simple as you think.  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  The bill as written would have eliminated an entire section of  state law covering unfair trade practices and frozen desserts.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://tennessean.com/local/archives/04/04/49604470.shtml?Element_ID=49604470">  The bill was withdrawn</a>  after some lawmakers got calls from dairy company officials  who feared the bill was too broad.  </p>

<p>  It is unclear whether an amended bill will pass in time for  Baskin-Robbins’ free cone day, planned for April 28.</p>
