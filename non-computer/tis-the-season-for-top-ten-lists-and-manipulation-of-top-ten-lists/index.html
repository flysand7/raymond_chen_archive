<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">'Tis the season for top ten lists, and manipulation of top ten lists</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2005/12/12/PM200512125.html"> Marketplace radio reported on the sub-industry of top ten lists</a>, specifically the lists intended to be used as gift guides. Marketing companies drool over these lists, since placement on them can mean a tremendous boost in sales, and they’re anxious to do whatever it takes to get on the list. For example, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> was a relatively unknown title until the American Booksellers Assocation placed it on their own “best picks” list.
 In the story, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/">c|net</a> comes off looking good, standing their ethical ground against marketers looking for an endorsement. <i>The Today Show</i> doesn’t fare as well.</p>
