<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happens when you tell a Millennial to take pictures of a party</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was a speaker at an internal Microsoft conference for field technical people, I offered my attendee party ticket to my team because I was unable to attend myself. My instructions to the person who got the ticket were “Take pictures.” In retrospect, I should have been more specific, because he is a Millennial, and the pictures we got were of his plates of food. </p>
