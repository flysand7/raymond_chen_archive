<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Book me the next flight to Tokyo, no wait, the second flight</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I know someone who has a brother who works in Taipei, Taiwan. He travels to Japan often on business, and one day he needed to fly to Tokyo on short notice. He instructed his assistant to book the next flight from Taipei to Tokyo.
 <a href="http://evakitty.evaair.com/">This is what he got</a>. (Warning: Contains strange music.)
 That’s right. His assistant booked him on <a href="http://www.evaair.com/html/b2c/english/eva/News/2005/new20050521.htm"> Hello Kitty Air</a>, initially a daily flight from Taipei to Fukuoka, but soon extended to <a href="http://www.evaair.com/html/b2c/english/eva/News/2005/News_110401.htm"> a second run to Tokyo</a>. <a href="http://rojaks.blogspot.com/2006/09/hello-kitty-craze-hello-kitty-airline.html"> Everything on this plane is Hello Kitty</a>. The paint scheme, the flight attendants, the boarding passes, the luggage tags, the chopsticks, the sugar packets, the in-flight meals, even the <a href="http://static.flickr.com/50/136667098_1b9940e98e_m.jpg"> barf bags</a>. I’m told that most people who take this flight are women who are way too into this Hello Kitty thing.
 Anyway, he learned his lesson. Now when he has an urgent meeting in Tokyo, he tells his assistant, “Book me the next flight to Tokyo, but <i>not</i> the Hello Kitty one.”
 This story made me wonder what a “guy version” of the Hello Kitty plane would be. When I brought it up with my colleagues, we quickly agreed that it would be a <i>Star Wars</i>-themed airplane. But what would be the in-flight movie? (And <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/04/60761/"> which Leia</a> will the female flight attendants be dressed as?)</p>
