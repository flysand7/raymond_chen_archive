<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Internal training video on expense reports contains inconsistency: Alert the media!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was watching an internal training video on proper handling of expense reports. The narrator says, “This is a small expense report, and everything looks good.” </p>
<p>But everything does not look good. The expense report says <i>Meals: USD $14</i>, but the receipt is for a $153 flat-screen monitor. </p>
<p>Was this a test? I’m not sure. </p>
