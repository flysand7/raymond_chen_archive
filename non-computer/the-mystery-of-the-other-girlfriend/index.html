<p> Many of my married friends have “other girlfriends”, or at least that’s how their wives tease them. </p>
<ul>
<li>Friend 1’s “other girlfriend” is a male colleague with whom     he often goes to dinner when working late. </li>
<li>Friend 2’s “other girlfriend” is his boat. </li>
<li>Friend 3’s “other girlfriend” is     a     “<a href="http://ihearditonnpr.blogspot.com/2008/07/cell-etiquette.html">regularly changing set of small electronic devices</a>.” </li>
</ul>
<p> I don’t know for certain, but if you ask my wife, she’ll probably say that my “other girlfriend” is this Web site. </p>
