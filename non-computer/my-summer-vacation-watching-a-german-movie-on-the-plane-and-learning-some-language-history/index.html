<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My summer vacation: Watching a German movie on the plane and learning some language history</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I travel on an airplane, I like to watch movies in German because it gives me a chance to practice my aural decoding, which has always been a weak spot of mine.</p>
<p>One movie was <i>Der Vorname</i>, which was put in the “Comedy” category, but it’s a comedy like the Alan Alda movie <i>The Four Seasons</i> is a comedy. <i>I.e.</i>, not actually a comedy.</p>
<p>I tried to redeem my bad choice by watching a German-dubbed <i>Shrek</i>. I noticed that Shrek and Princess Fiona address each other as <i>ihr</i>, which is the second-person familiar plural. Why is that?</p>
<p>A colleague of mine explained that <i>ihr</i> is an archaic form of the second person pronoun. It’s used in fairy tales, so the movie uses it to capture the fairy-tale feeling.</p>
<p>However, Shrek and Donkey address each other as <i>du</i> (second person informal), not <i>ihr</i>.</p>
<p>My colleague thought about it some more and realized that he had made a mistake. “<i>Ihr</i> is the archaic second person <i>formal</i>, corresponding to modern <i>Sie</i>. And as a general rule, nobody is formal with a donkey.”</p>
