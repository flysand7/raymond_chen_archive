<p>My friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> ::Wendy::</a> has many circles of friends, and several of them converged at the <a href="http://elephantcastle.com/content/locations/seattle"> Elephant and Castle Pub</a> in Seattle last week <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2007/10/31/repatriating-to-reading-berkshire/"> for her send-off party</a>, resulting in a night-long game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram"> Venn Diagram</a> as you tried to work out which groups intersected how.
 I got to meet in person some of ::Wendy::’s blogger friends, including <a href="http://liscious.net/piehole/"> Jennifer</a> (aka “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/02/488164.aspx">Piehole</a>“) and <a href="http://www.dharmajunkie.com/"> LaCroix</a> (not her real name), the person who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/24/1521926.aspx"> tipped me off to Yaktrax</a> earlier this year. Jennifer in real life is pretty much exactly like her blog persona: boistrous and hilariously outrageous. LaCroix was a surprise: Although her writing appears methodical and subdued, in person, she’s intensely energetic and charismatic. Once you start talking with her, you somehow just <i>want</i> to be her friend. It’s no wonder that she has her own <a href="http://www.dharmajunkie.com/2007/11/01/jeudi-le-1-novembre/"> Cafeteria Boyfriends</a>.</p>
<p> At some point during the evening, I mentioned the movie <a href="http://www.darkonthemovie.com/"><i>Darkon</i></a>, a documentary on the <a href="http://www.darkon.org/"> Darkon Wargaming Club</a>, a band of Live Action Role Playing aficionados, known perhaps pejoratively as <i>larpers</i>. We were all fascinated by the idea of the movie (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2177830/">Grady Hendrix of <i>Slate</i> calls it a “must-see”</a>), but alas it doesn’t appear to be showing in the Seattle area. We’ll just have to wait for it to show up in the video rental stores. </p>
