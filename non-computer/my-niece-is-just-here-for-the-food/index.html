<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My niece is just here for the food</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I asked my niece (a preschooler at the time) if anything interested happened in school today.</p>
<p>“We went to the pumpkin patch.”</p>
<p>I asked her, “What did you do there?”</p>
<p>Her answer: “I ate noodles for lunch.”</p>
<p>She is apparently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1584790830?tag=tholneth-20"> just there for the food</a>.</p>
