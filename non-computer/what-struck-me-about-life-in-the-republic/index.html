<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What struck me about life in the Republic</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When people asked me for my reaction to the most recent Star Wars movie, I replied that what struck me most was that the Republic doesn’t appear to have any building codes. There are these platforms several hundred meters above the ground with <strong>no railings</strong>. For example, Padmé Amidala’s fancy apartment has a front porch far above the ground. Consider: You’re carrying a load of packages to the car, the kids are running around, you turn around to yell at one of them, miss a step, and over the rim you go. How many people fall to their deaths in that galaxy?</p>
