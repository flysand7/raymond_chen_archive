<p> In celebration of the impending return of Battlestar Galactica to the airwaves, I refer to you <a href="http://www.anysoldier.com/WhereToSend/ContactsContinued/JohnBell.cfm"> the blog of Major John M. Bell</a>, one of our brave Marines stationed in Iraq. His entry from 26 Oct 2005 gives some real-world examples of military call signs and how they were chosen.</p>
