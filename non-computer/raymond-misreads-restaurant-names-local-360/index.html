<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond misreads restaurant names: Local 360</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Okay, maybe this time I’m misreading it on purpose, but when I see the name of popular new restaurant <a href="http://www.local360.org/"> Local 360</a>, I think, “That doesn’t look all that low-calorie to me. I bet their dishes have more than 360 calories.” </p>
<p> Or maybe it’s “We serve high-calorie foods five days a year. Congratulations, you happen to have picked those five days.” </p>
