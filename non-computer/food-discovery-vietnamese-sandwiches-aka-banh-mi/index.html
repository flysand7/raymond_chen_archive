<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Food discovery: Vietnamese sandwiches, aka bánh mì</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some friends came down to visit from <a href="http://www.vancouver.ca/"> Vancouver</a> to take advantage of the favorable exchange rate, and when the topic of lunch arose, one of them suggested Vietnamese sandwiches.
 “What are Vietnamese sandwiches?” I asked.
 “Okay, that settles it. We’re having Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch,” was the response.
 We went to the generically-named <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/nws_rev.cfm?id=436"> Seattle Deli</a> and ordered our sandwiches. (I had the chicken.)
 For less than three dollars I was rewarded with a wonderful sandwich. Crisp French bread around a collection of vegetables, some spicy, some pickled, some fresh, but all crispy, contrasting with the softness of the promised meat.</p>
<p> It’s a fantastic dining experience. Too bad there are no Vietnamese sandwich shops near work. </p>
