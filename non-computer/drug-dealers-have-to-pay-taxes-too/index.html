<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Drug dealers have to pay taxes too.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  In the state of Kansas,  “<a href="http://www.ksrevenue.org/perstaxtypesdrug.htm">The fact that dealing marijuana and controlled substances  is illegal does not exempt it from taxation</a>.  Therefore drug dealers are required by law to purchase drug tax stamps.”</p>
