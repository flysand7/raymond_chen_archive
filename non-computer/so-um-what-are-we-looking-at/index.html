<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">So, um, what are we looking at?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some of <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180330-01/?p=98405">my relatives from Vancouver, British Columbia</a> enjoy going on cruises. During one cruise along the Alaska coast, they found a large number of passengers gathered on the viewing deck and gazing toward the shore in awe and amazement. </p>
<p>My relatives looked out toward shore but couldn’t identify what it was that drew everyone’s attention. Was something interesting happening on shore? Was there a whale in the ocean? </p>
<p>After failing to identify the source of the awe and amazement, one of them asked one of the awe-filled passengers, “So, um, what are we looking at?” </p>
<p>The other passenger replied, “Why, the snow-covered mountains, of course. Aren’t they gorgeous?” </p>
<p>My relatives were less impressed, because they live in Vancouver, where <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/top-vancouver-winter-events-activities-3371064">a view of snow-covered mountains is what you get every winter</a>. </p>
<p>They surmised that most of the people on the cruise are from parts of the world where they don’t get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwGxvOviWM">a view of snow-capped mountains on their daily commute</a>. </p>
<p>I’ll be on my first cruise next week. The blog will be running on autopilot. This means that I won’t be around to approve comments manually. Only comments from validated users who have previously commented on the blog will get through automatically. </p>
