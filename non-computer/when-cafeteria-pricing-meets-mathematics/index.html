<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When cafeteria pricing meets mathematics</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Prices in the Microsoft cafeteria are often illogical.
  For example, a “special sandwich” costs $4.25.  A piece of whole fruit costs $0.50.  But a “special sandwich with a piece of whole fruit” costs $4.95.
  If you’re not careful, the cashier will ring it up as a  “special sandwich with a piece of whole fruit” instead of as  a “special sandwich” and a “piece of whole fruit”.
  (I think they eventually fixed this after enough people complained.)
  As another example,  name-brand bottled water is available in the cafeteria.  You can get a 20-ounce bottle for $0.99 or a one-liter bottle  for $1.99.
  One liter is a little under 34 ounces.  You’re actually better off buying two 20-ounce bottles than one  one-liter bottle.  Get more water and save a penny.</p>
