<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nearly 20 percent of daily smokers say they exercise three or more times a week</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Several months ago, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/"> <i>The Seattle Times</i></a> ran a story on <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002369582_gymsmokers10.html"> people who smoke and also work out</a>. In the article, personal trainer Will Baldyga compares it to other dissonant behavior such as pigging out on ice cream after a workout. I have to admit that on rare occasions, I lapse into such behavior (“justifying” bad eating habits with exercise), but on the whole, I manage to keep myself honest.</p>
