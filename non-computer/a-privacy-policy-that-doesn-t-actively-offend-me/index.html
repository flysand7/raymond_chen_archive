<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A privacy policy that doesn't actively offend me</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve ranted before about privacy policies and how they don’t  actually protect your privacy.  (All they’re required to do is  disclose the policy; there is no requirement that the policy must  be any good.)
  Today I read  <a href="http://www.metlife.com/Applications/Corporate/WPS/CDA/PageGenerator/0,1674,P560,00.html">  MetLife’s privacy policy</a> and found to my surprise  that it does not actively offend me.  It’s written in plain English,  it’s well-organized,  and it actually explains <strong>and limits the scope of</strong>  each exception.</p>
<p>  I have noticed  how the word “terrorism” has turned into a “magic word” of late.  Anything distasteful you want to do, just say you’re doing it  to combat “terrorism” and people will give you the green light.  </p>
