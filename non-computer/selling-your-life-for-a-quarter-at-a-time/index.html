<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Selling your life for a quarter at a time</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> A year and a half ago, I stumbled across the essay <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/timbarcz/archive/2006/10/24/151609.aspx"> <i>Selling Your Life for a Quarter at a Time</i></a> by <a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/timbarcz/"> Tim Barcz</a> and found it quietly poignant. (Unfortunately, the spammers also found the essay and decided to fill it with garbage links. So much for poignant.) </p>
<p> I tried to come up with a catchy tagline for this entry, but nothing worked. Coming up with something snappy would just be a disservice. </p>
