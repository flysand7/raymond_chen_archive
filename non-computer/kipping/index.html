<p>Apparently that’s the term for knitting in public.
  The New York Times covered  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/27/technology/circuits/27shop.html">  the online knitting community</a>.  I wasn’t aware of the  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/knitlist/">Yahoo knitlist group</a>;  I may have to go check it out.</p>
<p>  (The NYT article also mentions the yarn  <a href="http://www.straw.com/cpy/yarns/fizzcard.html">  Fizz</a>, which I have used, but I much prefer  <a href="http://www.straw.com/cpy/yarns/splashcard.html">  Splash</a>, a totally knock-your-socks-off novelty yarn.  Incorporate Splash into a scarf and you’ve got a friend for life.)  </p>
