<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dinner at the Herbfarm in Woodinville</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As part of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/04/435286.aspx"> going-away festivities for my friend</a>, a group of us went to <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>, the local restaurant referenced in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/04/435288.aspx"> Clue I of Puzzle #3</a>.</p>
<p> The restaurant is nestled in the Sammamish Valley, right next to the <a href="http://www.willowslodge.com/">Willows Lodge</a> resort and its restaurant, <a href="http://www.willowslodge.com/barkingfrog/"> The Barking Frog</a>. Less than a kilometer down the road is the <a href="http://www.ste-michelle.com/"> Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery</a>. All the high-falutin’ wine-snob destinations in one convenient location. (Right behind is the <a href="http://www.redhook.com/"> Redhook Brewery</a>, if you tire of the whole urbane ambience and just want a beer and a sandwich.) </p>
<p> Actually, the word “restaurant” doesn’t do the Herbfarm justice. It’s really a “total dining experience”. The evening begins at 4pm with a tour of the herb garden. After heading inside, you are introduced to the evening’s menu and the restaurant staff. (This restaurant has a staff mushroom forager!) Once the introductions are complete, the nine-course five-hour meal begins. </p>
<p> For posterity, I record the menu below. </p>

<p> Between the duck and salad courses, we stepped outside to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sherrygrindeland/2002348121_grin25e.html"> feed the pigs</a>. </p>
<p> The preliminary tour of the herb garden primed me to appreciate the extensive range of herbs employed in the various dishes. (We also learned herb trivia—daylilies are edible, as are zucchini and chive blossoms. I found this part most fascinating, learning about herbs and how the various elements were chosen for the dishes to come.) The garden salad, it seemed, didn’t have two leaves from the same plant! </p>
<p> If you’re considering paying the Herbfarm a visit, be warned: You need to make reservations months in advance, and the evening will set you back a pretty penny. </p>
<p> And we did pay the bill before we left. </p>
