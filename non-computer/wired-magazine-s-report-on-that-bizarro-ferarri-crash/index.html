<p> Say what you want about blogs, there’s still room in the world for engaging journalism, such as <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/gizmondo.html"> Randall Sullivan’s report on that bizarro Ferarri crash</a> that started out as a spectacular event but turned out merely to be the entry into a much more complex and intriguing world. (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/05/gizmondos_spectacula.html">via BoingBoing</a>.) </p>
