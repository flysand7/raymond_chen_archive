<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does Mulan speak Chinese?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One day, my daughter was at her pretend kitchen pretending to prepare a party for all the Disney princesses. (Yes, this was during her Disney princess phase.) The pretend phone pretend-rang, and she handed it to me. “It’s Mulan.” </p>
<p>I dug deep into my brain and pulled together enough Mandarin Chinese words to form a reply: “你好. 你來嗎?” I asked. (“Hello. Are you coming?”) </p>
<p>My daughter corrected me. </p>
<p>“Mulan doesn’t speak Chinese.” </p>
<p>Some time later, we took a trip to Disneyland, and my daughter had the opportunity to meet Mulan. My wife discreetly asked Mulan, “Do you speak Chinese?” </p>
<p>Mulan quietly replied, “Sorry, no.” </p>
<p>So my daughter was right. </p>
<p>To be fair, Belle probably doesn’t speak French,¹ Jasmine probably doesn’t speak Arabic, and Pocahontas probably doesn’t speak Algonquian. </p>
<p>May is Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. </p>
<p>¹ Well, unless you go to Disneyland Paris. </p>
