<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">On being attacked by a sidewalk</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Yesterday, I was attacked by a sidewalk.</p>
<p> I was cycling from work to a friend’s house for dinner and was northbound in the shoulder on 172nd Ave NE in Redmond. As I reached <a href="http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=47.723987%7C-122.110175&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=19&amp;v=1"> the intersection with NE 138th St.</a>, I was momentarily distracted, perhaps by my water bottle, I forget. This lapse of attention resulted in my failing to notice that north of NE 138th St., what used to be the shoulder becomes completely consumed by a sidewalk which leaps into the road out of nowhere. </p>
<p> A sidewalk with a sharp curb. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the curb curves into position, so instead of running headfirst into a curb, my wheels were merely nudged to the left about <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=60+cm+in+ft"> sixty centimeters</a>. Still, it was more than enough to throw me flying off the seat onto the ground at around <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=30kph+in+mph"> 30kph</a>. Luckily, my rear end took the brunt of the impact, with minor scraping on my right leg and right arm. </p>
<p> I’m writing this to serve as a warning to anybody who cycles along 172nd Ave NE: There a sidewalk lying in wait at NE 138th St. </p>
<p> (After dinner, we watched the most recent episode of <i><a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a></i> then camped in the backyard to observe the <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/22jul_perseids2005.htm"> Perseid meteor shower</a>. I spotted only three meteors. I’m not a very good meteor-spotter—I glimpsed only three—what with my smudgy glasses and poor night vision.) </p>
