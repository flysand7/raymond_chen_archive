<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The etymology of the word “traffic light”</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some languages are very creative with their term for those red/green thingies that control (or at least try to control) the flow of vehicular traffic.</p>

<p> Swedish proves the least surprising in this respect (from a US English point of view), using the same term as US English. South African English is the funniest with their “robot”. (It makes sense in its own way:  It’s a device that replaces a policeman directing traffic.) In my experience, South African English is full of cute little words like this. I imagine that Germans find Swiss German similarly quaint. </p>
<p> The German word “Ampel” has the most interesting history of the set. <a href="http://www.linse.uni-essen.de/kuntermund_loewenmaul/etymologie_html/woerter/ampel/ampel.htm"> It originally entered the German language as “ampulla”, an urn filled with paraffin and used as a lamp</a> (cognate to English “amphora”). You can easily imagine how this word gradually evolved into the term for a traffic signal. </p>
<p> The Mandarin Chinese term for traffic light is to me quite enlightening as well. The Taiwanese term for traffic light is “hòng lí dūn”, and I assumed it was just a made-up word unconnected with any other words. (In the same way that the English word “elephant” just is; it’s not built out of other English words like “ele” and “phant”.) Since the Taiwanese words for “red”, “green” and “light” are nothing like the Mandarin Chinese words, I was unable to make the connection.  Now I see its etymology and it makes sense. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, I haven’t been making the progress that I’d have liked on Mandarin. Even though my meager knowledge of Taiwanese should’ve given me a head start (since about 80% of Taiwanese words are to varying degrees cognate with Mandarin Chinese), it doesn’t help with the grammar at all because I don’t understand Taiwanese grammar consciously. The words just make sense and I don’t know why. </p>
<p> Which is too bad because the grammatical structure of Mandarin Chinese is radically different from that of Germanic languages, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/01/170857.aspx"> with which I have had a long-time fascination</a>. </p>
