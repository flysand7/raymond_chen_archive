<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Making a reservation at the Asteroid and interrupting a cookie-bake</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some months ago, I wanted to make a reservation at my favorite Seattle restaurant for special occasions: the  <a href="http://www.asteroidcafe.com/"> Asteroid Cafe</a>. (Asteroid trivia: Their original Wallingford location was so small, you had to go into the kitchen to use the rest room. When they moved to Fremont, they made a special point of putting the rest room in the kitchen for old times’ sake.)
 One evening, I called to make a reservation, and since they aren’t open on Sundays, I was taken off guard when a live human being answered. I said that I was expecting the answering machine since I thought they were closed. The person who answered explained, “Well, we <i>are</i> closed. I’m not really supposed to be here. I’m just baking some cookies.” And then he took my reservation.</p>
<p> I’m assuming he actually works there and wasn’t some guy who broke into the restaurant to bake cookies. </p>
