<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can you pass "Coaching Principles and Strategies of Basketball"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=1750279">  From ESPN</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>    If you were enrolled in Jim Harrick Jr.’s Coaching Principles  and Strategies of Basketball course at the University of Georgia  in the fall of 2001,  you were drilled on such subjects as basketball,  basketball and even basketball.  </p>
<p>  How many points for a field goal?  What league does Georgia compete in?  What color are the uniforms?  These are just a few of the piercing questions Harrick inflicted on his class.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/quiz?event_id=600">  Take the test and see if you pass</a>.  </p>

<p>  I want to know how you can possibly grade a multiple choice question  that asks you to express an <strong>opinion</strong> (question 20).  An essay question I can see; you get graded on how well you justify  your opinion. But a multiple choice question?</p>
<p>  “Wrong. That’s not your opinion.”  </p>
