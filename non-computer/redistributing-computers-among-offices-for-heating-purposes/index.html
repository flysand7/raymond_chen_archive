<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Redistributing computers among offices for heating purposes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I joked about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/14/1075573.aspx"> people who rearrange computers in their house during the winter in order to use them as space heaters</a>.</p>
<p> Turns out this happens a lot at Microsoft. One of my friends said that one of his coworkers used a small heater in her office to keep warm. On the other hand, his office always ran warm because of all the computers in it. They hit upon a simple solution to both problems: “Now she’s using a 12 core/24 thread space heater that’s a lot quieter than her old one.” </p>
<p> At one point in time, I had a large number of computers in my office, including an Itanium prototype. (You knew it was a prototype because it contained <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/21/472296.aspx"> Engineering Styrofoam</a>.) The thing generated a lot of heat. My friend across the hall, on the other hand, had a cold office. Solution: With some help from colleagues, we moved the Itanium across the hall. Two problems solved. </p>
