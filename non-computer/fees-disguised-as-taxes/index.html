<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Fees disguised as taxes</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It has become customary in the telecommunications industry  to quote a low price and then add half as much to it  in “fees”.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>    Regulatory Programs Fee. It sure sounds like a government tax.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4972632/">  It isn’t</a>.  </p>

<p>  There’s been a new round of official-sounding line items on  telephone bills, which are really just ways for telephone companies  to raise rates while still being able to quote a low price.
  <a href="http://investor.verizon.com/2003annual/proxy/proxy16.shtml">  The issue was raised as a shareholder proposal in Verizon’s  2004 proxy statement</a>.  The proposal starts out sounding very much like a crackpot  (perhaps because the proposer <strong>is</strong> a crackpot),  and the logic is rather twisted, but the underlying theme is  still there:  Price hikes disguised as official-sounding fees.</p>
<p>  How I long for the European rule that the quoted price must  accurately represent the actual amount of money you will pay,  including taxes and fees.  None of this “quote a low price and then add a ton of mandatory  surcharges” nonsense.  </p>
