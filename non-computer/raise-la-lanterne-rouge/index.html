<p>Sure, everybody knows that Floyd Landis won this year’s Tour de France. But what about the guy who came in last? While the race leader wears the <i>maillot jaune</i> (yellow jersey), the person at the bottom of the pack is saddled with the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/07/23/sports/LANTERN.php"> <i>lanterne rouge</i></a> (red lantern), after the lamp that hangs on the back of a train. This year’s “winner” is Wim Vansevenant, who at least appears to be a good sport about it.</p>

<p> (It also amuses me that there’s even a <a href="http://tdflr.blogspot.com/"> Tour de France Lanterne Rouge blog</a> which keeps track of who is “pulling up the rear” throughout the race.)</p>
<p> Now, mind you, at least he finished the race, which is more than can be said for <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2006/TDF/LIVE/us/2000/abandons.html"> the thirty-some-odd people who dropped out for one reason or another</a>. All of whose water bottles I am not worthy to carry, of course. </p>
