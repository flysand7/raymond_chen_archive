<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The sociology of the mobile phone</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It has become obvious by now that the mobile phone has changed the way people interact. These two papers were forwaded to me by a colleague, whose summary I am shamelessly lifting from heavily.</p>
<p> First is a short paper titled <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/003495.html"> Exploring the implications for social identity of the new sociology of the mobile phone</a>. </p>
<p> The much more fascinating (and much longer) one is <a href="http://www.motorola.com/mot/doc/0/234_MotDoc.pdf"> The Effects of Mobile Telephones on Social and Individual Life</a> [PDF]. Read about Flight, Suspension and Persistence—the three ways people deal with incoming calls. Learn how to tell an Innie from an Outie. Set up an Approximeeting. Are you a swift, an owl, a dove, a sparrow, a starling, or a peacock? Pick up some UK mobile phone lingo: </p>
<ul>
<li>“Gooseberry call”: calling someone during their date to get a progress report. </li>
<li>“Shagbile”: the mobile phone your partner doesn’t know about, used for affairs. </li>
<li>“Sad”: derogatory term for people who show off their phones. Enormous ritualization surrounds this. </li>
</ul>
<p> “Shagbile” is the best. So <a href="http://www.austinpowers.com/">Austin Powers</a>. </p>
