<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Silly Alexa trick: Speaking French with a horrible American accent</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Here’s a sily Alexa trick.</p>
<p>Use the Alexa app to set the language to something other than English, say, French.</p>
<p>Ask Alexa a question. It will respond in French.</p>
<p>Use the Alexa app to set the language to US-English.</p>
<p>Say, “Alexa, repeat that.”</p>
<p>Alexa will repeat the French response, but using the US-English speech synthesizer, which means it will be speaking French words with a horrible American accent.</p>
