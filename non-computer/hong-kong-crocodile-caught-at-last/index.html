<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hong Kong crocodile caught at last.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  After over half a year of eluding experts,  <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040610-0502-hongkong-crocodile.html">  the Hong Kong crocodile was caught at last</a>.  What amused me was that the article said that the creature  had eluded an expert crocodile hunter from Australia  named…  <a href="http://www.planetark.com/envpicstory.cfm/newsid/22876">  John Lever</a>?  (Curiously,  <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1100988.htm">  in this article</a>, he is given credit for capturing the croc.)  </p>
<p>  Not the self-proclaimed Crocodile Hunter  <a href="http://www.crocodilehunter.com/">Steve Irwin</a>?  Where’s his PR department when he needs them?  </p>
