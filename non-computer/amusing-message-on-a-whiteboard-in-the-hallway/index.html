<p> It is common to see whiteboards mounted in hallways. Sometimes they have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/28/540579.aspx"> official purposes</a>; other times they are just placed for the convenience of hallway conversations or impromptu meetings. </p>
<p> One of the hallways near my office has a very large whiteboard, completely blank, save for one note clearly written in the corner. </p>
