<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Another chance to see Elvis take on a mummy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>For those  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/09/54828.aspx">  in the Seattle area who missed it last year</a>,  <a href="http://www.fremontoutdoormovies.com">The Fremont  Outdoor Cinema</a> is screening  <i><a href="http://www.bubbahotep.com/">Bubba Ho-Tep</a></i>  on Friday, July 9th.
  Go see it. You won’t be disappointed.  Assuming what you were expecting to see was Elvis fighting a mummy.  With the help of JFK. In a wheelchair.</p>
<p>  If you were expecting something else, then okay maybe you’ll be  disappointed after all.  </p>
