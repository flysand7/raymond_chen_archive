<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why am I ignoring my second monitor? A case study in working from home.</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/03/05/covid-19-microsoft-hourly-workers/">working from home</a>, which is probably what many software developers are doing right now. My usual work area had been a desk in the corner of the family room, because I didn’t normally do a lot of work from home. Now that everybody is home, that location in the corner of a busy room wasn’t particularly conducive to working without interruption.</p>
<p>I ended up setting up my temporary home office in our spare bedroom, using a large folding table as a “desk”. I bought a second monitor so I could get something that more closely resembled my usual work environment, but I found that I rarely used the second monitor. Eventually, I figured out why.</p>
<p>My two monitors at home were arranged with the main monitor directly in front of me, and the secondary monitor to the right.</p>
<p>At work, I have three monitors on my desk. I use the center and left monitors a lot, but the monitor on the right is connected to a machine I don’t use much, and I got into the habit of ignoring the monitor on the right.</p>
<p>I moved the secondary monitor from the right side of my main monitor to the left. Now I use both of my monitors.</p>
<p>It’s weird how these little unconscious things have such a large effect.</p>
