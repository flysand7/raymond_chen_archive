<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to pwn an unattended laptop, according to Humans</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues who pays attention to this sort of thing pointed out that Season 3 Episode 5 of the television documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_(TV_series)"><i>Humans</i></a> demonstrates how you can take over an unattended laptop:</p>

<p>Apparently hackers have <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140528-01/?p=873"> graduated from Notepad</a> and are now using PowerShell.</p>
<p>My colleague was pleasantly surprised that this screen shot is reasonably accurate! The first line allows all scripts to run, and the second line runs a script that from the output appears to be updating firewall rules.</p>
<p>The “Exploit installed” is just showing off.</p>
