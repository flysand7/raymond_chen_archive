<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What do rocket scientists say when they want to say that something isn’t hard?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>An idiom that entered the English language (or at least the U.S. dialect of it) in the latter half of the twentieth century is “it’s not rocket science”, meaning that something is not hard.</p>
<p>But what do rocket scientists say when they want to say that something isn’t hard?</p>
<p>I actually ask this question of a mechanical engineer who works on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch">Sea Launch</a> project. The answer: “Heck, most rocket science isn’t rocket science.”</p>
