<p>When <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/12/04/essay_contest_what_i.html"> I read</a> that <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/">Ecologist Magazine</a> is co-sponsoring <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/offer2.asp"> an essay contest on the topic <i>What is Humanity’s worst Invention?</i></a>, it reminded me of a related essay exercise assigned to seventh-graders by a friend of mine. The students (typically thirteen years of age) were given the topic <i>What is humanity’s greatest invention or discovery?</i> Here are some of the greatest inventions and discoveries of all time, according to these students:</p>
