<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Redmond Derby Days 2007 this weekend</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Every summer, the city of Redmond stages <a href="http://www.redmond.gov/recreationarts/derbydays/"> Derby Days</a>, an annual celebration of… I’m not sure what. But what it does mean is that roads will be closed in the downtown Redmond area, so if you need to get around, you’ll have to plan ahead.
 Several years ago, one of my colleagues asked a City of Redmond employee, “What <i>is</i> Derby Days?” He received this very perceptive reply: “Derby Days is a very important cultural event… for the people who organize it.”</p>
<p> My friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> :: Wendy ::</a> remarks on the apparent <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2006/07/09/cargo-pants-parade/"> dress code</a> which accompanies the parade that honors… I’m not sure what. Not even the people participating in the parade were able to tell her what Derby Days actually was. </p>
