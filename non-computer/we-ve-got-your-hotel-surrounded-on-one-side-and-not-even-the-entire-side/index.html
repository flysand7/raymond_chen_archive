<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">We’ve got your hotel surrounded (on one side) (and not even the entire side)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A local hotel advertises itself like so:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><a href="http://www.orbitz.com/hotel/United_States--WA/Bellevue/Larkspur_Landing_Seattle_-_Bellevue.h81054/"> Surrounding the hotel</a> are popular Seattle attractions such as Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, Safeco Park, home of baseball’s Seattle Mariners, and Qwest Field, home of football’s Seattle Seahawks, all just a short drive away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, first, it’s Safeco Field, not Safeco Park. Mind you, I’ve <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/26/679045.aspx"> misspelled <i>Qwest Field</i></a> in the past, so maybe I shouldn’t complain. But let’s look at those Seattle attractions which “surround” the hotel: <iframe height="900" src="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCP&amp;cp=47.598982~-122.240444&amp;style=r&amp;lvl=11&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;sp=Point.rxwmz74tp354_Hotel____~Point.ry1f7b4t4c3k_Pike%20Place%20Market____~Point.ry326t4t3t1k_Space%20Needle____~Point.rxyj7s4t52tm_Safeco%20Field____~Point.rxz96y4t53vz_Qwest%20Field____~Polygon.ry317x4t3vbw_rxwmj04tp3yj_rxyjwp4t53ky_ry317x4t3vbw_Surrounded%3F____%230000FF_%23008000_2pt_Single_Solid_rxzd6w4t9pz3_&amp;encType=1" width="900"> </iframe></p>
<p>They all lie in the same direction and subtend a total of twelve degrees of arc. This is a sense of the word “surround” I was previously unfamiliar with. Let’s hope these marketing folks never end up working for the police department.</p>
<p>“Before we continue, we need to surround the building.”</p>
<p>— <i>No problem, Chief, I’ve already got that.</i></p>
<p>And then the bad guys sneak out the back door.</p>
<p>— <i>I don’t understand how they got away. We had the place surrounded!</i></p>
