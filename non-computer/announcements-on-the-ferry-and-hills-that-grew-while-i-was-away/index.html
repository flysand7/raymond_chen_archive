<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Announcements on the ferry, and hills that grew while I was away</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This weekend is the annual <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/chilly/index.cfm"> Chilly Hilly</a> bike ride, an early wake-up call to bicyclists in the Seattle area to get their act together and hit the road.</p>
<p> Last year, I joined <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004199188_chillyhilly25m.html"> my 2999 closest friends up and down the hills of Bainbridge Island</a>. Unfortunately, the hills had <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/08/448970.aspx"> grown taller</a> in the two years since my last ride. </p>
<p> There was an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636824.aspx"> announcement on the ferry</a>. It went something like this: “Your attention please. There is a bicycle on the car deck that has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/watson_house/3301394737/"> fallen over onto its side</a>. Repeat: A bicycle has fallen onto its side.” </p>
<p> It took a few seconds for the joke to sink in with all the people on the ferry, but after a short while, the passenger deck was chuckling. </p>
