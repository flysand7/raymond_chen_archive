<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sorry, my kitchen is on fire</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The other night my phone rang just as I discovered that I overheated  my pan and the oil was starting to burn.  I rushed to the phone, thinking  it’s the people I had invited to dinner, but no, it was some telemarketer.
  “Hello, is this Mr. Chen?”
  “Sorry, can’t talk now, my kitchen is on fire.”
  “Oh my God, sorry!” &lt;click&gt;
  I’ll have to remember to use that again in the future.</p>
<p>  (P.S., there were no actual flames and I managed to open enough  windows so my smoke detector didn’t go off.)  </p>
