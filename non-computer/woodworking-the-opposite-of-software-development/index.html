<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Woodworking, the opposite of software development</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>While <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">waiting for the BoltBus</a>, I met a former software developer, who said that he’s now a carpenter. Specifically, he makes furniture out of wood, so a more precise term for his type of work would be something like <i>woodworking</i>. </p>
<p>He says he quit software because customers would keep making change requests on short notice, even for features he was pretty sure they’d never actually use. </p>
<p>I asked him if his new job has the same problem. </p>
<p>He said, no, it’s the opposite. </p>
<p>Nobody asks for new features for their bench or table or whatever. They show him a picture of a 100-year-old table and say “Make me that.” </p>
<p>Sometimes, a former customer will call and say, “Hey, remember me? You made a table for me three years ago.” Do they want to modify the table? Nope. “Can you make one exactly like it for my sister?” </p>
