<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to hide privacy violations in a privacy disclosure statement, part 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It seems that nearly every privacy statement somebody sends me doesn’t actually protect my privacy. They start out saying all sorts of great things, like</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Company X is committed to maintaining the privacy of its customers. </p></blockquote>
<p> After the section listing what information they collect, there’s the section describing who they will disclose it to. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We do not share non-public personal information with outside parties except as permitted by law… </p></blockquote>
<p> Oh, gee, thanks. Your policy is not to do anything illegal. And you need a privacy statement for this? </p>
<p> Actually, it’s worse, The full sentence goes like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We do not share non-public personal information with outside parties except as permitted by law or as is necessary to service customer accounts. </p></blockquote>
<p> Notice the “or” rather than the “and”. That means that they reserve the right to <i>violate the law</i> if it is necessary to provide service to a customer. </p>
<p> And then, if they haven’t already promised to protect nothing, they throw this in: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Additionally, except as prohibited by law, we may disclose non-public personal information to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. </p></blockquote>
<p> Translation: We will sell your personal information to other companies for marketing purposes to the maximum extent permitted by law. </p>
<p> But that’s okay, because they restate their commitment to privacy in a final italicized paragraph. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <i>Protecting the confidentiality of your non-public personal information remains a priority for us, and is one way in which we respond to the trust you have placed in our organization.</i> </p></blockquote>
<p> Because if you put it in italics, you really really mean it. Even if the other stuff contradicts it. </p>
