<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Perhaps I like the phrase “withered hand” a bit too much</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Sure, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/23/473443.aspx"> I like saying “withered hand”</a>, but Google took this a bit too far and made me <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=withered+hand"> the top hit for the phrase <code>withered hand</code></a>, making me <a href="http://www.newsoftheodd.com/article1012.html"> more popular than Jesus</a> with respect to that phrase, at least for now. I apologize to all the people looking for the <a href="http://bartleby.com/108/40/12.html#S57"> Miracle of the Withered Hand</a>. Fortunately, <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=withered+hand"> MSN Search</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=withered+hand"> Yahoo</a> were not fooled.</p>
