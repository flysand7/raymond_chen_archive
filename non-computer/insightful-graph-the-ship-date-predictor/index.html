<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Insightful graph: The ship date predictor</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The best graphs are the ones that require no explanation. You are just told what the <i>x</i>– and <i>y</i>-axes represent, and the answer just jumps out at you. <span id="more-91751"></span></p>
<p>One of the greatest graphs I’ve seen at Microsoft is this one that a colleague of mine put together as Windows 95 was nearing completion. He took each email message from management that changed the Windows 95 RTM date (also known as the ship date) and plotted it on a chart. The <i>x</i>-axis is the date the statement was made and the <i>y</i>-axis is number of days remaining in the project, according to the email. The dotted line is a linear least-squares fit, and the green star is the actual ship date (<!-- backref: Hazy memories of the Windows 95 ship party -->July 14, 1995). </p>

<p>What’s so amazing about this chart is that the linear approximation predicts the actual ship date with very high accuracy. The slope of the line is 0.43%, which means that if you took the predicted “days remaining before we ship” and multiplied it by around 2.3, you’d be pretty close to the actual ship date. </p>
<p>In other words, management fairly consistently underestimated the number of days until RTM by a factor of 2.3. (Another way of looking at it is that the development team consistently underreported the number of days to completion to management by a factor of 2.3.) </p>
<p><b>Bonus amusement</b> </p>
<p>Here is a pull quote from each of the announcements, lightly edited. </p>

<p>Today marks the 20th anniversary of the public release of Windows 95. Just one more year, and you’ll be old enough to buy a drink!¹ </p>
<p><b>Bonus reading</b>: <a href="https://gartenberg.wordpress.com/2009/02/17/start-me-up-again/">Start Me Up (again)</a>: Brad Chase (who ran the worldwide launch of Windows 95) tells the story of how <i>Start Me Up</i> became the anthem for Windows 95, and addresses <a href="http://win95anniversary.com/">the legend that that it cost $14 million</a> to license the song.

<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/party-like-its-1995-microsoft-vets-to-host-epic-party-to-celebrate-20-year-anniversary-of-windows-95/">The ticket price for the Windows 95 team reunion party is $47.50</a>. This seems like an odd number, but it makes more sense when you buy two tickets (one for you, and one for your partner). </p>
