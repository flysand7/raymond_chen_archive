<p> If everything went according to plan, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/18/409206.aspx"> the trip to the hole in the Arctic Ocean</a> should have completed a few months ago. I went to <a href="http://www.voyagehollowearth.com/"> the web site</a> to see what they found, only to discover that it’s been postponed another year, to June 26, 2007. </p>
<p> This is clearly the handiwork of the world government  attempting to suppress the release of information they have all held in secret for decades. All their attempts to prevent the discovery of the polar opening only serves to confirm its existence! </p>
