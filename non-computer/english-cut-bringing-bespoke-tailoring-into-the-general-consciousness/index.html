<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">English Cut: Bringing bespoke tailoring into the general consciousness</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Thomas Mahon’s <a href="http://www.englishcut.com/">English Cut</a> is a glimpse into the world of bespoke tailoring, a world I was completely unaware of prior to his web site. I was particularly fascinated by his description of <a href="http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000126.html"> how to recognise the work of Anderson &amp; Sheppard</a> by inspecting the pockets. It is this attention to detail that really makes the difference between good and great. I like to think that every now and then one of my own essays, say on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/25/54582.aspx"> the fine details of scroll bars</a> or on supporting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/04/447654.aspx"> double-clicked radio buttons</a>, also helped someone raise the quality of their software from good to great. </p>
<p> Mr. Mahon’s partner in crime is <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh Macleod</a> who points out that <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001943.html"> the blog is the main driver of new business</a>. Remember that the next time somebody tries to start a marketing blog. Mr. Mahon’s web site shares his knowledge with us, teaching us about his craft, and does so in a conversationally engaging manner. <a href="http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000032.html"> Even when he’s selling himself</a>, he does so while praising his competition. </p>
