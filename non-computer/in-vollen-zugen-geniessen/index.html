<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">In vollen Zügen genießen</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my friends bought me a souvenir one one of his trips to Germany. It is a beer mug from <a href="http://www.bayerischer-bahnhof.de/">Bayerischer Bahnhof</a>, a restaurant and brewery at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_Bayerischer_Bahnhof"> Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof</a>. The mug carries the brewery’s slogan <i>In vollen Zügen genießen</i>, which is a German idiom meaning “to enjoy to the fullest.” Literally, “<span lang="de">Das Leben in vollen Zügen genießen</span>” means “to enjoy life in full gulps”, the idea being that instead of sipping your way through life, you’re taking huge gulps of it.
 The slogan is a pun, though, for the Bayerischer Bahnhof, because the word <i>Zug</i> also means train. They come from the root <i>ziehen</i> which means “to pull”. (Compare the English word <i>draught</i>, which has a similar duality.)
 Therefore, the saying “<span lang="de">Das Leben in vollen Zügen genießen</span>” could also be interpreted as saying “Enjoy life in crowded trains.”</p>
<p> Which is why it’s the slogan of a brewery in a train station. </p>
