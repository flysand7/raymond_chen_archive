<p>In my discussion of the effect of ASLR on DLL rebasing, I wondered how vtables and other function pointers were handled in position-independent code. Commenter kantos replied, “<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170120-00/?p=95225#comment-1281115">It appears from a cursory google search that</a>…” </p>
<p>I wanted to find out more, so I did some searching but couldn’t find anything, so I asked for help with that cursory search. </p>
<p>“It was GCC PIC C++ which didn’t get me to the answer directly, I had to go through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/967055/332733">the SO question that was the second result</a> to get to <a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">this document</a> by Ulrich Drepper, and then skim through until page 29 where it describes what’s done in the virtual table case.” </p>
<p>Okay, so I had to issue a Google search, click the <i>second</i> result, then go to the <i>second answer</i> (not the accepted answer), click a link enigmatically called “the document referenced by 0x6adb015”, download the resulting 45-page PDF, and read through to page 29. </p>
<p>This doesn’t strike me as a “cursory search”. </p>
