<p> When Australian Channel Seven <a href="http://finance.news.com.au/story/0,10166,12861823-462,00.html"> aired a blank screen for 41 minutes</a> [<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/23.84.html#subj1">indirect report</a>], you’d think its competition would pick up some viewers. But it didn’t. </p>

<p> But the glitch did not result in a ratings boost for public broadcaster SBS, with figures showing viewers preferred Seven’s blank screen.  </p>
<p> To Seven’s astonishment more than 900,000 viewers stayed tuned to the network after screens went blank 38 minutes into the nail-biting episode. “Around a million Australians hung in there for us and we thank them for their commitment,” Seven Sydney spokesman Simon Francis said last night.  </p>
