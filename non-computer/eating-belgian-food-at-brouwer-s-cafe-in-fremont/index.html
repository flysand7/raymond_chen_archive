<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Eating Belgian food at Brouwer's Cafe in Fremont</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Last year, some friends and I went for dinner at <a href="http://www.brouwerscafe.com/"> Brouwer’s Café</a>, a <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/edb_vd.cfm?c=c&amp;ven=25945&amp;&amp;s=nws"> Belgian pub/restaurant</a> in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. The menu is pub food, which means that everything comes with <i><a href="http://www.belgianfries.com/">frites</a></i> and a choice of several dipping sauces, none of which is ketchup. One of my friends spent some formative years of her life in the Netherlands, so she was familiar with <i>frites</i> and asked for curry ketchup. Unfortunately, they didn’t have it. (But I know a great German deli that does carry curry ketchup…) </p>
<p> I tried to stay somewhat healthy with a salad, but the <i>croque monsieur</i> pretty much cancelled out any fat-avoidance forgoing the <i>frites</i> may have offered. As we munched on our <i>frites</i>, I wondered how the Belgians managed to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2003/10/21/livin_large/"> eat such profoundly fatty food</a> and not blimp up like Americans. My friends revealed the secret in one word: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2127949/"> nicotine</a>. </p>
