<p> <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=martha26m&amp;date=20060226"> Martha Stewart was in town this past weekend signing her book on baking</a>. Although I’m a Martha fan, I didn’t attend the signing because I already have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/24/359498.aspx"> a really awesome book on baking</a>. I’ve listed below some of the ground rules for the book signing, mixed in with some stuff I just plain made up. Your mission is to pick out which of these rules are for real and which are fake. </p>
<ol>
<li>Martha Stewart will sign only the baking book.     No other books or memorabilia. </li>
<li>Do not make eye contact with Martha Stewart. </li>
<li>Do not speak to Martha Stewart unless spoken to. </li>
<li>Do not ask Martha to write anything other than her name. </li>
<li>Do not take pictures of Martha Stewart. </li>
<li>If Martha Stewart becomes angry, curl up into a ball     and cover your head with your hands. </li>
</ol>
