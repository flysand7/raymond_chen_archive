<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The mystery of the stalker dental hygienist</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues remarked that every time he visits the dentist, the hygienist seems to have stalker-level knowledge of his life.</p>
<p>“How did your son do at the chess tournament?”</p>
<p>“Have you decided to do anything fun with your brother’s family when they come to visit?”</p>
<p>“Did your wife’s performance go well?”</p>
<p>Eventually, he realized why the hygienist knew so much about his life: Because his wife’s dentist schedule matches his, but she goes in a month earlier.</p>
<p>The hygienist chats with his wife during her visit, which means that when he goes in a few weeks later, the hygienist asks follow-up questions.</p>
