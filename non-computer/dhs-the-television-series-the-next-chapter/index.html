<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">DHS: The Television Series – the next chapter</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Okay, so first there was the story about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/10/87248.aspx"> the planned DHS television series</a>. And then there was the follow-up reporting that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/29/475299.aspx"> the whole thing was an investment scam</a> and there was no such show after all. Following through on the story, it looks like the ringleader behind the scam has been <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/27/woman-sentenced-to-prison-over-reality-series-scam/"> sentenced to one year in prison</a> and an accomplice to five years probation and $250 a month in restitution. The TV Squad article says <i>retribution</i>, which would be strange if true. <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292007/tv/reality_tv_scam_ends_in_jail_time_tv_.htm"> But it’s not</a>. (Read the announcements of the accomplice’s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2006/023.html"> indictment</a> and <a href="http://losangeles.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/la041906usa.htm"> guilty plea</a>.) At $250 a month, it’s going to take a long time to repay the court-ordered $3.4 million in restitution.</p>
<p> Two years later, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge who imposed the one-year sentence for the ringleader <a href="http://cbs2.com/local/Joseph.Medawar.scheme.2.677842.html"> failed to follow sentencing guidelines</a> (which call for a minimum of 57 months), and ordered that he be sentenced again. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the accomplice appears to have violated the terms of her probation, so she was <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/25/local/me-homeland25"> sentenced to ten days in jail</a>. </p>
<p> Who knows what’ll happen next? This story may never reach its final chapter. </p>
