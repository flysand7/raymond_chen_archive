<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Apparently driving is messed up in a lot of countries</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>From the reactions to my entry on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/01/587529.aspx"> driving in Taiwan</a>, it appears that driving is pretty messed up all over Asia. Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrEQaG5jPM"> a video of driving in India</a> that was popular a while back.
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/01/587529.aspx#587683"> This comment comparing Taiwan driving to the Philippines</a> reminded me of a conversation I had with some Filipino tourists when I was in Taiwan. We were on a bus as it was negotiating traffic, and I asked them, “Is driving in the Philippines as crazy as here in Taiwan?”</p>
<p> They answered, “Oh, no. It’s much crazier.” </p>
