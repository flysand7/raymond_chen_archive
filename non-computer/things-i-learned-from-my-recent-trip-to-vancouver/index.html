<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Things I learned from my recent trip to Vancouver</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I just got back <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">from Vancouver</a>, and boy are my arms tired! No wait, that’s not how the joke goes. </p>
<p>Here are some things I learned from my trip: </p>
<ul>
<li>    Do not pay the cashier with pennies.     Canada phased out the penny in 2013.     I missed the memo. 
<li>    Do not pay the cashier in Hong Kong dollars, either.     There was no memo on this, on the grounds that it’s totally obvious. 
<li>    It appears to be inconsistent whether Canada uses     one-based floor numbering (United States style)     or zero-based floor numbering (European style).     One building uses the United States style,     where “Floor 1” is the ground floor;     another uses zero-based, where “Floor 1”     is the first floor above the ground floor.     But     <a href="http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/no-more-skipping-4-13-14-24-in-vancouver-floor-numbers">    at least the floors are numbered consecutively</a>.     Not like in New York City, where floor numbers     <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/08/garden/for-tower-residents-a-new-math.html?pagewanted=all">    are not required to follow any particular rule</a>. 
<li>    I once again encountered the     blinking green traffic light.     I always forget what it means and have to go look it up.     It means “You have the right of way, but be aware that     cross-traffic has a stop sign rather than a stop light,     so they may enter the intersection when safe.” 
<li>    The United States calls it a “parking garage”     and in England it’s a “multi-storey car park”,     both rather unexciting functional descriptions of a parking structure.     But Canadians have a dedicated word for the concept: “parkade”.     The word is so cute,     and it reminds me of     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWQYeiB6JI&amp;t=21s">    this commercial</a>. </li></li></li></li></li></ul>
