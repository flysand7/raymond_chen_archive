<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Oh, I feel so bad for those poor Wall Street folks who have to have a normal party instead of a ridiculously lavish one</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Ah December, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Christmas Holiday</span> Winter Party season. (Even though winter doesn’t start until the 21nd, but who’s counting?) Last year, the Wall Street event planning industry suffered a downturn. (Not that they’re doing all that great this year either.) Apparently, given the softening of the economy, companies aren’t quite willing to spend the money on parties as lavish as they once did. <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2007/12/21/taking-wow-out-wall-street-parties/"> No more models hired to just walk around</a>. No limo ride home. No going-home gift.</p>
<p>The poor babies. I bet they just cried themselves to sleep.</p>
