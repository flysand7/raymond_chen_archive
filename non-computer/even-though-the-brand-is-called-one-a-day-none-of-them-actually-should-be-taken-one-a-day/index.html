<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Even though the brand is called One A Day, none of them actually should be taken one a day</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I submit for your consideration <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I97GM44?tag=tholneth-20">One A Day Teen for Her VitaCraves Gummies</a>. According to the product packaging, the serving size is “2 daily.” </p>
<p>Indeed, of all the <i>One A Day</i> vitamins listed on that page, none of them has a serving size of one. </p>
<p>“One a day, for large values of one.”¹ </p>
<p>¹ Or small values of day. </p>
