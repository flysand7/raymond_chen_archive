<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Who is most likely to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> You can count on <a href="http://www.improbable.com/"> The Annals of Improbable Research</a> to produce groundbreaking results. One of my favorites is <i><a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/air/genius.html">Who is most likely to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship?</a></i>, in which researcher (and AIR editorial board member) <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/index.html"> Eric Schulman</a> performs a careful statistical analysis of previous winners of the <a href="http://www.macfdn.org/"> MacArthur Fellowship</a> in order to determine who is most likely to win the next one. </p>
<p> Schulman also <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/air/Elections.htm"> correctly predicted the outcome of the 2004 U.S. presidential election</a> using much more complicated reasoning. </p>
