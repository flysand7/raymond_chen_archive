<p> NPR reports that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4628444"> Mandarin Chinese is gaining popularity in public schools</a>. (But please oh please don’t take pronunciations lessons from the student at time code 3:25. His first tone was clearly a second—falling victim to the classic mistake of applying English tone shaping to Chinese syllables.) On the other hand, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5191835"> some of those students who chose to study Mandarin Chinese didn’t, um, do their homework</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Some say they are here by accident or because they thought it would be an easy “A”. Oops. </p></blockquote>
<p> I do admire the argument of one parent against learning Chinese: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Everybody is going to speak English. I’m sure the Chinese all speak English. </p></blockquote>
