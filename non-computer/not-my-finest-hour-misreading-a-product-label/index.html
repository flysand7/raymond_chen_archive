<p>I had finished some store-bought soup and thought to myself, “That was a pretty good soup. What brand was it? I’ll buy it again.”</p>
<p> I went to my recycle bin to fish out the aseptic box that the soup came in, and looked for the brand name. And I found it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i51f3s2XHI"> <i>dnos</i></a>. </p>
<p> I thought to myself, “That’s a strange name for a soup company.” </p>
