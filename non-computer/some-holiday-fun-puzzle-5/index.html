<p>(Note: Read the puzzles in order from 1 to 6 for them to make sense.)</p>
<p> Number five is an old-style riddle. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> My first is an avatar, you are guardian of its soul.<br/> My second you must vanquish if you wish to reach your goal.<br/> My third you may injure if you slide too hard to third.<br/> My whole is a place where dead people can be heard.<br/> </p></blockquote>
