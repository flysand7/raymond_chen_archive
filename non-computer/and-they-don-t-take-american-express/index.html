<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">And they don't take American Express</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A conversation between two friends of mine.
 <b>Friend 1</b>: Here’s the fifteen dollars I owe you. Oh wait, I only have a twenty. Do you have a five?
 <b>Friend 2</b>: I don’t carry cash. Everybody takes credit cards.
 <b>Friend 1</b>: I don’t take credit cards.
 In my imagination, Friend 1 would have responded to “Everybody takes credit cards” with “Well, in that case, here ya go. Put it on my credit card.”</p>
