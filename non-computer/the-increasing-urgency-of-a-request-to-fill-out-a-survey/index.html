<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The increasing urgency of a request to fill out a survey</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Here are some email messages I received from an automated system. </p>
<p>October 20: “This survey must be completed no later than November 14.” </p>
<p>October 31: “Reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14.” </p>
<p>November 12: “Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14.” </p>
<p>November 14: “Extension, this survey must be completed no later than November 19.” </p>
<p>November 19: “Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 19.” </p>
<p>November 28: “This survey must be completed no later than December 16.” </p>
<p>I gave in and clicked the survey link. </p>
<p>The link was broken. </p>
<p>I guess the people running the survey said, “Gosh, we’re getting no responses. Let’s extend the deadline.” </p>
