<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Rugby: The rules for the casual viewer</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The “minimum you need to know about a sport in order to watch a match and not be completely confused” mini-series continues with rugby, whose World Cup is currently under way.</p>
<p>First of all, there are two flavors of rugby: Rugby league and rugby union. The one being contested at the World Cup right now is rugby union, and that’s the one I’ll cover here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The playing area (<b>pitch</b>) has a lot of lines. Don’t worry about most of them. The <b>touch lines</b> run along the sides, <b>goal lines</b> are at the ends, and and <b>dead ball lines</b> are beyond the goal lines. The touch lines and dead ball lines form the playing boundary. The lines themselves are considered out of play.</li>
<li>A team consists of 15 players, with 8 substitutions permitted. A player who is replaced may not return, with exceptions for temporary injuries.</li>
<li>The game consists of two 40-minute halves, plus stoppage time. If time expires while play is active, the play is allowed to run its course, plus any penalties that may ensue. Games can end in a draw.</li>
<li>The team with the ball may run with it or kick it. The ball may be thrown sideways or backward, but not forward.</li>
<li>The defense stops the advance by tackling the player with the ball. Players who jump into the air and catch the ball are safe from being tackled until they land.</li>
<li>The offense may not obstruct the defense’s path to the ball. (No blocking.)</li>
<li>A tackled ball carrier must get rid of the ball immediately.</li>
<li>A ball carrier on the ground (not yet tackled) must get up or get rid of the ball.</li>
<li>If three or more players contest a ball while standing, it is a <b>maul</b>. If three or more players contest a ball on the ground, it is a <b>ruck</b>, and the ball must be played with the feet. In both cases, players must remain standing.</li>
<li>A player who announces “<b>mark</b>” and catches the ball behind their own 22-meter line is awarded a free kick from the point of catch. (Marks may not be called during the kick-off.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Scoring</b>: There are two basic categories of scoring: The <b>try</b> and the <b>kick</b>. Kicks must go through the goal posts.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>try</b>: 5 points for touching the ball to the ground beyond the opponent’s goal line. After a try, the scoring team attempts a conversion kick.</li>
<li><b>conversion kick</b>: 2 points, taken in line with the point the try was made, from any distance. (Tries closer to the center of the goal line therefore make for easier conversions.)</li>
<li><b>drop kick</b>: 3 points for kicks from the field.</li>
<li><b>penalty kick</b>: 3 points for kicks from a penalty kick.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The line-out</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If the ball or ball carrier touches the ground out of bounds, a <b>line-out</b> is awarded to the team that did not last touch the ball.</li>
<li>The position of the line-out is generally the point the ball left the field, with adjustments if it is close to a goal line. Some situations result in a line-out at the point of kick.</li>
<li>Both teams line up perpendicular to the touch line. The defense may not line up more players than the throwing team.</li>
<li>The rules on where players may stand are complicated. Let’s just assume that they are standing in the right place.</li>
<li>The ball is thrown perpendicular to the touch line.</li>
<li>Players are permitted to lift teammates to reach the ball.</li>
<li>A team may perform a quick throw-in if the defense is slow to form a line-out.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The scrum</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>scrum</b> is perhaps one of the iconic elements of rugby. It is used to restart play after a minor infringement, such as throwing the ball forward. It is also used if the ball is trapped in a maul or ruck.</li>
<li>Eight players from each team form a carefully architected huddle, and the team awarded the ball rolls it into the <b>tunnel</b>.</li>
<li>Each team attempts to push the other team backward so that a designated player (the <b>hooker</b>) can kick the ball backward to a teammate.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fouls</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fouls include obstruction, violent play, intentionally <b>collapsing</b> a maul or ruck, and improper tackles.</li>
<li>The <b>offside</b> rule is complicated, but basically you may not be ahead of the ball and participate in the play. For a maul, ruck, or scrum, players who are not contesting the ball must remain behind those who are.</li>
<li>The referee may decline to enforce a foul if they feel the offended team has the advantage.</li>
<li>When a penalty kick is awarded, the opposing team must yield 10 meters.</li>
<li>A team may elect to restart with a scrum rather than a penalty kick.</li>
<li>For serious fouls, the referee issues a <b>yellow card</b>, and the player must sit out for ten minutes, leaving the team shorthanded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The open-field portion of rugby is pretty easy to figure out after watching it for a little while. The most confusing part is when there’s a crowd around the ball, because you can’t see what’s going on or what they’re trying to do.</p>
