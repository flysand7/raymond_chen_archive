<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The NPR Planet Money one-hour story competition: The shopping mall convention</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Voting closed last night on the second NPR Planet Money one-hour story competition. Three reporters were sent into a convention (this time, the <i>International Council of Shopping Centers</i> conference) and given one hour to collect tape for a story. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/12/podcast_iron_reporter_competit.html"> Listen to the results</a>, either in the full podcast format or just to the three individual stories.
 Each of the stories was interesting in its own way. From Adam Davidson, I learned some mall restaurant jargon. From Chana Joffe-Walt, I learned about the pursuit of the cool kids. And from Alex Blumberg, I learned why a guy dressed in a bright red blazer known only as <i>McGuire</i> is the most popular guy at the convention.
 My vote went to Chana’s story.</p>
