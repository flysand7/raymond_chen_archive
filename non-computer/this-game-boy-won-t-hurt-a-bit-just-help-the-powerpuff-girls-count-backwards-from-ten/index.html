<p>Is there nothing a Game Boy can’t do? We already learned that <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/18/134052.aspx"> it can be played like a musical instrument</a>. Now we discover that <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/state/ny-bc-nj--hospitals-gameboy1209dec09,0,709638.story"> letting children play with a Game Boy before surgery is more effective than tranquilizers or a parent’s hand at keeping them calm</a>.</p>
<p> You know <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1617"> when you go to the dentist</a> and she asks you, “What flavor fluoride rinse would you like?” Perhaps someday the anaesthetist will ask you, “Do you want a Game Boy or a Nintendo?” </p>
