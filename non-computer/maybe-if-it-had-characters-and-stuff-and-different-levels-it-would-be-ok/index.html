<p>In a classic series, Electronic Games Monthly plopped modern kids, ages 9 through 12, in front of classic video games: Pong, Donkey Kong, Tetris. <a href="http://www.lyberty.com/blog/articles/childs_play.htm"> And then recorded their reactions</a>. Here, the kids are playing Tetris and appear to be obsessed with stuff blowing up.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Tim</b>: Which button do I press to make the blocks explode? </p>
<p> <b>EGM</b>: Sorry, they don’t explode. </p>
<p> <b>Becky</b>: This is boring. Maybe if it had characters and stuff and different levels, it would be OK. If things blew up or something or— </p>
<p> <b>Sheldon</b>: If there were bombs. </p>
<p> <b>Becky</b>: Yeah, or special bricks. Like, if a yellow brick touched a red brick it would blow up and you’d have to start over. </p>
<p> <b>John</b>: Why haven’t I won yet? I’ve paired up so many of the same color. </p>
<p> <b>EGM</b>: Don’t worry about colors. </p>
<p> <b>John</b>: I just lined up six of the same color. Why didn’t they blow up? </p>
<p> <b>EGM</b>: Nothing blows up. </p>

<p> Best single line: “I’m sure everyone who made this game is dead by now.”</p>
<p> The article was such a hit that they <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3137498"> did it again</a> the following year. </p>
