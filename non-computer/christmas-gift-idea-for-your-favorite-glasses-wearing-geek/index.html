<p>Yes, I’m talking about Christmas gifts (or “winter solstice gifts” if you prefer) in July. I’m one of those people for whom buying Christmas gifts is a brain-wracking ordeal, and I’m always on the lookout all year round for the “perfect gift”.
 Last Christmas, a friend of mine gave me a micro-fiber lens-cleaning cloth that comes in a pouch you can attach to a keychain. <a href="http://www.eyeglass.com/products-accessories-cloths.html"> Example 1</a>. <a href="http://www.17photo.com/product.asp?id=HMFCS"> Example 2</a>. (I have no affiliation with those two sites; I just hunted around looking for a picture.) Best gift ever. I use it several times a day.</p>
<p> My keychain has only four things on it: The aforementioned cleaning cloth, a USB thumb drive, my car key, and my house key. And I could do without the thumb drive and car key most days. But don’t take away my cleaning cloth. </p>
