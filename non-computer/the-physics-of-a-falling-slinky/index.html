<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The physics of a falling Slinky</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blog.richmond.edu/physicsbunn/"> Professor Ted Bunn</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?node=694510&amp;tag=tholneth-20">no relation</a>), who still gets email about <a href="http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/BHfaq.html"> a Black Holes FAQ</a> he wrote over fifteen years ago, recently blogged about what happens when you suspend a Slinky vertically, then let go.
 <i>No wait, come back</i>.</p>
<p> In <a href="http://blog.richmond.edu/physicsbunn/2012/06/25/fun-for-a-girl-and-a-boy/"> Part the First</a>, he provides an alternate (but equivalent) explanation for the phenomenon.
 Allen Downey on his wonderfully-titled blog <a href="http://allendowney.blogspot.com/"> <i>Probably Overthinking It</i></a> <a href="http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2012/06/falling-slinky-problem.html"> started in with the equations</a>, which inspired Ted to write <a href="http://blog.richmond.edu/physicsbunn/2012/06/26/more-on-the-slinky/"> Part the Second</a>, which contains with lots of math, <i>but there are also charts</i>.</p>
<p> Okay, fine, I don’t blame you for leaving. </p>
