<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mother's Day is for all mothers, not just your own mother</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This upcoming Sunday is Mother’s Day in the United States, and I’m reminded of a little story from several years ago.
 One day, we asked a colleague how he and his new child were planning to celebrate Mother’s Day.
 “Yup, I’m all over that. I mailed a gift to my mother earlier this week, and I’ll call her on Sunday.”
 <i>— Um, aren’t you forgetting somebody?</i>
 “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”
 <i>— What about your wife Betty?</i>
 A beat.
 “I should do something for Betty’s mother?”</p>
<p> Let this be a cautionary tale for new fathers. </p>
