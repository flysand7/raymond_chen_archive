<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The unwritten rule of riding a Seattle Metro bus</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/"> Metro King County transit site</a> has all the facts about <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/bus/howride.html"> how to ride the bus</a>, but there’s another rule that is applied by convention rather than by any formal codification:</p>
<p> For some reason, and I see this only in Seattle, it is customary to say <i>Thank you</i> to the bus driver as you get off the bus. </p>
<p> <b>Tip for new riders</b>: If you aren’t familiar with the area, you can <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/accessible/calloutstops/helping.html"> ask the bus driver to announce the stop you intend to get off at</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus tip for bicyclists</b>: There is an experimental program running this summer to allow bicyclists to <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/bike/bike-520demo.html"> ride out-of-service buses across the 520 bridge for free</a>. You have to get on at Evergreen Point and get off at Montlake (or vice versa). This is in addition to the existing policy of allow bicyclists to <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/tops/bike/i-520.html"> ride out-of-service buses across the bridge (paying the normal fare)</a>, eastbound as far as 51st St, assuming the bus is heading that way. (This bonus tip is not that helpful to Microsoft employees, who already get free bus passes and a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/330998_software10.html"> special bike shuttle</a>, but I figured I’d toss it out there.) </p>
