<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The first day at Microsoft: A fender-bender</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> This is the first of what might be a series of stories on the subject, <i>So what happened on your first day at Microsoft?</i> Some facts may have been altered to preserve the anonymity of the subject, but the essense is true. Our first storyteller is “Employee X”: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> At the end of my first day, I back out of my parking space and accidentally hit a Lexus parked behind me. Oh great, my first day at work, and I dent somebody’s fancy car. I leave a note of apology on the windshield, with my name, email address, phone number, and a promise to pay for whatever repairs are necessary. </p>
<p> The next day, I come to work, and I have a new email message. </p>
<p> From Bill Gates. </p>
<p> Oh my God, I dented Bill Gates’ car. </p>
<p> Fortunately, he said not to worry about it. </p>
