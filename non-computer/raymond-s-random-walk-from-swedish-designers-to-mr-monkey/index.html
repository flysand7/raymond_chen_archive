<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond's random walk, from Swedish designers to Mr. Monkey</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My random walk began at <a href="http://www.svd.se/">Svenska Dagbladet</a> and the article <a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_9179146.asp"> Svensk designer upprör skottar</a>, about Swedish designer Johanna Larson whose T-shirt depicting the traffic-cone-wearing Duke of Wellington has sparked a debate in the city.
 The article mentions that the tradition of placing a traffic cone on the head of the Duke is twenty years old, and my search for further information on this ongoing prank led me to <a href="http://www.leyton.org/"> Richard Leyton</a>‘s musings on <a href="http://www.leyton.org/archives/2005/01/a_permanent_cone_for_wellington.html"> whether the traffic cone should be glued in place permanently</a>.
 At the end of his entry, he links to the wonderful web site of <a href="http://www.houseoftheorangemonkey.co.uk/"> Mr Monkey</a> and in particular <a href="http://www.houseoftheorangemonkey.co.uk/monkey/trips/trip1305.htm"> Mr Monkey’s visit to the statue to see it for himself</a>.</p>
<p> The Mr Monkey web site is one of the hidden treasures of the Internet. Sure, it may not be entirely original, but Mr Monkey himself is so goofy-looking, the pictures are for the most part quite well-composed, and the subtitles are the icing on the cake. </p>
