<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Rearranging the cities into a much more visually pleasing arrangement</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My friend the seventh grade teacher gave an assignment wherein students were to produce a map of the state of Washington with various required elements, among them, a selection of major cities in the state. Some students failed to understand that the purpose of a map is to represent where the cities are and not to dictate to the cities where they should be, for they moved the cities around in strange ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some students put     <a href="http://www.ci.port-angeles.wa.us/">     Port Angeles</a> 100 miles inland nowhere near any body of water.     Psst, it’s a port.     Ports are not as effective when they are 100 miles inland. </li>
<li>Other students took the idea of a port too far     and put Port Angeles 100 miles out to sea.     This sort of misses out the other half of being a port,     which is being <i>connected to land</i>. </li>
<li>But the winners of the <i>Unclear on the concept</i> award     are the students who moved the cities around.     “All these dots looked all crooked and stuff,     so I moved them around to make a straight line. Was that wrong?” </li>
</ul>
<p> Moving the dots around to make a more visually pleasing arrangement might work if you were designing, say, a <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.gif"> transit map</a>, where the topology of the connections is the important thing rather than their physical arrangement in space. But this wasn’t one of those times. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Another student decided to embellish the map by coloring everything outside the boundaries of the state in blue. Psst, the color blue has special meaning in maps. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teraina"> Washington is not an island</a>. </p>
