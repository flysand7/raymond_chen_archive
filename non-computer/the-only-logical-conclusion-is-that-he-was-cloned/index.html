<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The only logical conclusion is that he was cloned</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Something is wrong with the world when <a href="http://www.fark.com/">fark</a> finds something “real” news organizations miss. (When I first learned about fark, I confused it with <a href="http://www.farcep.org/">FARC</a>, a different organization entirely. That’s right, a terrorist organization has its own official web site. Gotta love the Internet.)</p>
<p>Anyway, fark has pointed out that the guy that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Al-Qaida-Hunt.html">Pakistani forces claim today to have surrounded along the border with Afghanistan</a>, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,651986,00.html">already reported to have been captured two years ago</a> by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Grauniad</a>. They never printed a correction (as far as I can tell) so I guess he cloned himself.</p>
