<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Time to dust off your conspiracy theories</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I started studying Swedish, my web searches happened to alight upon <a href="http://francisstrand.blogspot.com/"> Francis Strand’s blog</a> thanks to its wonderful title, “How to learn Swedish in 1000 difficult lessons”, and I’ve been following his musings on life on Stockholm ever since.</p>
<p> Wednesday morning, <a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&amp;a=352551"> an apartment just a block away from his own exploded</a> under curious circumstances. According to the initial report, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  A man is missing after the powerful explosion which blew out an entire apartment on Surbrunnsgatan in Stockholm early Wednesday morning. … </p>
<p> The apartment’s resident was not found among the evacuatees. … Police bomb-sniffing dogs searched through the apartment without any indication of explosives. The police’s main theory, therefore, is that a gas leak caused the explosion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Later that day, <a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&amp;a=352832"> that theory fell under suspicion</a>, at least by the conspiracy-minded press: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  “Nothing points to gas explosion.” </p>
<p> An expert at the energy company Fortum doubts that the violent explosion was caused by gas. </p>
<p> “There are things which are inconsistent with a gas explosion. First of all, the explosion should have caused a fire if it had to do with a gas flow. If it is still a question of a gas accident, it is unique in its scope. … A huge amount of gas is required for so powerful a blast. The residence must have been filled to the gills. We have no documented instance of this type of explosion ever being caused by accident.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Even more interesting is that <a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&amp;a=352660"> the apartment’s resident had been released by the police just last Friday</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  The missing man is suspected of book theft. </p>
<p> The owner of the Surbrunnsgatan apartment which exploded is the man who is suspected of theft in the millions [of Swedish Kronor] from the Royal Library.  The man was released from custody last Friday. </p>
<p> The 48-year-old had been held in custody for approximately one month. On Thursday, police held a so-called conclusion hearing with the man. Prosecutor Stefan Lind determined later that there was no reason to continue holding the 48-year-old who was released on Friday. “But the investigation into him continues,” says Stefan Lind. </p>
<p> The 48-year-old allegedly stole millions of Kronor worth of rarities [rare books, presumably] from the library where he was employed. The man has to some degree admitted to the crimes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Francis’s current houseguest thinks the man was killed by the people he sold the books to.  I myself don’t know what to think. It’s just plain curious. </p>
<p> The Swedish word for the day is <font color="red">själ</font>. It means <i>soul</i>. [Updated 9am: Got the word wrong! I had written skäl instead of själ.  That’ll teach me to flatter by imitation. Only Francis Strand can do it right.] </p>
