<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Leave it to the Taiwanese to think of wrapping a donut inside another donut</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The food known in Mandarin Chinese as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao"> 油條 (yóutiáo)</a>, but which in Taiwanese goes by the name 油炸粿, is basically a fried stick of dough, similar to a cruller, but puffier rather than cakey. The traditional way of eating it is to wrap it inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaobing"> 燒餅</a> (a sesame-coated flatbread), and dip the entire combination into a bowl of hot soy milk. I prefer salty soy milk, but some people prefer sweet. (Those people who prefer the sweet version are clearly wrong.)
 Obviously, the <i>donut sandwich</i> was invented before the low-carb diet craze.
 <b>Sidebar</b>: Salty soy milk (鹹豆漿) is one of those nostalgia breakfasts for me, or more accurately, one of those manufactured nostalgia breakfasts, because I didn’t actually eat it that much as a child.</p>
<p> <b>Sidebar 2</b>: For authentic Chinese food in Seattle, my choice is <a href="http://www.chiangsgourmet.com/"> Chiang’s Gourmet</a>. They have an extensive menu of standard Chinese breakfast foods. The service is surly, but that somehow just adds to the experience. </p>
