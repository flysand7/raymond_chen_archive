<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Distinguishing between normative and positive statements to help people answer your question</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Often, we get questions from a customer that use the word <i>should</i> in an ambiguous way:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Our program creates a widget whose <a href="http://backtothefuture.wikia.com/wiki/Flux_capacitor"> flux capacitor</a> should have reverse polarity. Attached is a sample program that shows how we create the widget with <code>Create­Widget</code>. However, the resulting widget still has a flux capacitor with standard polarity. Can you help us? </p></blockquote>
<p> The phrase <i>should have reverse polarity</i> is ambiguous. The question could be</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We would like to create a widget whose flux capacitor has reverse polarity. Attached is a sample program that shows how to create a widget whose flux capacitor has standard polarity. How should we modify it in order to get reverse polarity? </p></blockquote>
<p> Or the question might be</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We would like to create a widget whose flux capacitor has reverse polarity. Attached is a sample program that attempts to do so, but the resulting widget has a flux capacitor with standard polarity. The polarity flag appears to be ignored. Are are we doing something wrong, or is this a bug in Windows? </p></blockquote>
<p> The first is a normative statement: “This is what we would like to happen.” The second is a positive statement: “This is what is happening.”
 The distinction is important because the two types of statements require very different types of responses. If have a program that does X, and you want to change it to do Y, then you’re asking for help working through the Y feature, clarifying the documentation, informing you which flags you need to pass, and so on. But if you have a program that tries to do Y and fails, then you’re asking for help debugging your code and possibly identifying a bug in the operating system.
 Being clear with your request means that you can avoid wasting a lot of time when the wrong set of people are called in to help you out.
 Here’s another example of vague use of the word <i>should</i>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’re trying to do XYZ. We’ve been told that it is blocked for security reasons, but there should be a way to do this. </p></blockquote>
<p> In this case, it is not clear what the customer means by the phrase <i>should be a way to do this</i>. It could be</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’re trying to do XYZ. We’ve been told that it is blocked for security reasons, but we think that Windows should be changed to allow our scenario. How can we file a change request with the Windows security team to make an exception for us? </p></blockquote>
<p> Or the customer might be trying to say</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’re trying to do XYZ. We’ve been told that it is blocked for security reasons, but we think that there is a way to get the effect of XYZ without triggering the security issue. Can you help us find it? </p></blockquote>
<p> Note that in both cases, the customer either <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/15/1883515.aspx"> failed to asked a question</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/12/4872632.aspx"> made some statements and asked for nonspecific advice</a>, which is effectly the same as not asking a question. If they had remembered to ask a question, then that question would have clarified what they intended by the word <i>should</i>.
 <b>Bonus chatter</b>: A physicist classmate of mine got a chuckle out of the phrase <i>flux capacitor</i> because it combines two physics terms in an impressive-sounding but mostly nonsensical way.
 A <i>capacitor</i> is a device which stores electric potential. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy"> hydraulic analogy of electricity</a>, a capacitor is a rubber diaphragm that separates two parts of a pipe, but which “stores” water flow by stretching and “discharges” the water flow by returning to its rest position.
 <i>Flux</i> is cross-sectional flow per unit time. Water flux is volumetric flow rate (liters per second per square meter): it measures how vigorously the water flows across a boundary. Magnetic flux measures the strength of a magnetic field.
 The combination is nonsensical because the units don’t match. A capacitor stores potential, whereas flux is measured in current or magnetic field strength. But if you generalize the term <i>capacitor</i> to mean “a thing that stores stuff”, then a <i>flux capacitor</i> is a device which stores a magnetic field.</p>
<p> Such devices already exist today. They are called <i>magnets</i>. </p>
