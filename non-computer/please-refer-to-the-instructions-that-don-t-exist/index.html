<p>I bought myself a wireless mouse and was setting it up. Step 1: Insert the batteries. Check. Step 2: Position the receiver.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Make sure the distance between the mouse and receiver is within the wireless range specified on the packaging. </p></blockquote>
<p> I wanted to put the receiver on the floor, off of my desk, so I had to make sure it would still be in range of the mouse on my desk. Let’s look at the packaging.
 Nope, no mention of the receiver range.</p>
<p> I guess this proves that nobody reads the installation instructions. </p>
