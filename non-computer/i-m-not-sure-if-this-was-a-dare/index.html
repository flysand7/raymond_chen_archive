<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I'm not sure if this was a dare</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/">Joe Beda</a> stopped by my office, clutching         a stack of documents he had just had notarized, and told me, “Raymond, you should         become a notary public.”      </p>
<p>         “Why?”      </p>
<p>         “It’d be fun.”      </p>
<p>         “Notarizing documents is fun?”      </p>
<p>         “No, just <u>being</u> a notary public – just knowing that you had the power to notarize         documents – would be fun. Besides, you’d be good at it, since you’re such a stickler         for the rules. I wonder what the qualifications for being a notary public are, anyway.”      </p>
<p>         So I went and looked up <a href="http://www.dol.wa.gov/unfc/notfront.htm">the process         of becoming a notary public in the State of Washington</a>.      </p>
<p>     The requirements are deceptively simple: Ability to execute the duties of a notary     public (and indeed, requirement to perform said duties upon demand), a $10,000 surety     bond, a clean criminal record, and three character references who will affirm that     I am “a person of good moral character”. That last one might be tricky.  </p>
