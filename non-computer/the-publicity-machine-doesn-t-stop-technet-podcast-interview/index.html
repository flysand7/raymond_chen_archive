<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The publicity machine doesn't stop: TechNet podcast interview</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/podcast/"> TechNet Magazine Podcast page</a> has just posted their February 2007 entry, which includes an interview with little old me in the second half. I haven’t listened to the whole interview yet, but what struck me immediately is that I was pretty darned punchy and goofy, whereas I think <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tnmag/archive/2007/01/18/technet-magazine-podcasts.aspx"> the host</a> was trying to take a more serious tone. Oops.</p>
