<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Whew, I’m not doing *that* again!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I met <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/">Sara Ford</a> at the 2008 PDC, I got to talk to her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735626405?tag=tholneth-20"> author</a>–<i>a</i>–<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321440307?tag=tholneth-20">author</a>. I asked her how the book-writing experience was.</p>
<p> “I’m never doing <i>that</i> again!” she replied. </p>
<p> Yeah, that’s pretty much how I feel about it, too. <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2008/04/02/book-piracy-2/"> Steve Makofsky agrees</a>. (Though, to be fair, what Sara was not going to do was write a book <i>in three months</i>, as opposed to swearing off writing books entirely.) </p>
<p> By the way, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> my book</a> is <a href="http://hibid.hinet.net/biditemdetailaction.do?bidsn=466414"> now available in Chinese</a>. I don’t get any royalties when people buy a translated copy, so buy it or not, I don’t care. Actually, I make barely any money from the book at all. During one six-month period, I sold a net of two copies in the United States. Enough to maybe buy a cup of tea. Seeing as most of the book content is available for free on this Web site, I’m not entirely convinced that <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20080714/1150181670.shtml"> giving away your book for free increases sales</a>. (Or maybe the conclusion is that my book’s sales would have been even worse if it weren’t available here online. Perhaps it would have sold only <i>one</i> copy.) </p>
