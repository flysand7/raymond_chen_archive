<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Weight Gain 4000, the competition</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some years ago, one of my colleagues mentioned at the lunch table, “I went hiking this weekend, and man, my backpack was so heavy. I weighed it, and it was like 35 pounds. And then I realized, wait a second, I’m overweight by 35 pounds. I’m carrying this heavy backpack <i>all the time</i>!”
 Thus began a collective weight loss competition we called <i>Weight Gain 4000</i>, named after <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/episodes/102/Weight-Gain-4000.html"> an episode of <i>South Park</i></a> which had aired recently. (“I’m not fat; I’m big-boned!”) I set up a Web page where people could enter their current weight, and it charted everyone’s <i>pounds over target weight</i> as a function of time. Oh, and the goal was to lose weight, not gain it.
 It so happened that I won this little competition with the aid of some extra bike rides. Then again, I also had the least amount of weight to lose. And my colleagues accused me of cheating because I managed to accelerate my weight loss as the deadline approached. (But I didn’t cheat, honest!)</p>
<p> I was reminded of this competition from years ago when I read about <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2004374437_fatbet28.html"> John Dirks and Adam Orkand</a> who also learned that an effective way to make you stick to your weight loss plan is to <a href="http://www.fatbet.net/"> make a wager out of it</a>. </p>
