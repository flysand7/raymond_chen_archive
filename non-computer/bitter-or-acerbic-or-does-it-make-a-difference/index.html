<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Bitter or acerbic? or does it make a difference?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues told me that my name came up in conversation, and somebody said that they thought I had a reputation for being bitter. </p>
<p>My colleague defended me. “Nah, Raymond isn’t bitter. He’s, I dunno, acerbic.” </p>
<p>“Acerbic? What does that mean?” </p>
<p>My colleague <a href="http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/search?q=define+acerbic&amp;qpvt=acerbic&amp;FORM=DTPDIA">looked it up</a>. </p>
<p>“It means, um… bitter.” </p>
