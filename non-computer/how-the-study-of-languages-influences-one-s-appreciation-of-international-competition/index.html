<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How the study of languages influences one's appreciation of international competition</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One of the consequences of studying another language for me is that I develop some sort of mental connection with the people who speak that language, despite having no innate cultural basis for it. When I studied German, I found myself cheering for the German athletes in the Olympic Games. And in the men’s 4×10,000 cross-country relay yesterday, I was cheering for the German team, the Swedish team, and the Norwegian team (especially the Norwegians), but it was all for naught as <a href="http://www.torino2006.org/ENG/IDF/CC/C73C_CCM410101.html"> the Italians proved too much for all of them</a>. </p>
<p> (Yes, I haven’t started studying Norwegian yet, but, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130455.aspx"> as my Swedish readers already know</a>, it was the Lillehammer Olympics that reinforced my interest in the Scandinavian languages, and with it, my affinity for the Norwegian cross-country team.) </p>
