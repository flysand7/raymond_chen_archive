<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Should I fix the spelling in the United States Constitution?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Dave jokingly remarked, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/05/1416853.aspx#1417026">I’ve grown used to handling characters with ASCII. (If it was good enough to represent every character in the US Constitution, it’s good enough for me.)</a>”
 But there’s a double-joke in there. You see, not every character in the United States Constitution can be represented in ASCII!
 If you <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Constitution_Pg1of4_AC.jpg"> take a close look</a>, you’ll see that some words appear to be “misspelled”: At the end of the second line, it says “<i>Bleſsings</i> of Liberty”, and Article 1 Section 1 declares that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a <i>Congreſs</i> of the United States.”
 That f-like character is actually a <a href="http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/06/rules-for-long-s.html"> long S</a>, a character which has fallen into disuse in modern English. It also doesn’t exist in ASCII.</p>
<p> My friend <a href="http://theknittyprofessor.typepad.com/blog/"> The Knitty Professor</a> told me a story of a class she taught many years ago. A student emailed a question: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When I want to quote an excerpt from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/07/1825856.aspx"> Locke</a> in my paper, should I fix the spelling? Some words use f instead of s, and others are <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/29691/"> incorrectly capitalized</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p> Today is Constitution Day, a United States holiday celebrating the United States Constitution. Since 2005, all educational institutions which receive federal funds must teach about the United States Constitution on this day, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5491931"> even hairdresser schools</a>. </p>
