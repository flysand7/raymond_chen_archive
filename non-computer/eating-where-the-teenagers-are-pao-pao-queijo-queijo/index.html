<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Eating where the teenagers are: Pão Pão, Queijo Queijo</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006066.aspx"> In Belém</a>, directly to the east of the <a href="http://www.mosteirojeronimos.pt/english/index_mosteiro.html"> <i>Mosteiro dos Jerónimos</i></a> is a block of small shops, the most famous one of which being the <a href="http://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/"> <i>Pastéis de Belém</i></a> which sells the, um, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata"> <span lang="pt-pt">Pastel de Belém</span></a>, the Belém version of the unofficial dessert of Portugal. (<a href="http://www.eamon.the-byte-factory.com/2008/04/15/day-12-lisbon-portugal/">This photo of a group of people eating</a> was taken in front of the <span lang="pt-pt">Pastéis de Belém</span> shop. You can see the blue awnings in the background.) The place is always packed shoulder-to-shoulder with tourists. So turn around, leave the store, and walk back toward the <i>Mosteiro dos Jerónimos</i>. At about where the pink building is in the photo referenced above is a tiny shop called <a href="http://www.lifecooler.com/portugal/restaurantes/PaoPaoQueijoQueijo"> <i> Pão Pão, Queijo Quejo</i></a>, which means <a href="http://seeportugal.org/2008/03/23/belem-lisbon-more-then-just-a-tower/"> Bread Bread Cheese Cheese</a>. If the photo doesn’t help, here’s how you find it: It’s the one packed to the gills with teenagers.
 Now, following the teenagers to decide where to eat is a hit-or-miss affair. You might find an awesome little shop, or you might end up at McDonalds. I lucked out and scored a major win.</p>
<p> Here’s how you enjoy lunch at Pão Pão, Queijo Queijo: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the menu board posted outside to decide what you want.     Have your dictionary handy since it’s only in Portuguese. </li>
<li>Join the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/27/8553639.aspx">     mob-like approximation of a line</a>     that snakes out the door. </li>
<li>When you reach the register near the door,     place your order and pay for it.     You will receive an order slip. </li>
<li>Join the mob inside the store and try to work your way to     the counter where all the food is. </li>
<li>Get the attention of somebody behind the counter.     You are competing with two dozen other people at this point,     so it may take some effort. </li>
<li>Hand the person your order slip and do your best to answer     questions like “Do you want sauce?” and “For here or to go?”     The correct answers are “Only a little” and “To go”, by the way. </li>
<li>Receive your sandwiches, grab some extra napkins,     and walk across the street to the park. </li>
<li>Enjoy your sandwich in the park while taking in the view of the     <a href="http://michaelbarrientos.blogspot.com/2007/05/ponte-25-de-abril.html"> <i>Ponte 25 de Abril</i></a>     (the April 25 Bridge),     then take a nap in the warm sunshine. </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/19/8518566.aspx"> Second only to salt in the Portuguese diet</a> appears to be ranch dressing/mayonnaise/whatever that white sauce is. (Hence the need for extra napkins and the correct answer of “Only a little.”) If you’re not careful, you’ll find your sandwich drowning in approximately ten cubic meters of the stuff. But once you get past that, you have a tasty sandwich with warm meat and crunchy slaw on a crisp baguette. It’s sort of a Portuguese version of a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/21/8525412.aspx"> Vietnamese sandwich</a>. </p>
