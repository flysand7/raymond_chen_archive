<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">See the Seattle Symphony on television in high definition</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> If you missed it on Saturday and Sunday night, you have a few more chances left. Set your DVR to record <a href="http://www.kcts.org/seriesdetail.asp?N1=SSBE"> <i>Seattle Symphony from Benaroya Hall: Brahms, Kernis and Kodály</i></a> on one of its handful of repeat airings this week (the next one is tonight at 6pm on KCTS-HD). According to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/theaterarts/2003664204_conc13.html"> the story in the <i>Seattle Times</i></a>, it includes close-ups of nearly every member of the orchestra so you can watch their fingerwork or their facial expressions, plus a behind-the-scenes cam so you can finally find out what the conductor and soloist are doing when they step backstage during the curtain calls.</p>
