<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nearly everybody has a $500 flashlight</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When I described <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/20/471749.aspx"> using a laptop computer as an impromptu flashlight</a>, that triggered a lot of comments from people using their cell phone or PDA as a flashlight. One nickname I’ve heard for this phenomenon is “<a href="http://tjotala.com/archives/54">the $500 flashlight</a>“, $500 being the price of a PDA or SmartPhone at the time the term was coined. (I was amused to find that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061024023059/http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/09/index.html#entry-12516191"> even Scott Adams does this</a>.) </p>
<p> A few years ago, on a trip to <a href="http://www.tikalpark.com/"> Tikal</a>, I took part in a pre-dawn hike into the park in order to observe the sunrise from <a href="http://mayaruins.com/tikal/b3_028.html"> atop Temple IV</a>. For many people (including me), this was an impulse tour rather than a planned option, so we hadn’t packed flashlights in our gear. There were a lot of $500 flashlights on that hike. </p>
