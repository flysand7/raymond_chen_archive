<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Parents billed when kids miss school: Pay for play</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The Scotts Valley school system is asking parents to compensate the district <a href="http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2007/03/09/news/national/doc45f1646272164939961249.txt"> when they take their kids out of school to go on vacation</a>. Adds a new wrinkle to the phrase “pay for play”. </p>
<p> I remember the days when we were taught the difference between the things you <i>must</i> do (obligations, responsibilities) and the things you <i>want</i> to do. </p>
