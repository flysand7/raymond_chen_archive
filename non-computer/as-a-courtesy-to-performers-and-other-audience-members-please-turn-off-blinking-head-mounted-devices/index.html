<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">As a courtesy to performers and other audience members, please turn off blinking head-mounted devices</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When a theater or concert performance begins, there is often an announcement asking audience members to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/20/471750.aspx"> silence their cell phones and similar devices</a>. Some time ago, a light blinked near the ear of a gentleman a few rows in front of me throughout the entire performance. I couldn’t tell what it was for sure, but it appeared to be the indicator light of a Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p> Blink. </p>
<p> Five seconds later: </p>
<p> Blink. </p>
<p> Five seconds later: </p>
<p> Blink. </p>
<p> Repeat for two hours. </p>
<p> What I want to know is, was this guy expecting a call <i>during the show</i>? If his phone rang, would he answer it from his seat? </p>
<p> (Added: This was before Bluetooth headsets were in common use. It wasn’t until after the show that I was able to guess what it was.) </p>
