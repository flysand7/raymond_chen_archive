<p>First, A<span>B</span>BA rises to stardom in their native Sweden with <i>Ring, Ring</i>. They then win the Eurovision Song Contest with <i>Waterloo</i>, which is also recorded in English, French, German, and probably Spanish.
 Twenty-five years later, the English-language musical <i><a href="http://www.mamma-mia.com/">Mamma-Mia</a></i> premieres in London and subsequently spreads through large portions of the world not yet civilized enough to ban fluorescent pink tuxedos or platform shoes.</p>
<p> And now, the musical is being translated into Swedish and <a href="http://audition.briggenteater.se/">auditions are being taken</a> for a scheduled opening in Stockholm on 12 February 2005. </p>
