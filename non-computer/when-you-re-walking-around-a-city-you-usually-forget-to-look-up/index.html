<p> When you’re walking around a city, you usually forget to look up. It takes <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/"> a landmark building</a> to prompt you to admire anything above the ground floor. </p>
<p> For those in the Seattle area, the <i>Seattle Times</i> included a brief <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2008064590_architecture22.html"> walking tour of Seattle architecture</a>. The article doesn’t mention one of my favorites: <a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=ry0yn74t4wk6&amp;style=b&amp;lvl=1&amp;alt=-1000&amp;scene=3702620&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;encType=1"> The roll-on deodorant building</a> on the corner of Seneca and Second. The effect is most striking if you if you stand on Second and Union and look southeast at night. (Sadly, under the dome is just <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=44621"> a roomful of machines</a>.) </p>
