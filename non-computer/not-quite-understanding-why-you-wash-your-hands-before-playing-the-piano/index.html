<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Not quite understanding why you wash your hands before playing the piano</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My niece wanted to play my piano, and I asked her to wash her hands. She said, “I don’t need that, I have Magic Soap,” and she produced a bottle of hand sanitizer.
 Um, the purpose of washing your hands isn’t so the piano doesn’t get sick.</p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/30/2332225.aspx"> My piano-instructor cousin-in-law</a> tells me that her young students often say, “My hands are not dirty. They are just a little sticky because I just ate a chocolate muffin on my way here. I don’t think I need to wash my hands. Why do you <i>always</i> ask me to wash my hands before the piano lesson?” </p>
