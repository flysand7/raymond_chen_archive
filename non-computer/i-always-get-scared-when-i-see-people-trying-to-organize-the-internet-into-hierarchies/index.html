<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I always get scared when I see people trying to organize the Internet into hierarchies</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I always get scared when I see people propose building neat little “hierarchically organized” taxonomies of something that is, well, a web. I think these are people who get their kicks out of having all their shoes lined up neatly in front of the doorstep, sorted alphabetically by designer. “Hey, let’s classify all the blogs so we can have a Microsoft\Technologies\IT\Desktop\.NET Framework\User Interface\WinFX\Color Management\Printing node that all the <i>WinFX printer color management on desktop-class machines for IT managers</i> blogs can be listed under.”
 All zero of them.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/"> Larry Osterman’s popular blog</a> which is “a bunch of random technical stuff, sometimes current, sometimes historical, with a few programming puzzles thrown in” doesn’t fit anywhere. </p>
