<p> It’s the end of September, which means that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/28/775447.aspx"> once again</a>, it’s time for <a href="http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/museumday/"> Smithsonian Magazine’s annual Museum Day</a>, so <a href="http://content.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/"> search for a participating museum near you</a> and <a href="http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/museumday/articles/card.php"> get your free admission card</a>. </p>
<p> One of the participating museums is the <a href="http://www.seattlehistory.org/"> Museum of History &amp; Industry</a>, known to locals by its initials, MOHAI. Whenever I go past the museum and see the big MOHAI banners, I think to myself how great it would be if they opened a satellite location in, say, Renton. That museum would be called the <i>Museum of History &amp; Industry, Renton</i>, or <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_762506451/Mohair.html"> <i>MOHAIR</i></a> for short. </p>
