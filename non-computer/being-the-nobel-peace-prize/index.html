<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Being the Nobel Peace Prize</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         For Hallowe’en this year, I’m going to be <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/">the         Nobel Peace Prize</a>. (I like being things that people would never         even think of as a possible Hallowe’en costume. Last year, I was an inter-office envelope.         People addressed me from place to place.)      </p>
<p>         I chose the Nobel Peace Prize in part because I’m studying Swedish so I thought it         would be fun to be something Swedish.          Except that <a href="http://www.nobel.no/">the Nobel Peace Prize is Norwegian</a>!         Oh, the horror!      </p>
<p>         But what’s done is done. I already made the medal and have started making the diploma,         but I hit a snag: Whose name should be on the Prize?      </p>
<p>         I could go historical and reproduce the <a href="http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/2002/carter-diploma.html">2002         Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Jimmy Carter</a>. (He’s my favorite of the recent Peace         Prize recipients.)      </p>
<p>         Or I could go surreal and create an imaginary award to be bestowed upon Jennifer Lopez         or maybe David Hasselhoff.      </p>
<p>         Or I could just leave the space blank and invite people to nominate a winner.      </p>
<p>         My other problem is making the check for SEK 10,000,000. I asked my friend in Sweden         what a check looks like and he says he’s never seen one. He doesn’t know anybody who         actually writes checks. The closest I could find is <a href="http://www.ssrs.se/2002/sthlmsmassan_donation.htm">this         novelty check</a> but it doesn’t look very convincing. (There’s no bank name or check number, for         example.)  So I’m asking you for help. Can somebody describe what a Swedish check looks like?      </p>
