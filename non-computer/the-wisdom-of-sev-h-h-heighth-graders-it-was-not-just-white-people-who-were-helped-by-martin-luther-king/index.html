<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of sev^H^H^Heighth graders: It was not just white people who were helped by Martin Luther King</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>(Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Day"> the birthday of the famed civil rights leader</a>, the first time since 2001 that the federal holiday coincides with the correct historical date. It seemed an auspicious date to return to the time machine essay.)
 The eighth grade students were given the same in-class writing assignment as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/04/1205832.aspx"> the seventh graders, with the same ground rules</a>, I took two days off from work to help read those essays like I did with the seventh grade essays. (What can I say. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/17/834923.aspx"> I volunteer for strange things</a>.)
 When I started reading the essays, I immediately noticed the difference one year makes in the quality of writing. The eighth grade essays are better put-together, the ideas more fully fleshed-out. But that doesn’t mean that every single essay is a work of art. Here are selections from some essays that one might call the whey of the crop.
 <b>Introductions</b>
 It’s clear that these students have been taught the importance of having an introduction that establishes the topic of the essay. But some students have taken the formula a bit too literally.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this letter I will tell you where, when, and why I would go. </li>
<li>Come join me in my adventure of words as I explain where I go,     when I would go and why I would go there. </li>
<li>You explained to me earlier that I had to write you     a multi-paragraph letter to you explaining where,     when and why I would like to go. Here it goes. </li>
<li>Well I am writing you this to tell you. </li>
</ul>
<p> It doesn’t hurt to flatter the teacher.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to say, this is probably your hugest success     in your history of teaching here at X Middle School. </li>
<li>Wow. You created a time machine. How’d you do that? </li>
<li>An unaccountable amount of thanks!  Sincerely X </li>
<li>Your going to love the time machine I built, it’s     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="one">     on</span>     of a kind!     [This student is clearly management material,     taking credit for somebody else’s work.] </li>
</ul>
<p> Other students took the opportunity to reflect on the nature of the time machine itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have longed to do this traveling trip for some time. </li>
<li>I cannot possibly express my feelings of joy through paper! </li>
<li>I think thirteen years old,     is too young to have such an     <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/incredulous">     incredulous</a> offer thrown upon you. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>A sense of scale</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I would want to go to about 200 B.C.     where all of the dinosaurs weren’t that vicious. </li>
<li>On TV they have shows that show how the 80s were.     These shows are a lot better then my     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="parents'">     parents</span> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="stories">     storys</span>. </li>
<li>If my science teacher gave me a time machine     I will go back in time to the 1800s.     Why? Because it will show me more things that my dad and mom went through. </li>
<li>It would be Washington D.C. in the year 3006…     we might have a new president. </li>
<li>[At age 25]     I would hopefully be out of the house by then- &amp;     would finally be able to drive </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>People from the past were so stupid</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This is an ideal choice for me because cavemen are stupid,     and there are all kinds of ways to control and manipulate idiots. </li>
<li>The treasures my cavemen servants would bring me would be spectacular. </li>
<li>With the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="knowledge">     knologe</span> that I have now even at 14     I am smarter than most of the people in England [in the year 1200]. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Travelling to the past</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Could you bring people back from the dead?     If you could I would get the greatest     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="minds">     mines</span>. </li>
<li>… but to see everybody dressed like this,     I think I might pass out of bad fashion disease. </li>
<li>But most of their dresses are just     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="downright">     down right</span>     poofy!     And sometimes I wonder how they walk in them. </li>
<li>The most exciting event to see would be the     writing of the Mayflower Compact. </li>
<li>… head to the colonies about 1600-1700’s. …     I would show off the hover skate board &amp; hover bike,     &amp; try to convince them that I am a new born god. </li>
<li>I will need to find the time of day that he     [Abraham Lincoln] died so I can properly time my     <u>heroic halting</u> of <u>historic events</u>. </li>
<li>…     until Hitler committed     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="suicide">     sucide</span> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="which">     wich</span> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="obviously">     oveyosley</span> led to his downfall.     [Not many people recover from suicide.] </li>
<li>First, many items and services that are now     excruciatingly overpriced were a bargain back in the 1950’s. </li>
<li>She made them write their names on a     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="paper">     puper</span>. </li>
<li>But in the 1950’s some of the greatest musicians of all time     were creating a cornucopia of music created with mastery and skill.     [Well, a cornucopia is technically a horn…] </li>
<li>And it was not just white people who were helped by Martin Luther King! </li>
<li>I’ve only heard     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="about">     abaout</span>     what [my parents] wore to school and it doesn’t sound too good!     [I doubt they think much of what you wear to school either, sweetie.] </li>
<li>In the 70’s they had great bands such as     <a href="http://www.pearljam.com/">     Pearl Jan</a>,     <a href="http://www.beatles.com/">     The Beatles</a>,     <a href="http://www.acdcrocks.com/">     AC/DC</a>, and     <a href="http://www.islandrecords.com/bonjovi/">     Bon Jovi</a>.     [One out of four ain’t bad.] </li>
<li>My hope on this adventure is to learn the correct way to dance the disco.     This is because now I only know that you point your finger in the air     and shake your booty. </li>
<li>The     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Titanic">     Titantic</span>     first set sail in 1979. </li>
<li>I would go to Dr. Stephen Hawking because I could help him improve his work.     [With your help, he might become smart.] </li>
<li>To us right now, $2.86 per lb. of gas is a lot. </li>
<li>I never got to do any of these things with [my grandmother],     let alone see her; which was nearly every 1 or 2 years.     [This is a meaning of the word “never” with which I was previously     unfamiliar.] </li>
<li>I will visit the famous     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="British Museum">     Britch Mussium</span> when I visit London. </li>

<li>Maybe the robots will feel oppressed and grab torches     and pick forks and run all the humans out of town… or the planet! </li>
<li>I would go to the year 3000 because 3000 seems like a futury time. </li>
<li>[visiting one future self] What if I get job or even killed! </li>
<li>Sadly, my house will be     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="torn">     turn</span>     down and rebuilt for richer people to live in. </li>
<li>I imagine new sports like a sport that combines every sport     into one huge sport.     [What about     <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/">     the sport that includes all sports that don’t include     themselves</a>?] </li>
<li>Later as the years pass people will be teleported to school or work. </li>

</ul>
<p> <b>Religious-themed</b></p>

<li>I would like to see the Last Supper if I can get in! </li>

<li>I would go to     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Jerusalem">     Herisalem</span>     one month before the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Crucifixion">     Crusaification</span>     of Christ.     The reason I would go     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="to">     the</span>     Jerusalem,     would be to stop the greatest sin man has ever made.     [In other words, you want to destroy the foundation of your religion.] </li>
</ul>
