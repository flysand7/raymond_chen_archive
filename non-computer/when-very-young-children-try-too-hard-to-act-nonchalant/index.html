<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When very young children try too hard to act nonchalant</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Apropos of nothing (but perhaps filed as an addendum to the “stories from school” category), I was reminded of a story from the aftermath of the <a href="http://maximus.ce.washington.edu/~nisqually/"> Nisqually Earthquake</a> that struck Seattle in 2001. Mind you, this story is fourth-hand by now, but it’s still cute.
 A young student, whom I will call “Billy”, returned from school the day of the earthquake (which struck in mid-morning).
 Billy: “Hi, Mom. I’m home.”
 Mom: “Hi, Billy. Anything interesting happen at school today?”
 Billy: (trying to sound nonchalant) “Nothing much.”
 Mom: “What about the earthquake?”
 Billy: (surprised) “Who told you about the earthquake?!”</p>
<p> Update: Corrected Mom’s question. And I deleted all the comments arguing about religion. If you want to debate child rearing, do it somewhere else. </p>
