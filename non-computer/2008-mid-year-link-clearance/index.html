<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">2008 mid-year link clearance</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Time for the semi-annual link clearance.</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ft.com/comment/columnists/lucykellaway">     Lucy Kellaway</a>     campaigns against management jargon.     Last November, she     <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3cb5f0fa-8965-11dc-b52e-0000779fd2ac.html">     railed against</a>     a phrase     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/25/5108967.aspx">     I too had ridiculed</a>:     <i>going forward</i>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/11/going-forward.html">     Scott Adams blogs about going forward</a>.     I found it fascinating that of the four ways he thought blogging would     be rewarding, only the last one held true.     And I can definitely feel for the predicament     that every blog post reduced his income. </li>
<li>     So you’re ordering something from     <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">     Amazon</a>     and you’re just a smidge short of the $25 necessary to get     free shipping.     You could either fork over the $8 for shipping or use the     <a href="http://www.filleritem.com/">     Amazon Filler Item Finder</a>     to find something (like say a pack of batteries for 87 cents)     that will get you free shipping. </li>
<li>     So you’re bidding on an item on     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">     eBay</a>     and the seller has a 99.5% feedback rating (which by some     people’s reckoning is “barely acceptable”),     and you want to see what those five negative comments were,     because if they were just weenie complaints,     then you’ll bid on the item.     Since it’s hard to find those negative feedback items via eBay’s     interface, you can turn to the     <a href="http://toolhaus.org/cgi-bin/negs">     eBay negative/neutral feedback finder</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004146747_apmissingcameraquest26.html">     The forensics of trying to reunite a digital camera with its owner     based solely on the photos found inside it</a>. </li>
<li>     The <i>New York Times</i> finds     <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/dining/23sushi.html">     uncomfortably high mercury levels in tuna from several     New York sushi restaurants</a>.     The response from Japan:     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004145242_apjapantaintedtuna25.html">     Meh</a>. </li>
<li>     It opened during the cold part of the year,     but now that the weather is nice, you can visit the new     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003982605_fremontpark30m.html">     Fremont Peak Park</a>.     And while you’re there, stop by some restaurants I like,     such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/27/7912127.aspx"> <i>The Asteroid</i></a>     and     <i>Blue C Sushi</i>     (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/logistics/2007/05/23/logistics-restaurants-biz-logistics-cx_rm_0523sushi.html">powered by RFID</a>¹),     because sushi tastes better when it’s moving on a conveyer belt. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.atlarge.com/">atlarge.com</a>     tracks free WiFi access points at airports around the world. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/philfactor/archive/2008/01/27/43174.aspx">     A dead-on parody of Microsoft PR-speak</a>. </li>

<p> And, as always, the obligatory plug for my column in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/"> TechNet Magazine</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc137733.aspx">     Remind Me Never to Do That Again</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc194424.aspx">     Scrapping the Scraps</a>. </li>

<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc462815.aspx">     16-bit Icons Are So Passé</a>.     The title (and blurb) play a bit loose with terminology for the sake     of brevity.     The 16-bitness refers to the bitness of the module to which the     icon is attached, not to the icon color depth.     We apologize for any confusion this may have caused. </li>
<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc510335.aspx">     The Two Worst PCs Ever</a>.     This article was teased as     “Raymond Chen     <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc510382.aspx">     fondly reminisces</a>     about working with the two worst computers ever made.”     This is a lie.     The reminiscence is not fond. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p> ¹Yes, it isn’t literally powered by RFID. I was spoofing marketing-speak. I apologize to those for whom this did not require explaining. </p>
