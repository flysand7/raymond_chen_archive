<p>“<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16628918">The marijuana is grown in the middle of some very respectable Seattle suburbs, such as Renton</a>.”
 This is a funny sentence if you’re a longtime resident of the greater Seattle area, because Renton has historically been a working-class town. (Here’s <i>Almost Live</i>‘s <a href="http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_womenmag.wmv"> parody of South King County</a> to give you an idea of what Renton is up against.)</p>
<p> The city is <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=renton01m&amp;date=20060601"> working to change its reputation</a>. I wish them luck. </p>
