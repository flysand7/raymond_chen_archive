<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Swedes struggle with the meaning of sick leave</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As part of the continuing campaign to shed their hard-working stereotype, perhaps <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/27/198411.aspx"> taking a cue from their more well-adjusted Norwegian neighbors</a>, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20040917/od_nm/sweden_sickness_dc"> Swedes have been taking dubious sick leave in record numbers</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  [A] study showed 40 percent believe it is enough to feel tired to stay home and draw benefits.  </p>
<p> A survey of 1,002 Swedes by the board also showed 65 percent believed they could go on sick leave if they felt stressed at work and 41 percent thought a conflict with their boss or workmates was a good enough reason.  </p>
<p> One fifth thought a strike at the child care center also made them eligible for the benefits and 71 percent said family problems entitled them always or sometimes to sick leave. </p>

<p> Reuters claims <i><a href="http://www.dn.se/">Dagens Nyheter</a></i> as the source, but if you punch “Anna Hedborg” into DN:s search engine, asking for articles within the last week, it finds nothing. But if you ask Google, the article is right there: <i><a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=320915">Trötta sjukskriver sig</a></i> (<i>The tired call in sick</i>). Once again, Google finds a web page that the site itself cannot. </p>
<p> On a somewhat related note, <a href="http://www.sr.se/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=473711"> a different type of sick-leave abuse has been detected</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  According to the Social Insurance Board, several people  have been drawing sick-leave pay for several years, while simultaneously working another job and receiving unemployment benefits. </p>
<p> Some cases are of ordinary people who defraud the Board in small amounts but over a long period of time. In the other cases, there are links to serious economic crime where, for example, money was paid out to fictitious employees at nonexistent companies. </p>
