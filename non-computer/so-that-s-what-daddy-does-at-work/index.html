<p>As <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/craigrow/archive/2005/10/31/487338.aspx"> many</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/10/28/486196.aspx"> people</a> <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/moreart/Blog/cns!1pIz5aFkXvQrzU7qNE_NyxCA!789.entry"> have</a> <a href="http://www.gavinshearer.com/weblog/archives/2005/10/munchkin_invasi.html"> pointed out</a>, Hallowe’en at Microsoft is a very family-oriented affair. The parents love it because the kids are in a safe environment; the kids love it because instead of having to go from house to house, you just have to walk to the next office, and then there’s a big party in the cafeteria afterwards.
 Though it does lead to some misconceptions on the part of the younger children, the result of extrapolation from too few data points. I remember a colleague of mine who brought his young daughter to work for Hallowe’en. A conversation with “Cathy” some days later went like this:
 “Hi, Cathy.”
 “Hi.”
 “Do you know where your daddy works?”
 “He works at Microsoft.”
 “Do you know what your daddy does at work?”</p>
<p> “He walks around and gets candy.” </p>
