<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Changes to the the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season, part 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The Seattle Symphony made a large number of changes to their 2009/2010 program line-up. I’ve updated <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx"> the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance</a> accordingly. </p>
<p> The Brahms <i>Variations on a Theme by Hadyn</i>, the Brahms/Schoenberg Piano Quartet in g minor, and the Shostakovich Symphony #15 moved to different dates, and a large number of substitutions or single-piece additions/subtractions were made. The concert for the week of October 30 was cancelled outright; ticket-holders will be issued tickets for the week of May 6 instead. </p>
