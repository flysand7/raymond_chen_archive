<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do some comments have a star?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Every so often, someone posts a really funny comment, and I feel stupid just posting the remark “Haha, that was funny” or even worse “LOL”. So I’m going to try giving them a star instead.

<p> Hopefully people won’t post comments just fishing for a star. (I realize that this is a vain hope and that I will probably have to cancel the star program within the week.) </p>
