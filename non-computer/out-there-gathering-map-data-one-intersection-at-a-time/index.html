<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Out there gathering map data, one intersection at a time</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/"><i>The New Yorker</i></a> reported some time ago on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060424fa_fact"> how Navteq gathers map data</a>. This story reminded me that, at least as of a few years ago, Navteq listed the driveway of a colleague of mine as a through road. Drivers came up to his driveway, realized that they’ve been hoodwinked, and spun their wheels in the gravel in frustration on their way out. </p>
<p> He told me that he had reported the error to Navteq three years previously, but they still hadn’t updated their map data. I haven’t checked back to see if the data has been updated yet… </p>
