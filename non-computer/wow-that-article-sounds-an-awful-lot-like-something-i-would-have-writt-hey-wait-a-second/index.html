<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Wow, that article sounds an awful lot like something I would have writt… hey, wait a second</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer (via their customer liaison) had a question about the meaning of the lock overlay icon. Another colleague responded with <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/the-overlay-icons-in-windows-7" rel="nofollow"> a link to a site that contained an explanation</a>. </p>
<p>I read the linked article and thought to myself, “Wow, that article sounds an awful lot like something I would have written.” The style of the writing is similar to mine, and the phrases “Given the changes in how people use computers”, “visual clutter”, and “the value … diminishes” particularly struck me. </p>
<p>And it turns out the reason it sounded so familiar was that in fact <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091209-00/?p=15723">was something I had written</a>. I wrote my article in 2009, and the plagiarized article came out in 2010. </p>
<p>My colleague apologized. “I realized that I should have searched your blog first. The link I posted was the leading search result on both Bing and Google.” </p>
<p>Great. My original content loses to the site that scrapes my content. I must be doing this wrong. </p>
<p>(This was before they migrated the blog to the new server, so don’t blame the migration for the poor search ranking.) </p>
