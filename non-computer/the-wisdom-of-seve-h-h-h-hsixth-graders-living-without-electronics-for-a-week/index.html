<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The wisdom of seve^H^H^H^Hsixth graders: Living without electronics for a week</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sixth grade students (ages 11 to 12, roughly) were instructed to imagine that they have no television, computer, or telephone for a week and write an essay (in the form of a letter to their parents) on what they would do with their time and why. The assignment was given under standardized test conditions: 90 minutes with nothing but pencil and paper, with an additional hour available upon request. (In practice, few students ask for the extra hour.)
 Remember, these are only the funny sentences/excerpts. Do not assume that all students write like this.
 <b>Stage One: Denial</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A powerman came to our house and is trying to fix the     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="precious">precios</span> <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="valuables">valubles</span>…     <i>But don’t touch the family jewels.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Two: Anger</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Since you have forcefully restricted me from using     <span style="cursor: default;border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="essential">essenchal</span>,     electronics like the TV… </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Three: Bargaining</b>
 (couldn’t find an example, sorry)
 <b>Stage Four: Depression</b></p>
<ul>
<li>My heart is full of grief and sadness,     yet I regret nothing but the loss of my precious x-box. </li>
<li>Although I am in a mood of melancholy over this gloomy oncoming event,     I hope my hobbies will cheer me up.     <i>Big words sound bigger.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Five: Acceptance</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Since you have grounded me for a week, I need to nurture my growing sense of fun. </li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p> <b>I’m not resentful. Why do you ask?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Sincerely, Your Daughter, the Formerly Loved. </li>
</ul>
<p> Observe that many students talked about “the last thing” they would do. This is another consequence of adhering too close to formula. “I have three things, so I will say ‘The first thing’, ‘The next thing’, and ‘the last thing’.” They don’t realize that when you write “The last thing I will do”, it carries a somewhat different meaning.</p>
