<p>One of our researchers IM’d me yesterday to let me know that someone she interviewed mentioned that some people suspected that I wasn’t real because most of my posts are published at the same time every day.</p>
<p> I dunno. The evening news comes on at the same time every day, but I’m pretty sure they’re real. Maybe I should be more suspicious. </p>
<p> If I were real. </p>
