<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Does anybody actually like Brazil nuts?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Brazil nuts are perhaps best known for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_nut_effect"> floating to the top of a jar of mixed nuts</a>. According to Wikipedia,¹ the reason for the phenomenon is not well understood.
 At least in my house, the reason for the phenomenon is quite clear: Brazil nuts float to the top because nobody in my house likes Brazil nuts. When you reach in and grab a handful of nuts, you toss the Brazil nuts back into the jar, which is why they end up on top.
 A few months ago, I asked “Does anybody actually like Brazil nuts?” A lot of people agreed with my opinion of them, but there was a notable dissenter: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman"> Larry Osterman</a>. There is now a symbiotic relationship between my family and Larry Osterman. Every so often, I will skim off the Brazil nuts and bring them to Larry. Both sides win: We get rid of the annoying Brazil nuts, and Larry gets a small bag of Brazil nuts.</p>
<p> ¹ Translation: I could just as well be making this up. </p>
