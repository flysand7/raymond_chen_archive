<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Most people who go to an open house aren't actually interested in buying it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> You have a house for sale. You hold an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Open_house"> open house</a>. But not everybody who attends is there because they’re interested in buying the house. The first wave are neighbors who are curious about the house they’ve seen for years only from the outside. Then there are the people who just enjoy looking at other people’s houses. And occasionally, people drop by <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/realestate/2004005173_openhouses11.html"> looking for chicken wings</a>.</p>
