<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you’re at a Thai restaurant with a Thai person who’s ordering food in Thai, and she asks you if you like your food spicy, think twice before answering</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I think you see where this is going.</p>
<p> I’m <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/04/8923201.aspx"> at a Thai restaurant</a> with my sister-in-law, who is Thai. She’s talking with the waitress in Thai, and she discovers that the restaurant’s cook is someone she knows. And since she’s from Thailand, she assumes the task of ordering the food, since she knows what’s good and what isn’t. </p>
<p> During their conversation (entirely in Thai, so I don’t understand a word of it), she turns to me and asks, “So, is spicy food okay?” </p>
<p> I say, “Yeah, I like spicy food.” </p>
<p> Classic rookie mistake. </p>
<p> I think that by the end of the meal, I had just started to regain the ability to taste the food. </p>
<p> Happy birthday, P—! And you’ll be relieved to know that I can taste food again. </p>
