<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I challenge you to come up with an even lamer physics pun</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The other day, I was in the office kitchenette, and two of my colleagues both named Paul happened to be there getting coffee. I quipped, “Oh no, is this legal? I think it’s a violation of the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html"> Paul Exclusion Principle</a>.”
 It was a horrible physics pun, perhaps one of the worst I’ve made in a long time. My challenge to you is to come up with an even worse one that you’ve told.</p>
<p> Note: You have to have actually made the pun to an appropriate audience. No fair just making one up for the purpose of the challenge. </p>
