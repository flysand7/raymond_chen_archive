<p>If you lived in the New York metropolitan area in the 1980’s, you couldn’t avoid the advertisements for electronics store <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eddie"> Crazy Eddie</a>. What I didn’t realize until now was that the retail establishment <a href="http://www.theticker.org/2.10632/not-so-crazy-eddie-1.1415828"> was a criminal operation from day one</a>. Sam Antar, Crazy Eddie CFO, and nephew of company namesake Eddie Antar, talks us through the entire operation <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/08/into_the_mind_of_a_financial_c.html"> in this riveting interview</a>. Along the way, you’ll learn why it was at first advantageous to under-report revenues, then later why it became advantageous to return the unreported money back to the system.
