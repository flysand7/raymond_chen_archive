<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Ha ha, the speaker gift is a speaker, get it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>As a thank-you for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/22/10041191.aspx"> presenting at TechReady11</a>, the conference organizers gave me (and presumably the other speakers) a portable speaker with the Windows logo printed on it.
 The speaker underneath the logo is the <a href="http://www.x-mini.com/online-shop?page=shop.product_details&amp;category_id=1&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=5"> X-Mini II Capsule Speaker</a>, and I have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stevecla01/archive/2010/08/15/mini-speaker.aspx"> agree with Steve Clayton</a> that they pack a lot of sound in a compact size. Great for taking on trips, or even picnics.
 It’s been a long time since I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/31/684106.aspx"> last recommended a Christmas gift for geeks</a>, so maybe I’ll make up for it by giving two suggestions this year.
 The second suggestion is a response to a comment from that old article: My bicycle lock is just a laptop combination lock that I repurposed as a bicycle lock. It’s a pretty clumsy design for a laptop lock, since <a href="http://dealsproshop.auctivacommerce.com/Laptop-Lock-with-retractable-cable-and-safe-combination-P611913.aspx"> it comes in two parts, one of which is easy to lose</a>, but if you just “accidentally” lose the clip part, what’s left is a simple cable combination lock that easily tucks into a side pocket of my bicycle trunk bag. Yes, that lock isn’t going to stop a dedicated thief for very long, but fortunately, the Microsoft parking garage is not crawling with dedicated thieves because, as a rule, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/26/9928892.aspx#9929126"> Microsoft tries not to hire dishonest people</a>.</p>
<p> So, um, that’s a suggestion for a bicycle lock for somebody who lives in a low-crime area. Hm, maybe that’s not a very good suggestion after all. </p>
