<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I can't believe they actually can't think of a name for the recent storm</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Seattle Times reports that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003490012_stormname22m.html"> the National Weather Service is inviting suggestions from the public on what to call the recent windstorm</a>. They’re baffled because “the storm didn’t fall on a holiday.”
 Huh?
 The storm blew in on the evening of the 14th, but its effects weren’t really felt until the morning of the 15th, and the first dark night for everyone was… <i>the first night of Hanukkah</i>, the Festival of Lights. Everybody in the Seattle area was lighting candles and celebrating Hanukkah (mostly unwittingly).
 Gosh, I wonder what we should call this storm? If you have any ideas, send your suggestion to namethewindstorm@noaa.gov.</p>
<p> (By the way, in case you missed it, here’s the picture of <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2003480656.html"> the house that had ten trees fall on it</a>.) </p>
