<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">British newspapers are much more fun to read</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         You can always count on <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> for         a snarky take on the day’s technology news. Today’s favorite is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/33974.html">this         “review” of the nTAG</a>, which ends with      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Well, we think that any sane person would have to held at gunpoint     to induce them to carry an electronic device which, besides containing personal or     other information which is transmitted wirelessly, can also be tracked by event organisers     and makes the wearer look like a complete muppet. We could be wrong, of course. </p></blockquote>
<p> Even more mainstream papers like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a> can develop quite an attitude. They recently <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1081296,00.html">ridiculed the furore over that thing that everybody is talking about but the courts have forbidden the press from reporting on</a>. My favorite is still this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4173226,00.html">list of things we don’t miss</a>. I don’t understand three quarters of it but I don’t care; it’s still a riot. </p>
<p> Why are newspapers in the States so stodgy? The only wild goofiness in a major paper I can think of offhand is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/style/columns/styleinvitational/">Washington Post Style Invitational</a>, but they wouldn’t dare let any of this infect their “serious” news… </p>
