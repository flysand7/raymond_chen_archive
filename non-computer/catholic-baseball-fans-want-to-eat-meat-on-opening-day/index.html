<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Catholic baseball fans want to eat meat on opening day</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>So it happens that Opening Day of the baseball season  coincides with Good Friday,  a day of “fasting and abstinence” according to Catholic tradition.  (Then again, after Vatican II, the definition of “fasting and  abstinence” weakened significantly. All that most people remember  any more is “no meat”.)
  Catholics in Boston have applied to the archdiocese for a  special dispensation so they can have a hot dog at the game.  The Church said  “<a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2004/03/12/church_nixes_good_friday_fenway_hot_dogs/">Nice try</a>“.</p>
