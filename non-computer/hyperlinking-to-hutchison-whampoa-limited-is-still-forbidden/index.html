<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hyperlinking to Hutchison Whampoa Limited is still forbidden</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in 2005, I noted that <a href="/other/hyperlinking-to-hutchison-whampoa-limited-forbidden" title="Hyperlinking to Hutchison Whampoa Limited forbidden"> since 2000, Hutchison Whampoa Limited required written permission to create a hyperlink to their Web site without written permission</a>.</p>
<p>This requirement appears still to be in effect. If you go to their Web site and click the “Copyright” link at the bottom, you are told</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>No person, whether an individual or a body corporate, shall create or establish a hyperlink to the HWL Corporate Website by hypertext reference or imaging without the written permission of Hutchison.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2015, Hutchison Whampoa Limited was merged with Cheung Kong Holdings, forming CK Hutchison Holdings. Surely, when they set up the Web site for the new company, they updated their copyright statement to be something more in keeping with today’s Internet-connected world, right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>If you go to the home page of CK Hutchison Holdings and click on the “Copyright” link at the bottom, it takes you to a page which concludes with the paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>No person, whether an individual or a body corporate, shall create or establish a hyperlink to the CK Hutchison Corporate Website by hypertext reference or imaging without the written permission of CK Hutchison.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder whether anyone has successfully obtained written permission to hyperlink to the CK Hutchison Corporate Web site. I personally have not, which is why I am not hyperlinking to them.</p>
