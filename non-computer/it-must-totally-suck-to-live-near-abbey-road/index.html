<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It must totally suck to live near Abbey Road</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I feel sorry for the people who live near Abbey Road or who have to take that road as part of their daily routine, because <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/18/tourists-reenacting.html"> tourists keep blocking traffic to recreate the cover of the eponymous Beatles album</a>.
 <a href="http://www.abbeyroad.com/Crossing/"> The recording studio has a webcam on the intersection</a> so you can watch the mayhem as it happens.</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Just this morning, I checked out the webcam and within two minutes, another group of tourists posed in the zebra crossing. </p>
