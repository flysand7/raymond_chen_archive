<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The truth about 4/29 the government doesn't want you to know</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> With <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/02/4179108.aspx"> the loss of the <i>Weekly World News</i></a>, I’ll have to rely on the trustworthy Internet to keep me informed of government conspiracies. I happen to be partial to <a href="http://www.429truth.com/"> 4/29truth.com</a>, which uncovers the strange coincidences and inconsistencies in the “official” explanation of the <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/29/BAGVOPHQU46.DTL"> tanker crash and fire on April 29, 2007</a> that destroyed a highway overpass in the San Francisco Bay Area. (This site is so noteworthy, even <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/politicalmuscle/2007/05/seeking_the_tru.html"> <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> sang its praises</a>.) </p>
<p> My favorite factoid: The only way Governor Schwarzenneger could have gotten to the scene in time <a href="http://www.429truth.com/archives/7"> was if he was already en route when the explosion occurred</a>, proving that the explosion was no accident. </p>
