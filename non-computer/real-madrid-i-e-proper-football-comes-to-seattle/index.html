<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Real Madrid (i.e., proper football) comes to Seattle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Hot off the presses. Real Madrid (with David Beckham, Ronaldo, and other stars) <a href="http://www.seattlesounders.net/pressrelease.php?ID=497"> will play an exhibition match against D. C. United</a> in Seah^H^H^H^HQuest Field on Wednesday, August 9th. I wonder if it’ll be anything like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/26/197065.aspx"> the last soccer match I saw</a>. At least let’s hope they’re ready to play instead of <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20060725/1653232.shtml"> having tired themselves out playing video games</a>. </p>
<p> Tickets go on sale today. </p>
