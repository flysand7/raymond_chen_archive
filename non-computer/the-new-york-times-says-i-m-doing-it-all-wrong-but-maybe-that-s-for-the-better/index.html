<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The New York Times says I'm doing it all wrong, but maybe that's for the better</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, <i>The New York Times</i> ran a story titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/technology/06sweat.html"> <i>In Web World of 24/7 Stress, Writers Blog Till They Drop</i></a>, which mentions that “those on the lower rungs of the business can earn as little as $10 a post.”
 Dude, if that’s what people on the lower rungs earn, then I’m below ground level! (Nevermind that just the previous month, an article in <i>The New York Times</i> wrote about the business of blogging: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/technology/personaltech/20basics.html"> Don’t expect to get rich</a>.)
 Then again, I probably shouldn’t complain, seeing as what most people took away from the article was that <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2008/04/blogging_kills_1.html"> blogging kills</a>.</p>
<p> <i>Slate</i>‘s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Noah"> Timothy Noah</a> noted in his article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2188424/"> <i>Death by Blogging</i></a> that the <i>New York Times</i> article employs a magic phrase which, once it appears, is a signal to the reader that the subject matter of the story is completely made up: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Give Richtel credit for admitting high up in the story that what follows is purest fancy. Newspaper reporters call these caveat-rich passages “to-be-sure grafs.” </p></blockquote>
<p> The “to-be-sure” paragraph appears as paragraph number six: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <u>To be sure</u>, there is <u>no official diagnosis</u> of death by blogging, and the premature demise of two people <u>obviously does not</u> qualify as an epidemic. There is also <u>no certainty</u> that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths. <u>But</u>… </p></blockquote>
<p> It opens with the magic phrase that says “What you are reading in the remainder of this article is complete fantasy,” then adds a few more statements saying that “None of what this article says is true.” And then, as if to say, “Let’s not let facts get in the way of a good story,” it immediately resumes the fabrication with a “But…” </p>
