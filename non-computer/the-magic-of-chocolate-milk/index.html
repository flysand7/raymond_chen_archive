<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The magic of chocolate milk</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> While enjoying a meal with my nieces (at the time, ages 3 and 5), I diluted my chocolate milk to cut the sweetness. The nieces then demanded that I dilute their chocolate milk as well, because as far as they could determine, it was <i>a magical way to create more chocolate milk</i>.</p>
