<p>No, this is not my attempt to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$h*!_My_Dad_Says">picked up as a television show</a>. It’s just that my father-in-law sometimes says funny stuff. </p>
<p>When my mother came to visit, she brought some bread that she had made in a bread-making machine. The conversation went something like this: </p>
<p>Father-in-law: “Wow, this bread is really good. Maybe we should get a bread-making machine.” </p>
<p>Mom: “It’s really easy to do. You just measure the ingredients, put them in the machine, and push the button. Three hours later, you have fresh bread!” </p>
<p>Father-in-law: “Three hours? After three hours I might not still be hungry!” </p>
