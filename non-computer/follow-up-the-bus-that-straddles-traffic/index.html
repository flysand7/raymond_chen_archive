<p>In 2010, the world was amazed at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/straddling-bus-coming-to-america/">traffic-straddling bus</a>, whose inventors announced plans to begin work “as soon as 2011”. </p>
<p>And then the world forgot about this invention that left them so breathless just moments ago. </p>
<p>And then, in 2016, the world was amazed at the <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/cars/2016/08/china-has-built-a-crazy-elevated-bus-that-straddles-traffic/">traffic-straddling bus</a>, which conceded that it currently just runs “back and forth on a short, straight stretch of road.” </p>
<p>And then the world forgot about this invention that left them so breathless just moments ago. </p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-china-straddling-bus-2016-story.html">traffic-straddling bus</a> is sitting abandoned over half of a four-lane road. Shortly after the announcement in 2016, the company was accused of swindling its investors. The company stopped answering the phone. The office doors are locked. </p>
<p>I wonder if the world will be amazed by their next promotional video. </p>
