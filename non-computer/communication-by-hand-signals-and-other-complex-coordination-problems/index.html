<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Communication by hand signals, and other complex coordination problems</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in 1944, <a href="http://www.life.com/">LIFE Magazine</a> ran a series of photos showing some of the <a href="http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2009/03/02/hand-signals-at-the-stork-club/">hand signals used by club owner Sherman Billingsley</a> to communicate with his staff while he schmoozed with a customer. </p>
<p>In a similar vein, the general manager of Eleven Madison Park <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/10/02/opinion/sunday/201110 02_Schott_Sign_Dining.html"> demonstrates some hand signals used in his fancy restaurant</a>. </p>
<p>I’m fascinated by hand signals and more generally the mechanisms by which complex processes are coordinated, particularly the subtle mechanisms that customers never notice. </p>
<p>For example, when I visit a casino, I like to hang out near the craps table, not because I enjoy the game itself, but because I enjoy watching how the people who manage the table keep track of dozens of bets simultaneously. </p>
