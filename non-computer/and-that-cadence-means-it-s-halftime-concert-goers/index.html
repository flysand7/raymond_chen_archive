<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">And… that cadence means it's halftime, concert-goers!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In college, one of my classmates (who is now the conductor of an orchestra, so I guess that whole music thing worked out for him) coined the term <i>halftime</i> to refer to a resounding cadence in the first half of a piece, the type of cadence that might fool an inattentive or unseasoned listener into thinking that the piece is over, when in fact it’s just getting started. We’re not talking about a false ending, which is comparatively easy to find, but rather a “big finish” when we’re nowhere near the finish.
 <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDio1m1C9s#t=8m10"> big halftime cadence</a>, complete with a reprise of the opening fanfare, at the end of <i>Der Genesende</i>. This was the piece that inspired the coinage of the term.
 <i>Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Z-HCq5EeU#t=6m30s"> quiet halftime cadence</a> (echoing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Z-HCq5EeU#t=6m05s"> big <i>Dies Irae</i> just a few seconds earier)</a> in variation XX.
 Schubert’s <i>Trout Quintet</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZDsQVsEmEg#t=3m"> halftime cadence in the precise center of the final movement</a>. Warning listeners about it <a href="http://www.talkclassical.com/8641-fun-ironic-endings-cadenzas.html#post92652"> doesn’t help</a>.
 The first movement of <i>Mahler’s Second Symphony</i> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6idPaGqvV8#t=15m35s"> a massive halftime cadence</a>. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWQeLep7QE#t=8m20s">Super sideburns version</a>.) The piece closed Gerard Schwarz’s final concert (for nitpickers: Schwarz’s final regular-season concert as music director of the Seattle Symphony), and when the halftime cadence was reached, I heard scattered applause through the hall. Which told me a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>The people who attended that concert were not     regular concert-goers.     Another cue was that people were far more nattily-dressed     than your average Seattle Symphony crowd,     and we were in the third tier!     (Now, I don’t normally sit in the third tier,     so who knows, maybe the third-tier crowd is the dress-up crowd.) </li>
<li>The people who applauded under the mistaken impression that     the piece was over were in for a big disappointment,     since there was another hour to go! </li>
</ul>
<p> Can you come up with other examples of <i>halftime</i>?</p>
