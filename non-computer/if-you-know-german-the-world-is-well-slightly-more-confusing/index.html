<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you know German, the world is, well, slightly more confusing</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>While it may be true that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/13/58200.aspx"> if you know Swedish, the world is funnier</a>, I have to admit that my knowledge of German only served to create momentary confusion.
 When I saw the headline that <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article1185332.ece"> the head of BetonSports was arrested</a>, I thought to myself, “Who the heck would have a web site devoted to sports in concrete?” That’s because the German word <a href="http://www.dict.cc/?s=deutsch-englisch:Beton"> <i>Beton</i></a> means “concrete” (the construction material) in English, and the German word <i>Sport</i> means the same as in English.</p>
<p> It took me a few moments to realize that the company’s name is “Bet on Sports”. </p>
