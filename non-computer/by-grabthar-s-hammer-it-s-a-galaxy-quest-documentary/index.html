<p>The science fiction parody <i>Galaxy Quest</i> was a moderate success at the box office when it was released twenty years ago. It subsequently gained a following, particularly among the <i>Star Trek</i> fan community, even earning a place in the voting for “Best Star Trek movie”. (It <a href="https://www.startrek.com/article/star-trek-las-vegas-2013-day-2-recap"> came in seventh</a>.)</p>
<p>“Galaxy Quest is <i>the best</i> Star Trek movie.” — Wil Wheaton</p>
<p>“Why didn’t <i>we</i> do this?” — Brent Spiner</p>
<p>“Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did.” — Patrick Stewart</p>
<p>“For the life of me I was trying to understand who he [Tim Allen] was imitating.” — William Shatner</p>
<p>(Man, I sure hope Shatner had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek.)</p>
<p>And now there’s <i>Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary</i>.</p>
