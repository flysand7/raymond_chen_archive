In our internal blogging discussion mailing list, somebody asked,
“How do you guys manage your blogs?
I mean stuff like revising old posts, managing links, categories, etc.”
</p>
<p>
My reply:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
What specific sort of “management” activities are you trying to do?
Typically, once you post an entry that’s the end of it.
You don’t manage a blog so much as keep feeding it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For some reason, people got a kick out of that last sentence.
