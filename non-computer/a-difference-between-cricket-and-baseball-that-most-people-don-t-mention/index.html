<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A difference between cricket and baseball that most people don’t mention</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I noted that <a href="/non-computer/baseball-the-rules-for-the-casual-viewer"> I would be taking some friends to their first baseball game</a>. They are from Commonwealth countries, so cricket is the bat-and-ball game of choice there. We had fun comparing the two games.</p>
<p>During the game, a spectator ran onto the field and was chased and tackled by security. One of my friends remarked, “That’s another difference between cricket and baseball. In cricket, that guy would have been naked.”</p>
