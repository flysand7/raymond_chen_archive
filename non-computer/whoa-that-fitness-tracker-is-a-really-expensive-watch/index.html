<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Whoa, that fitness tracker is a really expensive watch</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My mom saw that her friend was wearing a new watch. </p>
<p>Her friend said, “It also counts how many steps I took today, keeps track of my exercise, even monitors my sleep.” </p>
<p>My mom replied, “I used to have a watch, but its battery died after only two years! It’s such a hassle replacing the battery.” </p>
<p>Her friend answered, “Oh, you just recharge it every few days. It’s called a FitBit.” </p>
<p>My mom said, “Wow, it recharges. So you never need to replace the watch battery. How much did it cost?” </p>
<p>“Around $150.” </p>
<p>My mom said, “Whoa, that’s a really expensive watch. Mine was only $15.” </p>
<p>Hey mom, you know what else is an even more expensive watch? </p>
<p>A BMW. </p>
