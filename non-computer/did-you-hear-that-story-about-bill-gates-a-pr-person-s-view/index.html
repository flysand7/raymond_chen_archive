<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Did you hear that story about Bill Gates?: A PR person’s view</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I learned from someone who did public relations for Bill and Melinda Gates that they often hear stories of the form, “So I heard from a friend of a friend that their cousin’s hairdresser’s former high school classmate helped out a person who was in a bit of a jam, and the person thanked them and asked for their name. They thought nothing of it, but a week later, they received an expensive thank-you gift. It turns out the person they helped was Bill Gates.”</p>
<p>The story takes many forms. The assistance might be helping to change a flat tire, or paying for his takeout food order after he found himself a bit short of change. And the thank-you gift might be a new car or a paid-off mortgage. The details vary from telling to telling, but the basic shape is the same.</p>
<p>The media person explained, “Whenever somebody tells a story like that, I just say, ‘That sounds like a fun story.’ If it’s true, you don’t want to confirm it, because everybody will expect to get an expensive thank-you gift. And if it’s not true, you just ruined somebody’s fun story.”</p>
<p>They added, “I enjoyed hearing these stories because it gave me insight into what people think about Bill.”</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Bill. Don’t believe all the stories you hear about me.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: What’s actually confirmed true is that Bill <a href="https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/gift-we-take-granted/?linkId=61358037"> participates in Reddit Secret Santa</a>.</p>
