<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Public service announcement for Seattle area taxpayers: Some transit taxes can be itemized and deducted</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you itemize your taxes, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003577419_taxmonorail.html"> there are some taxes you can claim on Schedule A line 7</a> that you may not be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seattle monorail tax (“Monorail”) </li>
<li>Sound Transit tax (“RTA Tax”) </li>
</ul>
<p> These taxes are special because they are based on the value of the vehicle and therefore qualify as a “personal property tax” from the IRS’s point of view.
 While you’re on Schedule A, don’t forget to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=167605,00.html"> claim your deduction for state sales tax on line 5</a>. You can look up the local sales tax rate for any Washington address by using <a href="http://gis.dor.wa.gov/taxratefinder/TaxFinder.htm?TaxType=S"> this handy web form on the State of Washington Department of Revenue</a> site. If you prefer doing it the slow way, you can <a href="http://dor.wa.gov/content/taxes/LocalSales_Use.aspx"> download all the local sales tax rates</a>. If you live in King County†, for example, the local rate is 1.9%, or 2.3% if you live in an RTA area. (That’s in addition to the state-wide 6.5% rate.)
 <b>Nitpicker’s corner</b></p>
<p> †That’s King County, Washington, USA of course. I would have thought that was clear from context (it’s the county that Seattle is a member of, and I’ve been talking about the state of Washington the whole time), but I can never tell with you folks. </p>
