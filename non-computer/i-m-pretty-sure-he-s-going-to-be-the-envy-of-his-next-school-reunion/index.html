<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I'm pretty sure he's going to be the envy of his next school reunion</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Masi Oka has <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/10/71984"> pretty much everything</a> the dorky nerd geek has ever dreamed of.
 Right out of college, he lands a job at Industrial Light and Magic doing digital effects, developing complex algorithms for water and other fluid effects seen in movies like <i>The Perfect Storm</i>. That’d already be enough to make him the hit of his next school reunion.
 And then he scores a major role in the television series <i>Heroes</i> as a, well, dorky nerd geek. But one with a super power. Now at his next school reunion, he’s going to be mobbed by people who wouldn’t even give him the time of day when he was in school.</p>
<p> But wait, there’s more. Now it is rumored that Riyo Mori, the newly-crowned Miss Universe, is being considered for a role on <i>Heroes</i> as “<a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631932,00.html">the love interest of one of the show’s superhero characters</a>.” Given that her character has a Japanese name, it’s not unreasonable to suppose that the superhero in question may be Oka’s character Hiro. If so, and she gets the role, then he’ll not just be an accomplished digital effects artist, not just a prime-time actor, but an actor whose on-screen girlfriend was crowned the most beautiful woman in the world! At his next reunion, Oka’s going to be mobbed by people who didn’t even attend his school. </p>
