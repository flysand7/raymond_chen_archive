<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Those blue boxes all over the place, I always wondered what they were for</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was at the post office waiting my turn at the <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/blog/self-service-mail-technologies">kiosk</a>. The group in front of me consisted of three teenage girls. After purchasing their postage and affixing it to their letter, they looked around, confused. </p>
<p>“What’s the problem?” I asked. </p>
<p>“What do I do now?” ask the girl holding the letter. </p>
<p>“Um, you put it in a post box,” I answered. </p>
<p>The girls looked around. </p>
<p>“Where’s a post box?” </p>
<p>You might recall that we are standing <i>in the post office</i>. </p>
<p>I point out a few. </p>
<p>“Oh, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USPS_mailboxes.jpg">the blue things</a>,” she said, as if she had seen those blue things all over the place but had not until now realized what they were for. </p>
<p>I’m old. </p>
<p>The world’s first adhesive postage stamp was issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Black">on this date in 1840</a>. </p>
