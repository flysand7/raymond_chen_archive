<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It's like the Swedes don't want you to learn their language</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>(It’s a holiday in the States today and tomorrow, so I’m not going to talk about geek stuff.  That’ll resume on Monday.)
 If you pay a visit to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/">Deutsche Welle</a>, the German international broadcasting service, you will find a wide array of online German learning materials, such as <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/german/0,3367,2146,00.html"> the daily news in slowly- and clearly-enunciated German</a> (including transcripts) and <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/german/0,3367,2203-0-0-S,00.html"> dozens of half-hour mini-documentaries designed for students of German</a> (including transcripts and exercise worksheets). These are great for improving my woefully deficient listening comprehension skills.
 On the other hand, all I could find for students of Swedish is <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/spelare/spelare.asp?typ=fil&amp;namn=/p4/klartext/sounds/klartext.ram"> the weekly news in simple Swedish</a>. No transcripts, no lessons. Sure, I can listen to all of the Swedish national radio stations anytime I want, but they sort of assume you’re fluent in Swedish.</p>
<p> And if you go to google and search for “Swedish movies”, trust me, the top hits are definitely <strong>not</strong> the works of Ingmar Bergman. (Yes, I know about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list">IMDB PowerSearch</a>. Now.) </p>
