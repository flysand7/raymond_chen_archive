<p> (In the continuing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/03/567321.aspx"> sporadic series on the wisdom of seventh grade students</a>.) </p>
<p> My friend the seventh grade teacher once had to deal with a class that had gotten out of hand by assigning the students a short essay in which they had to address three questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>How am I contributing to class? </li>
<li>How am I detracting from class? </li>
<li>How can I contribute more while detracting less? </li>
</ul>
<p> One of the more disruptive students answered the questions thus: </p>
<ul>
<li>How am I contributing to class?<br/>     “I tell jokes.” </li>
<li>How am I detracting from class?<br/>     “Sometimes I talk out of turn.” </li>
<li>How can I contribute more while detracting less?<br/>     “Tell better jokes.” </li>
</ul>
