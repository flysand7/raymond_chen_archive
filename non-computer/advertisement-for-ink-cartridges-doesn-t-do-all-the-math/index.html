<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Advertisement for ink cartridges doesn’t do all the math</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I saw an advertisement for manufacturer-authorized ink cartridges. It said, approximately, “Our ink cartridges print up to 2× longer than third-party refills.” </p>
<p>“For only 4× the price” the advertisement somehow forgot to mention. </p>
