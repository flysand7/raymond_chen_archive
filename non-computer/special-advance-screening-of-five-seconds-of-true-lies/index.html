<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Special advance screening of five seconds of True Lies</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In response to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/19/2182810.aspx"> <i>Perhaps the movies made too literal a translation</i></a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ssinofsky/default.mspx"> Steve Sinofsky</a> reminded me that everybody at Microsoft got a special advance screening of the movie <i>True Lies</i>, or at least five seconds’ worth.
 The computer that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character infiltrates runs the Arabic version of Windows 3.1, and the Arabic version of Word 6 appeared on screen as well. Steve was in charge of the Office division at the time and managed to get permission to show a clip from a rough cut of the movie at the 1994 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/21/764634.aspx"> company meeting</a>. He explains, “I had to run to the airport and pick up a beta tape, show it at the meeting, and then return it via air-courier.”
 It was like some sort of spy movie.</p>
<p> Oh, wait. </p>
