<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Merry Christmas to me: Zune headphones</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> My article some time back about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/13/9906360.aspx"> accidentally destroying my beloved Zune headphones</a> resulted in a number of people sending me their unwanted Zune headphones via inter-office mail. This was not my intention when I posted the article—if that were my goal, I would have posted the article immediately instead of waiting a year and a half!—but it was nevertheless a pleasant surprise. Every so often <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/17/8080157.aspx"> strangers come through</a>. </p>
<p> Thanks, everybody. </p>
