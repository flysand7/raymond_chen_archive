<p>Commenter Boris mentions that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/24/9927970.aspx#9928599"> he uses NJ Transit to get rid of his excess pennies</a>. But what do you do if your area isn’t served by NJ Transit?
 I use the self-checkout line at the grocery store. The machine has a slot for accepting coins, and you can drop pennies in there until your arm falls off. I don’t do this when the grocery store is crowded, since this holds up the line.</p>
<p> (Yes, banks also have change-counting machines, but using the machine is overkill when you have only thirty pennies to get rid of.) </p>
