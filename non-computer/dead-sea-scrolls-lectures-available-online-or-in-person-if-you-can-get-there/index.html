<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dead Sea Scrolls lectures available online (or in person if you can get there)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/12/16/504660.aspx"> As I noted last year</a>, <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/dss/"> the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Seattle</a>, and in conjunction with the exhibition is <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/dss/lectures.html"> a series of eleven lectures at Town Hall</a>. Tonight’s lecture is <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/articles/ddss_lecture_101206.html"> <i>The Dead Sea Scrolls, Jesus &amp; The Da Vinci Code</i></a>. These lectures are rebroadcast on <a href="http://www.seattlechannel.org/"> <i>The Seattle Channel</i></a>, and it appears that the city also <a href="http://www.seattlechannel.org/videos/watchVideos.asp?program=townHall"> makes the video available via streaming media</a>. It takes a few weeks for them to make it to the archive page, though. The first lecture in the series, <a href="http://www.seattlechannel.org/videos/video.asp?ID=5070634"> <i>Dead Sea Scrolls: Early Judaism and the Births of Christianity</i></a> just went up. Fascinating stuff.</p>
