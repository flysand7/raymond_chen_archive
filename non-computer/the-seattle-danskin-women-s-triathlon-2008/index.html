<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Seattle Danskin Women’s Triathlon 2008</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This Sunday will be the Nth annual Seattle <a href="http://www.danskin.com/triathlon.html"> Danskin Women’s Triathlon</a> (for some value of N greater than 1), the largest women-only triathlon. I learned about this event last year when I saw that the express lanes on the I-90 bridge were crowded with bicyclists, and I went online to try to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p> As I clicked around, I found the <a href="http://www.seattledanskintri.info/"> Volunteer Site</a> and was particularly impressed with the <a href="http://www.seattledanskintri.info/Volunteer/Positions.asp#Swim%20Angel"> Swim Angels</a>. (<a href="http://www.danskin.com/angels.html">More details</a>.) These are strong women swimmers whose job it is to accompany the weaker swimmers and provide moral support. </p>
<p> I was chatting with a friend of mine, who noted that one of the first volunteer positions to fill is the “Help the women change out of their wetsuits in the transition area.” Go figure. </p>
<p> Best wishes to all of this weekend’s participants! </p>
