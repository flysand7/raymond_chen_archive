<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Welcome to the 2008 holiday shopping season</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Yes, maybe you’re one of those crazy people who camps out in front of a store so you can be the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/293681_shopping25.html"> first person in line</a> to get this year’s hot toy, or so you can snag one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorbuster"> doorbuster</a> deals. But be judicious in your rush, because <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004031186_webtroopers23m.html"> the police are out there too, and they’re shopping for something else</a>.</p>
