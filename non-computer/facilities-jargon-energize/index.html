<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Facilities jargon: Energize</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Over in the product engineering groups, we aren’t often exposed to the jargon employed by our Facilities group. But once in a while, it leaks through and then we get to puzzle it out.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Emergency Electrical Outage and Restoral</b> </p>
<p> Due to a transformer failure, power to building <span style="background-color: black">NNN</span> was shut down from 6:00am to 6:30am on <span style="background-color: black">MMMM-DD</span>. </p>
<p> Occupants may need to re-energize their office equipment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> From what we can gather, <i>re-energize</i> is just a fancy way of saying <i>turn on</i>.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus jargon</b>: Restoral. </p>
