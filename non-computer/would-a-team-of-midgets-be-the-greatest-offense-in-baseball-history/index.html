<p><a href="http://todd33.com/"> Todd Gallagher</a> answers <a href="http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0717/2007017845.html"> the weird sports questions you always wondered but knew were too stupid even to ask</a>. Think of it as the sports version of <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html"> <i>Mythbusters</i></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would a team of midgets be the greatest offense in baseball history,     because they would draw walk after walk after walk? </li>
<li><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119143109983647814.html">Could a morbidly obese goalie shut out an NHL team</a>? </li>
<li>Could an average person beat a professional tennis player if the     pro had to use a frying pan instead of a racquet? </li>
</ul>
<p> Well, he sort of gives away the answer to the last question in the title of his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307352803?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307352803"> <i>Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan</i></a>. The stories behind how he set about finding the answers to these absurd questions are even more entertaining than the answers themselves! Here’s <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/shows/2007/11/20071117.asp"> an interview with <i>Only a Game</i>‘s Bill Littlefield</a>.

<p> On a somewhat concidental note, tonight I’m going to watch the <a href="http://www.seattlethunderbirds.com/"> Seattle Thunderbirds</a> take on the <a href="http://www.amshockey.com/"> Tri-City Americans</a>, making good on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/02/82721.aspx"> my earlier admission of the possibility of seeing another hockey game</a>. Hopefully with normal-sized goalies. </p>
