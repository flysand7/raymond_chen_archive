<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The guerilla wedding</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> When two of my friends were getting married (to each other), there was of course a lot of effort spent on finding the right wedding location. To relieve the tension, when we got together, we would amuse ourselves by coming up with <i>guerilla wedding locations</i>, which was our term for surreptitiously holding a wedding ceremony at a location without the site owner’s knowledge. Everybody would converge on the designated location, wait for the secret signal, and then spontaneously assemble for a wedding ceremony, wrapping it all up before anybody else knew what happened. Here are some ideas in the Seattle area we came up with: </p>
<ul>
<li>     A Seattle ferry.     (Oops,     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/outdoors/2008883097_nwwferries19.html">     turns out this is normal</a>!) </li>
<li>A Metro express bus. </li>
<li>The     <a href="http://buckleyplanet.typepad.com/cafetour/2008/02/a-room-with-a-v.html">     top floor</a>     of     <a href="http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/Microsoft-Facility-Sneak-Peak-Lincoln-Square/">     Lincoln Square</a>.     (Reception to be held on floor 27.)     Though apparently     <a href="http://seattlescondo.com/?p=15">     the Bravern cafeterias are even more amazing</a>. </li>
<li>The     <a href="http://www.bellevuebotanical.org/gallery/groundcover/fmgroundcover.htm">     viewing pavilion of the Groundcover Garden</a>     at     <a href="http://www.bellevuebotanical.org/">     Bellevue Botanical Garden</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Even now, with the wedding planning a dim memory, when we find a particularly nice location, we still find ourselves turning to each other and saying, “guerilla wedding.” </p>
