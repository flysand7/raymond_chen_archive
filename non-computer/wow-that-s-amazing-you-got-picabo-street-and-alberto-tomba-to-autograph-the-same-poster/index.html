<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Wow, that’s amazing. You got Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba to autograph the same poster!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’ve written about my colleague Danny <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050926-15/?p=34043">some time ago</a>. Danny is an accomplished skier, and for a time, he had a poster in his office that was a split-screen of Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba, and autographed by both skiers. </p>
<p>I remarked, “Wow, that’s amazing. You got Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba to autograph the same poster!” </p>
<p>Danny copped to the truth. </p>
<p>“Well, sort of. That autograph of Picabo Street is authentic. After she signed her name on her half of the poster, I asked her to forge Alberto Tomba’s signature on the other half.” </p>
