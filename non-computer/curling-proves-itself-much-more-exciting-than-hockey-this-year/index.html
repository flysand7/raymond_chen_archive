<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Curling proves itself much more exciting than hockey this year</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> reports on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4518397"> an amazing last-rock shot</a> at the Canadian women’s curling championship (includes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/MRL/clips/rm-lo/hearts_winningshot050227.rm"> link to CBC video</a>). It’s odd hearing Melissa Block discussing curling in decidedly non-curling terms (for the benefit of the decidedly non-curling US listenership). One of the advantages of living in the Seattle area is that you can get all the curling coverage you want from the CBC just over the border. </p>
<p> The National Post has a report <a href="http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/news/sports/story.html?id=e7fc357c-8d70-4989-a524-9b211e1f3f63"> loaded with curling jargon</a>, for those who prefer their curling coverage filled with discussion of draw weight, stolen deuces, and in-turns. </p>
