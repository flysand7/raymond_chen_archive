<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An unexpected application of the First Law of Thermodynamics</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This past winter, my furnace failed catastrophically. (The furnace repair person told me that when furnaces fail, it tends to be catastrophic failure.) It was a few days before everything was back in order, and the very day everything was working again, the furnace belonging to one of my relatives stopped working.</p>
<p> This was an application of the First Law of Thermodynamics with which I had previously been unfamiliar. </p>
<p> Fortunately, the repair on the second furnace was very simple and was done in just a few hours. </p>
<p> After I informed my friends of my discovery of this law of the universe, one of them wrote, “Our furnace broke on Sunday. I can’t help but feel like you’re kind of responsible.” </p>
