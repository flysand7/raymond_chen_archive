<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">There’s no law that says two people can’t have the same thing to eat</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, my group went out for a team lunch. It was to a restaurant we were not familiar with, so there was quite a bit of time studying the menu. As everybody looked over the menu, discussion naturally turned to “So what are you going to have?”</p>
<p> “I think I’ll have the salmon sandwich.” </p>
<p> One of my colleagues replied, “Oh, rats. I was thinking of having that.” </p>
<p> I remarked, “There’s no law that says <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/05/10391042.aspx"> two people can’t order the same thing</a>.” </p>
<p> My colleague disagreed. </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> Not if you ask my wife. Whenever we go out to eat, she’ll ask me what I’m having, and then she’ll say “Oh, rats. I was thinking of having that. Now I’ll have to order something else.” </p>
<p> I’ll say, “You can order it too, that’s okay. Or I’ll change my order, no big deal.” </p>
<p> But she’ll say, “No, that’s okay. I’ll just find something else.” </p>
<p> I’ve tried many times without success to convince her that it’s okay for two people to have the same thing to eat. Now I just accept it. </p>

<p> <b>Update</b>: A few months later, I received an update from my colleague. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The other night, my wife and I went out to dinner, and my wife <i>really wanted</i> the same that I had already said that I was going to order. But instead of switching to something else, <i>she ordered it anyway</i>. I think this is the first time this has ever happened. And you know what? The world did not end. </p></blockquote>
