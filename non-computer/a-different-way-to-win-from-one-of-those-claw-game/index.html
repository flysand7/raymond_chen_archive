<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A different way to win from one of those claw game</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I know two people (siblings) who are experts at those claw games. They can look at a claw game, assess the situation, decide whether there is a winnable toy, and if so, drop in their quarter and grab it. I asked the elder sibling how they arrived at this amazing skill.
 “As a teenager, I spent something like $20 pumping quarters into one of these machines, and I eventually figured it out.”</p>
<p> Or there is the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/07/video-of-kid-climbin.html"> direct approach</a>. </p>
