<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>An informal tradition in a former group was that whenever somebody bought a new car, we all went out to lunch to celebrate, but the person with the new car had to be one of the drivers.
 During one of our new-car trips, the proud owner of the new car showed off its fancy features. “Check this out, this car has a voice-controlled radio: Radio, On.”
 The car radio turned on.
 “Radio, Select KUOW.”
 The radio changed its station.
 “Radio, louder.”
 The volume went up.
 But this wasn’t a demonstration of voice-recognition technology. It was a magic trick.
 You see, the car has radio controls built into the back of the steering wheel.</p>
