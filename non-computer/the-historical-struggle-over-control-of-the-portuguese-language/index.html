<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The historical struggle over control of the Portuguese language</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Portugal has been going through a rough patch. Its international stature has diminished over the years, its economy has always struggled to remain competitive, the government had to accept a bailout to avoid defaulting on its debt, and on top of it all, it is losing control of its own language.
 In Portugal, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Language_Orthographic_Agreement_of_1990"> latest round of Portuguese spelling reform</a> takes effect over a six-year transition period, leaving the Portuguese dismayed that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004376336_portugese27.html"> the spelling of their language is being driven by Brazil, a former colony</a>. I sympathize with the plight of the Portuguese, although I also understand the value of consistent spelling. (The rules for the English language are established <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Language_regulators"> not by any central authority</a> but rather are determined by convention.)
 I wonder if the U.K. feels the same way about its former colony.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: The <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/terminology/"> Microsoft Language Portal Blog</a> reports that <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/terminology/archive/2009/01/21/portuguese-spelling-reform-in-brazil.aspx"> Microsoft intends to phase in the spelling reform over a four-year period for Brazil-localized products</a>. A quick glance at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/StyleGuides.aspx"> Microsoft style guide for Portuguese (Portugal)</a> says that the spelling reform has yet to take effect among the Portugal-localized version of Microsoft products. </p>
