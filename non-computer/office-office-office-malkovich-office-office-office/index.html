<p> Some years ago, a colleague of mine received a message from our IT department. It began like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> You are receiving this notification because our records show that the machines below are still running a pre-release version of Office 2010. All pre-release versions of Office 2010 will expire on Office 31, 2010. </p></blockquote>
<p> Either the Office team managed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaming_of_Turkmen_months_and_days_of_week,_2002"> name a month after themselves</a>, or the IT department had a bit too much Office on their mind. </p>
