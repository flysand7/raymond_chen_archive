<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Ten-year-old + Microsoft Flight Simulator = terrorist</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Apparently a ten-year-old who put <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/fsim/"> Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> on his Christmas wish-list <a href="http://www.recorder.com/Headlines/tuesday_basic.htm"> became the subject of a terrorism investigation</a>. (Warning: I suspect that link will go stale in a week, so read it while you still can.) As always, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/34776.html"> The Register puts a snarky spin on the story</a>.</p>
