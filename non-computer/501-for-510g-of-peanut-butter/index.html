<p>You can buy  <a href="http://ois.nist.gov/srmcatalog/common/view_detail.cfm?srm=2387">  510 grams of peanut butter for only $501</a>.
  Of course, this is special peanut butter.  It must be kept at -20°C.  And it is not intended for human consumption.
  This is peanut butter from the  <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards  and Technology</a>  intended for use by food analysis laboratories to  calibrate their equipment.  For example, standard peanut butter consists of  10.4% ± 0.2% saturated fat.</p>
