<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">[6] days since last monorail breakdown</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> It’s soon going to come to the point where this is no longer news. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003211932_monorail20m.html"> The Seattle monorail broke down again</a>, just six days since <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/9674845/detail.html"> the previous breakdown</a>, which was in turn just two days after <a href="http://www.komotv.com/stories/44878.htm"> operations resumed</a>. </p>
<p> I think they need to put up a big sign at the Monorail station at Seattle Center that reads </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p style="padding: 1ex"> <font size="+1"> <span style="border: solid .75pt black;padding: .5ex">6</span> days since last breakdown. </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Well, except that today it would read “2”. </p>
