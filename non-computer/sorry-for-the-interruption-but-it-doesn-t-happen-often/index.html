<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Sorry for the interruption, but it doesn’t happen often</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, my feature manager and I were called into the project leader’s office for some reason or other, I forget exactly what. </p>
<p>We were about five minutes into the meeting when the project leader’s mobile phone rang. This was back in the days when mobile phones were not commonplace, and having one was a way of showing off your status. </p>
<p>The project leader answered the call, but instead of saying, “I’m in a meeting, can I call you back?” he proceeded to carry on a conversation with the caller as if we weren’t there, while we sat there and waited. </p>
<p>I got up and left his office. </p>
<p>I went downstairs to the lobby and read whatever newspaper happened to be sitting there for visitors to read while they waited. I think it was <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, but it could have been <i>The New York Times</i>. </p>
<p>After finishing a section of the paper, I came back upstairs to the project leader’s office. By that time, the project leader had finished his call, whatever it was. </p>
<p>As I sat down, the project leader said, “Sorry, I don’t get calls on this phone often.” </p>
<p>I immediately replied, “That’s okay, I don’t read <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> often either.” </p>
