<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to act like you know Chinese even though you don’t, episode 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My brother-in-law told me that in college he was hanging out with his friends, one of whom was Korean. The Korean friend said, “Hey, y’know, I actually speak some Chinese.”</p>
<p>His friend demonstrated by raising his arm and pointing vaguely forward, shaking his hand slightly, and saying “Nugga nugga nugga nugga nugga…”</p>
<p>This is hilarious if you speak Mandarin, because what he’s saying is “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%82%A3%E5%80%8B">那個</a>那個那個那個那個…”</p>
<p>The word “那個” literally means “that” in the sense of “that object over there.” But in Mandarin Chinese, it is a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(linguistics)"> filler word</a>, used to stall for time while you hunt for the correct word. As with many other languages, a hand gesture often accompanies the use of the filler word.</p>
