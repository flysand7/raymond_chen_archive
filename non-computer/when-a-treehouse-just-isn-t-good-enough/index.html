<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When a treehouse just isn't good enough</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Not satisfied with a patio or treehouse, some people have built <a href="http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/NMT01.html"> a monorail</a> or a <a href="http://www.negative-g.com/BlueFlash/February2002/Blue-Flash-2002-2-1.html"> roller coaster</a> in their backyard. And then there’s this one guy <a href="http://www.waynesthisandthat.com/projects.htm"> who apparently has not yet run out of strange things to build in his backyard</a>. Former projects include include a domed swimming pool, a garden accessible only from above, a carousel, and a forty-four foot kite.</p>
