<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The military marriage of convenience</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099699/"> marriage of convenience</a> is alive and well, not that is really a surprise to anybody. I found interesting this story on how <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/01/24/PM200601247.html"> some young members of the US military are getting married for purely economic reasons</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> By getting married, he would get a housing stipend and permission to move off-base. And as his legal wife, she would get health coverage and a cut of his extra money. </p></blockquote>
