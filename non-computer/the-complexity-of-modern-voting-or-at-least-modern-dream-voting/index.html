<p> I dreamed that I arrived at my polling station just before it closed, but the ballot was not what I expected. Instead of voting on political candidates or referenda, I was voting on music from the 1980’s. I ended up voting for an Anne Murray song because it was the only one I recognized, and it wasn’t a bad song.</p>
