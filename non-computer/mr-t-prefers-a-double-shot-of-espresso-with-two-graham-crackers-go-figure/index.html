<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Mr. T prefers a double-shot of espresso with two graham crackers, go figure</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in November, <a href="http://www.pauldavidson.net/"> Paul Davidson</a> popped into his local Starbucks coffee shop and ended up <a href="http://www.pauldavidson.net/2005/11/02/mr-t-likes-the-double-shot-espresso/"> in line right behind Mr. T</a>. Unlike me, Mr. Davidson actually knew ahead of time what he was going to ask the former A-Team heavy. And the answer was worth waiting for.
 (Via <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/"> TV Squad</a>: <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/11/02/mr-t-likes-espresso-fool/"> Mr. T likes espresso, fool</a>!)</p>
<p> Mr. T has not disappeared from the scene entirely, however. <a href="http://www.tvland.com/">TV Land</a> announced [<a href="http://www.tvland.com/press/pdf/091205PitytheFool.pdf">pdf</a>] last September a new reality show starring the former A-Team heavy tentatively titled <i>I Pity The Fool</i> (capital “The” for some reason). <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/cgi/pr.cgi?id=20060502tvland01"> More recent coverage</a>. </p>
