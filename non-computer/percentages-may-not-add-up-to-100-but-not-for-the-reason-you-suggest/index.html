<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Percentages may not add up to 100%, but not for the reason you suggest</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I saw a chart which had the disclaimer, “Percentages may not add up to 100%, as they are rounded to the nearest percent.”
 The values in the table were 10.4%, 4.0%, 9.4%, 9.3%, 9.2%, 21.2%, 20.0%, and 15.8%.</p>
<p> This is a use of the phrase “nearest percent” I was previously unfamiliar with. </p>
