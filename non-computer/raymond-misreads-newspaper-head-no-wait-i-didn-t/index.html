<p>I have a habit of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/02/8568489.aspx"> misreading newspaper headlines</a>, so I simply assumed that this was just another one: <i> <a href="http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jun/29/phelps-sets-word-record-400-im/"> Phelps sets word record in 400 IM</a></i>. (And no, I don’t normally read the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>. The actual headline was printed across the top of the June 30 <i>Seattle Times</i> Sports section, but I couldn’t find the headline in the online archives, so I found another newspaper with the same headline.)</p>
<p> Wow, how fast did he IM 400 words? </p>
<p> Duh, I must’ve misread it. Obviously the headline said <i>world</i> record. </p>
<p> No wait, it really was <i>word record</i>! </p>
