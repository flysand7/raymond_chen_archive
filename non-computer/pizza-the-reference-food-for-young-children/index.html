<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Pizza: The reference food for young children</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One way to convince a child to try out an unfamiliar food is to say that it’s an alternate form of pizza. Here are some examples. Feel free to add more in the comments. </p>
<ul>
<li>Quesadilla: Mexican pizza </li>
<li>Dosa: Indian pizza </li>
<li>Quiche: French deep-dish pizza </li>
</ul>
<p> I had originally listed crêpe as French pizza, then realized it’s more like a French pancake. (I wonder <a href="http://notalwaysright.com/ordering-pizza-talking-baloney/6793"> what the Italian version of pizza would be</a>…) </p>
