<p> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5498454"> Wendy’s is getting rid of “Biggie” and “Great Biggie” size drinks and fries</a> from their menu. Oh, they’re still offering them, just with a different name. What used to be “Biggie” is now “medium” and what used to be “Great Biggie” is now “large”. Even the “small” drink is a massive 20 ounces, or two and a half FDA servings.</p>
