<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Steamy coffee leaves grounds for concern</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m embarrassed for the bad pun,¹ but the subject is serious. Two stories appeared in the two major local newspapers on the same day.</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003535398_coffeegirls22e.html">     Coffee stands experiment with “sexpresso”</a>,     using scantily-glad baristas to lure customers.     (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betel_nut_beauty">Taiwan has been doing this for ages</a>,     not without controversy.) </li>
<li> <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/300667_stalker22ww.html">     Man charged for stalking, threatening barista</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Sure, it may have been a coincidence, but I considered it a cautionary tale. </p>
<p> <b>Follow-ups</b> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_082307WAB_monroe_latte_dress_TP.63094d58.html"> Baristas resign en masse</a></p>
<p> when the coffee stand owner decides to adopt a provocative dress code. </p>
<p> Over a year later, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94715155"> NPR picks up the story</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b> </p>
<p> ¹I’m not embarrassed for making a pun, just that it’s a bad pun. (Some people would argue that there’s no such thing as a good pun.) </p>
