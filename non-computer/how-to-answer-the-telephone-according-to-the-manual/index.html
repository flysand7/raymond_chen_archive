<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to answer the telephone, according to the manual</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I have a fancy new office telephone with a bajillion features (most of which I will never even find, much less use). The telephone comes with a helpful manual, explaining how to carry out various tasks. For example: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> <b style="font-size: larger">Answering a Call</b> </p>
<p> <b>Using the Handset:</b><br/> Pick up the handset. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Cool, I was wondering about that. </p>
