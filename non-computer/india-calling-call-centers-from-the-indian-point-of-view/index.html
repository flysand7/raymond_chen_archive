<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">India Calling: Call centers from the Indian point of view</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In the United States, the growing relocation of call centers to India has been the source of much hand-wringing, but for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction: What effect is this having on India? </p>
<p> The primetime soap opera <a href="http://starone.indya.com/serials/indiacalling/show.html"> <i>India Calling</i></a> looks at the effect of a 600,000-person industry, the eyebrows raised when neighbors see a young single woman heading to work at night and returning in the morning, the social change this new affluence brings, and the stress of a job that consists in large part of talking to rude, angry Americans. <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2007/04/13/PM200704136.html"> Welcome to Bollywood</a>. </p>
