<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Raymond misreads newspaper headlines, episode 3</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The headline: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004446322_apalabamatornadograduation.html"> <i>First lady to speak at Ala. school hit by tornado</i></a>.
 My interpretation: There’s a woman who was the first woman to speak at an Alabama school. This is notable presumably because she had to break some historical gender barrier in order to be invited to give an address there. That woman was hit by a tornado.
 My reaction: Man, what horrible luck, for a person to be hit by a tornado. I hope she’s okay.</p>
<p> What the headline actually meant: A school in Alabama was hit by a tornado. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/firstlady/flbio.html"> First Lady</a> will visit that school. </p>
