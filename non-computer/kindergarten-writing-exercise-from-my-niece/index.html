<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Kindergarten writing exercise from my niece</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When my niece was in kindergarten, a regular classroom assignment was for students to write a few sentences about something happening in their lives. For one of the assignments, my niece wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> My auntie has a baby in her tumy. If it is a boy I will call him Kevin. If it is a grl I will call her Alula. </p></blockquote>
<p> We have no idea where the name “Alula” came from.
 The baby turned out to be a girl, but her aunt chose a different name.
 My niece did not hold up her end of the bargain and call her new cousin “Alula”.</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Upon further reflection, I think the proposed boy’s name was “Derik”, not Kevin. Not important to the story, but included for completeness. </p>
