<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Eventually you reach a critical mass of LEGO pieces where you can build most things from what you already have</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My kids are fascinated by camper vans and recreational vehicles. (They keep asking to go camping, but not for the purpose of experiencing nature. It’s because they want to travel in a camper.) They wanted a camper van LEGO set, but instead of buying one, we went online and <a href="http://lego.brickinstructions.com/en/lego_instructions/set/60117/rb">found the instructions for an existing camper van set</a> and built it from the pieces we already have. </p>
<p>And then, of course, the kids modified the result to suit their needs. The resulting camper van looks like a lot of fun, but driving it around may be a bit difficult seeing as it has a height clearance of 30 feet. </p>
<p>Useful sites: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://brickinstructions.com/">BrickInstructions.com</a>     has instructions for LEGO sets, in case you lost yours,     or you want to see instructions for other sets. </li>
<li> <a href="http://rebrickable.com/">Rebrickable</a>     contains user-contributed instructions.     You can tell it what LEGO sets you own,     and it will tell you what you can build from them. </li>
<li> <a href="http://brickset.com/">BrickSet</a>     has among other things a     <a href="http://brickset.com/parts/">part finder</a>.     One thing I use it for is recovering the name of the set     by searching for pieces that appear to be unique to that set. </li>
</ul>
