<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Shocked (shocked!) that patronage exists in Chicago politics</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> reported on a startling discovery in Chicago: That government jobs go not to those best qualified to perform them, but rather to those with the best connections. Who’d-a thunk it? </p>
<p> Shocked by this discovery, the Daley administration vowed to end it. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The City of Chicago’s top lawyer Mara Georges told incredulous City Hall reporters yesterday that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4665091"> the hiring system will now be completely fair, objective, and free of political influence</a>. “City hiring will be on the square, yes.” </p></blockquote>
<p> The Associated Press notes that “<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-chicago-clout,1,4668487,print.story">City officials have long denied that political favoritism or patronage had anything to do with who got jobs</a>.” <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/"> The Chicago Sun-Times</a> captures the sentiment quite succinctly: <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/brown/cst-nws-brown04.html"> <i>Who knew politics as usual in Chicago is against the law?</i></a> </p>
