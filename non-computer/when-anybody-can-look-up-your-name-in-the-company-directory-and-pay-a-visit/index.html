<p>In late 2004, I was working in my office, minding my own business. I normally keep my door open, as do most other people.</p>
<p> «Knock-knock» </p>
<p> I turn around. There’s somebody at the door. </p>
<p> “Oh, nothing,” the person said. “I just wanted to look at you.” </p>
<p> I closed the door and drew my blinds. </p>
<p> What would you have done? </p>
<p> (In retrospect, I obviously should have installed a webcam and charged a membership fee.) </p>
