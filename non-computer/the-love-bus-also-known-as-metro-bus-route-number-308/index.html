<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The love bus, also known as Metro Bus Route number 308</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Four years ago, Troy Kleweno spotted Christine Hsieh on <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/cftemplates/show_map.cfm?BUS_ROUTE=308&amp;DAY_NAV=W"> the 308 bus</a>. He saw her twice a day, once in the morning on the way to work, and again in the evening on the way home. His co-workers teased him about the “bus girl” he pined after for six months before he finally <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004353134_webbusproposal16m.html"> said hello</a>. That led to a date, and soon they were a couple.</p>
<p> It’s only fitting then that when Troy decided that  it was time to propose marriage, that he do it <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/kcdot/news/2008/nr080416_lovebus.htm"> on the 308 bus</a>. <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/kcdot/news/videos/2008/041608_308proposal.htm"> Watch it here</a>. </p>
<p> Happy Valentine’s Day, everybody. </p>
