<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The tradition of giving cute names to unborn babies</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many of my friends gave names to their unborn babies. Most of them were based on various objects that were the size of the adorable little parasite¹ at the time they discovered that they were pregnant:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Peanut </li>
<li>Gumdrop </li>
<li>Jellybean </li>
<li>Blueberry </li>
<li>Mr. Bean </li>
</ul>
<p> There were a few outliers, though.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory">Tadpole</a> </li>
<li>Aubergine </li>
</ul>
<p> That last one takes a bit of explaining. Having grown tired of people asking her what she was planning on naming the baby, my friend made up an absurd name and used it with a straight face. “We’re think of naming her Aubergine, if it’s a girl.” People would respond with a polite but confused “Oh, that’s an interesting name.”
 Then, still deadpan, she would add, “If it’s a boy, then we’re leaning toward Mad-Dog.”
 That usually tipped people off that she was just messing with them.</p>

<p> ¹ A peek behind the curtain: I couldn’t decide whether to write fetus or embryo, and I knew that if I picked one, then people would say that I should’ve picked the other, so I decided to avoid the issue entirely by writing “adorable little parasite”. This is what nitpickers have turned me into. </p>
