<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I sort of knew that I’m a bad flute player, but I guess this proves it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In college, a friend of mine gave me his old flute to entice me into taking up the instrument. He noted, “The low notes are kind of bad on this one.”</p>
<p>And he was right. I indeed had difficulty playing the low notes with that flute. I blamed the flute.</p>
<p>Fast-forward five years. I visited a relative who played the flute. I tried out her flute. I still couldn’t hit the low notes reliably.</p>
<p>So all those years, it wasn’t the flute. It was me.</p>
<p>I sort of knew that, but that destroyed the last shred of hope that it was just the flute.</p>
