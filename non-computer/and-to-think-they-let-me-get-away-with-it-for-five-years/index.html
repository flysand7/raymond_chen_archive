<p>According to <a href="http://www.njstatelib.org/Research_Guides/Historical_Documents/nj/NJCON02.html"> the Constitution of the State of New Jersey, Article II</a>, paragraph 6:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> No idiot or insane person shall enjoy the right of suffrage. </p></blockquote>
<p> Why are constitutional articles labelled with Roman numerals? Makes it sound like the <a href="http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/super-bowl1.htm"> Super Bowl</a> or something. </p>
<p> The state appellate court did rule a few years ago that <a href="http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/Governance/NewJersey.htm"> being hospitalized for psychiatric treatment does not constitute being insane</a> for the purpose of determining voter eligibility. </p>
<p> Today is Election Day in the United States. Don’t forget to vote! (Void where prohibited.) </p>
