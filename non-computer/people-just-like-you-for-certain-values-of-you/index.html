<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">People just like you, for certain values of you</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I received a brochure in the mail for a local church which says that it’s “full of people just like you.”
 Everybody in the brochure is white.
 “You’ll fit right in!” it concludes.</p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: My friends guessed that perhaps the church members are all computer programmers who work at Microsoft and speak Swedish badly. </p>
