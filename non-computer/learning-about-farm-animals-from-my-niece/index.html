<p>I was playing with my niece (three years old at the time of this story), and she taught me a lot about farm animals. </p>
<ul>
<li>You get eggs from cows and pigs. 
<li>Cow eggs are black and taste like bananas. 
<li>Pig eggs are blue and pink and taste like ice cream. 
<li>Blue pig eggs taste like vanilla. 
<li>Pink pig eggs taste like strawberry. </li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.internationalegg.com/">International Egg Commission</a>, today is <a href="http://thinkegg.com/index.php/world-egg-day/">World Egg Day</a>. </p>
