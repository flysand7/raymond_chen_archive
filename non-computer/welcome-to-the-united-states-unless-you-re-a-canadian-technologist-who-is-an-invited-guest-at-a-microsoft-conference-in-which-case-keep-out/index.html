<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Welcome to the United States, unless you're a Canadian technologist who is an invited guest at a Microsoft conference, in which case, keep out</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Vancouver technologist <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com"> Darren Barefoot</a> was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msnsearch/archive/2005/11/29/498054.aspx"> invited to Redmond by the MSN Search team</a> but was <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2006/01/im-an-alien-an-illegal-alien.html"> stopped by Immigration and denied entry</a>.</p>

<p> Sorry, Darren. We miss you already. We even <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002745278_webrainrecord17.html"> asked the rain to take a few days off</a> and invited the sun out to play just for you. </p>
