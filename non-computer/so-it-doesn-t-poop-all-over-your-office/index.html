<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">… so it doesn't poop all over your office</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The other day I caught a fragment of a conversation, namely somebody concluding a sentence with the clause “… so it doesn’t poop all over your office”.
 I don’t know what they were talking about and I’m not sure I want to find out.</p>
<p> (<a href="http://blog.ryjones.org/">Ry Jones</a> thinks I was the victim a game of <a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001827.php#c109100"> tomato funeral</a>. I’m not convinced; it was a conversation that I had been drifting in and out of at the lunch table. I just picked a bad time to drift back in.) </p>
