<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Anybody remember Blade Squad or MV24?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  It’s often fun to go back and see  <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~aaron2/fox/fox-news.html#develop97">  the kooky ideas for television shows that floated around years ago</a>.  Here are some from 1997:  </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Blade Squad</i> –  An action series set in the year 2001  about a cop who gets around on jet-powered roller skates.   </li>
<li><i>My Beautiful World</i> –  A comedy whose characters include a Marilyn Monroe impersonator  and a child with the body of a 10-month-old baby  and the head of a Queens cab driver.   </li>
<li><i>The Notorious</i> –  A drama about seven crime families,  each representing one of the seven deadly sins.   </li>
<li><i>MV24</i> –  A sitcom about a music video channel, starring Peter Scolari.   </li>
</ul>
<p>  Plenty more on the linked web site.  What’s really scary is that a lot of these kooky ideas  turned into actual television programs!  </p>
