<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/9/20857136/sony-playstation-x-button-apparently-actually-called-cross-button-circle-controller"> PlayStation UK created a horrific uproar</a> when they proclaimed that <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/1169651442027827200?s=20"> the 🞩 button on the PlayStation controller is called “cross”, and not “X”</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, but I’m still going to call it “X”.</p>
<p>In the United States, the term “cross” is used to refer almost exclusively to the religious symbol 🕇 or shapes similar to it, with the same vertical orientation. It certainly is not commonly used to refer to the rotated symbol 🞩.¹ The name of the rotated symbol is almost uniformly “X”.</p>
<p>The game of Noughts and Crosses is called Tic-Tac-Toe in the States.</p>
<p>¹ We also do not use the word “cross” to mean “angry”. A sentence like “She was cross about the delay” is distinctly British English.</p>
