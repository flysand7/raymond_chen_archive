<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Apparently they know more information about me than me, but dare I ask?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There’s this software services company that retweets content from various technology sites, and they end every one with “Want to learn more? Call us at…”.

<p>Note that a casual glance at the format of the given phone number may make you think it’s a United States/Canadian number, but it’s not, so readers in the United States should be careful: It likely won’t be covered by your “free national long distance” plan. </p>
<p>Maybe I should record a One Dev Minute video about a problem that stumped me, and then I can send them an email and ask for the solution! </p>
