<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the crash</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In February 2007, a serious automobile accident took place in southwest Washington. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003591391_webboydriver27m.html"> A twelve-year-old boy was at the wheel of an SUV</a> when he lost control and struck another vehicle. According to the sheriff’s office, “Excessive speed appeared to be a factor in the crash.” I dunno, I think a major factor is that <i>a twelve-year-old was behind the wheel</i>.</p>
<p> Tragically, the boy sustained critical injuries and died the following day. There was an adult in the car who conveniently <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003609813_webboydriver09m.html"> doesn’t remember what happened</a>, although there are rumors that <a href="http://www.tdn.com/articles/2007/03/01/top_story/news01.txt"> this wasn’t the first time that adult let the boy drive</a>, and that the boy had remarked to a friend that “<a href="http://www.katu.com/news/6344602.html">he always drove to school</a>.” Okay, what adult lets a twelve year old boy drive a car? Apparently, he was permitted to drive because he asked to. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/News+flash/default.aspx"> News flash</a>: There are times when the correct answer is “No”. </p>
<p> Follow-up: Court documents cite witnesses who claim “<a href="http://www.kgw.com/neighborhood/vancouver/stories/kgw_030907_news_driver_court.3608d5e1.html">the boy had driven several times, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour</a>.” It was noted in passing in May 2007 that <a href="http://www.tdn.com/articles/2007/05/03/area_news/news13.txt"> the adult pled not guilty to vehicular manslaughter charges</a>. </p>
<p> Conclusion: As part of a plea agreement, <a href="http://www.kptv.com/news/15365488/detail.html"> the adult was sentenced to five years in prison plus probation</a>. </p>
