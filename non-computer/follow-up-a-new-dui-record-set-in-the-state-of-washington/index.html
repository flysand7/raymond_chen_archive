<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Follow-up: A new DUI record set in the state of Washington</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A year ago, I noted that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/02/6950841.aspx"> a new DUI record had been set for the state of Washington</a>. It took a while, but the story finally settled out.</p>
<p> Recapping the story so far (links in the original article): The driver’s attorneys eventually succeeded in having her released from jail (where she had been held on $300,000 bail) to a treatment center. </p>
<p> In April 2008, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004358166_apwaduiguilty.html"> the driver pled guilty to driving while intoxicated</a> and in June 2008 was sentenced to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008022427_dui28m.html"> one year in prison</a> for that offense, plus additional days for other offenses, totalling 440 days in jail; plus 90 days of electronic home monitoring, fines, attendance at alcohol-education classes, and other unspecified penalties. That last article also runs down the four separate traffic incidents the driver has been involved in: Driving on the shoulder past a line of stopped cars and becoming involved in a three-car collision, the incident which raised so much public attention. A hit-and-run accident. And two more incidents of driving while intoxicated. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/02/6950841.aspx#6958028"> Unfortunately</a>, permanent suspension of driving privileges was not listed among the penalties. </p>
<p> Other high blood alcohol levels: </p>
