<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Marriage as a cross-branding opportunity</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://entertainment.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4459,11894472%255E10431%255E%255Enbv,00.html"> Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt have decided to besmirch the institution of marriage</a> by deciding that the “until death do us part” thing was neither legally nor morally binding.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> “Brad said that they spent the rest of the holiday working out how they would release the news of the split. They worked out together the reasons they would give and how they would <strong>protect the brand they have built up</strong>.” </p></blockquote>
<p> Oh, nevermind. This wasn’t a marriage. It was a joint branding agreement!</p>
<p> My favorite Brad/Jennifer memory was when cardiologist Robert Atkins, famous for his eponymous low-carb diet, suffered a fatal head injury, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2937849.stm"> the BBC news report was illustrated with a picture of… Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston</a>. </p>
