<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The hardest part of writing the video game Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, I happened to have lunch with one of the programmers who worked on the video game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1887889000?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>Monty Python’s Complete Waste of Time</i></a> (<a href="http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/58/">read a review</a>). This program was notable in many ways, most geekily that it was brought on board the Mir space station by astronaut <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/foale.html"> Michael Foale</a>.
 Anyway, during the course of lunch, I learned something unusual:
 “The hardest part of writing that program? Synchronizing the farts [sounds] to the video.”
