<p>As I was heading home at the end of the day, I ran into one of my colleagues who was also going home, and he was carrying a <i>Star Wars</i>-themed metal lunchbox similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007COUJNA/?tag=tholneth-20"> this one</a>. For those who didn’t grow up in the United States, these metal lunchboxes are the type of things elementary school children use to carry their lunch to school.
 I remarked, “Nice lunchbox.”
 My colleague explained, “Yeah, I sort of ended up as the lunchbox guy. It started when somebody gave me a lunchbox as a semi-humorous gift, and I kept it on my shelf. Then other people saw that I had a metal lunchbox and concluded, ‘Oh, he must collect metal lunchboxes,’ and they started giving me metal lunchboxes. And before I knew it, I became an unwitting collector of metal lunchboxes.”
 The same thing happened to a different colleague of mine. As his first birthday after he got married approached, his new in-laws asked his wife, “What does Bob like?”
 His wife shrugged. “I dunno. He kind of likes Coca-Cola?”
 That year, he got a vintage Coca-Cola serving tray. The next year, he got a Coca-Cola clock. And then Coca-Cola drinking glasses. And so on.</p>
<p> Eventually, he had to  ask his wife to tell her family, “Okay, you can stop now. Bob doesn’t like Coca-Cola <i>that</i> much.” </p>
