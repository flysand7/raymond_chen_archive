<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Bowling coming to Bellevue, and given the location, it's naturally upscale</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/01/4155463.aspx"> Lincoln Square</a> mall in Bellevue will have a new tenant: An upscale bowling all^H^H^Hlounge. <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/323059_bizbriefs10.html"> Expected to open before the Christmas holiday season</a>, there will be two bars, full-service dining, lots of big plasma screens, all the stuff that makes bowling better. The lounge be positioned on the second floor, beneath <a href="http://www.parlorbilliards.com/"> Parlor Billiards</a>, a business which by a fantastic coincidence has exactly the same business model as the bowling all^H^H^Hlounge, but with billiards instead of bowling. By Christmastime, the 23,900 square foot venue will be the site of strikes, splits, and, no doubt, lots of failed <a href="http://www.jimloy.com/bowling/spares.htm"> pick-up</a> attempts.</p>
