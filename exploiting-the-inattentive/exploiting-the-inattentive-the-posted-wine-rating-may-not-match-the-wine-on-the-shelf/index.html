<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploiting the inattentive: The posted wine rating may not match the wine on the shelf</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The <i>Washington Post</i> did a spot check of area wine stores and found that of the “shelf talkers” signs (those things that describe the wine and tell you what score it received from <i>Wine Spectator</i> magazine) it found, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/22/AR2007122200399.html"> a quarter of them were incorrect</a>, usually by attributing a good score to the correct wine vineyard but from a different year. So when you cruise the wine store, make sure to double-check that the information placard actually matches the wine it’s posted next to.</p>
