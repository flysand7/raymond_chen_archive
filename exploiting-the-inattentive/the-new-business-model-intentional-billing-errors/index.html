<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The new business model: Intentional billing errors</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Just in the last month, I had to call a bank to reverse four erroneous “Account Maintenance Fees” across two different accounts. It appears that <a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2011-05-04/"> intentional billing errors</a> is the new business model for our struggling economy. (For the record, although I am responsible for maintaining these accounts, I did not open the accounts at the bank in question. My personal account is at a credit union.)
 One of my friends remarked, “I got only two. They must not really be trying yet.”</p>
<p> Many years ago, back when the dot-com bubble appeared unpoppable, a different friend of mine happened to meet somebody who sheepishly admitted that one of his previous jobs was at a what-we-can-euphemistically-call “adult online entertainment” site, where he was responsible for developing algorithms to determine which customers could safely be double- or even triple-billed. </p>
