<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploiting the inattentive, episode 3: Confusing movie titles</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In early 1997, the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116329/"><i>Fly Away Home</i></a>, a film about a teenage girl and her father rescuing a family of geese (<a href="http://www.operationmigration.org/fly_away_home.html">inspired by <i>Operation Migration</i></a>), was released on DVD. the movie was <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fly_away_home/"> well-reviewed</a> and even earned an Academy Award nomination. The very same weekend, the movie with the very similar name <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119138/"> <i>Follow Me Home</i></a> was released in theaters. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/follow_me_home/?critic=columns"> Its critical reception</a> was less favorable. Coincidence? Or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/11/695515.aspx"> exploiting the inattentive</a>?</p>
