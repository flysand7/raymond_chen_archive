<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploiting the inattentive</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The makers of a certain major brand of detergent which I will not name (but which for the purposes of this discussion will be called “Snide”) appears to take every step to exploit inattentive customers.</p>
<p> A box of Snide detergent powder comes with instructions indicating that for a normal-sized load, you should use 3/8 cup of detergent; for a large load, 1/2 cup. </p>
<p> The detergent box also comes with a handy measuring cup. </p>
<p> The measuring cup holds 5/8 cup of detergent. </p>
<p> Not to be outdone, Liquid Snide plays a similar trick. </p>
<p> The instructions indicate that for a normal-sized load, you should fill the cup to line 1 (the lowest line). For a large load, fill to line 2. If you look at the cup they provide, there is also a line 3 which is even higher than lines 1 and 2. Not even counting the imaginary “line 4” which is what you get if you fill the cup to the brim. </p>
<p> Just because it comes with a measuring cup doesn’t mean you have to use it. </p>
