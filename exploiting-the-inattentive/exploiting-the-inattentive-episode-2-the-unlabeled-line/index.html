<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Exploiting the inattentive, episode 2: The unlabeled line</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/16/258223.aspx"> Episode 1</a> we learned that “Snide” brand powdered laundry detergent comes with a scoop that holds 5/8 cup detergent, even though the directions call for only 3/8 cup. The intent here is to get people to use more detergent than necessary, thereby increasing sales. A box of detergent which should be sufficient for 30 loads ends up running out after only 18. Consider it “technically legal” mislabeling.
 I returned to Snide brand powdered laundry detergent this week and discovered that they have taken this little trick to a new level. The markings on the side of the scoop read like this:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" style="border: solid .75pt black">
<tr style="height: 2em">
<td> </td>
<td align="CENTER" style="width: 10em;border-bottom: solid .75pt black" valign="bottom"><font size="-2">2</font> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 2em">
<td> </td>
<td align="CENTER" style="width: 10em;border-bottom: solid .75pt black" valign="bottom"><font size="-2">1</font> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 1em">
<td> </td>
<td style="width: 10em;border-bottom: solid .75pt black">      </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 3em">
<td> </td>
<td style="width: 10em">      </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> The accompanying instructions give these instructions for how much detergent to use:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill to bottom line </td>
<td nowrap="">(3/8 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for normal loads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill to line 1 </td>
<td nowrap="">(1/2 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for large loads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill to line 2 </td>
<td nowrap="">(3/4 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for extra-soiled loads.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Notice that the amount of detergent you’re supposed to use on a regular basis is indicated by the <strong>bottom unmarked line</strong>, the one you will barely notice. Meanwhile, if you’re inattentive and use the entire scoop, you’ve used one cup of detergent, over twice as much as you were intending.</p>
<p> My prediction: The next time I buy Snide brand powdered laundry detergent, the scoop will be 1½ cups, with an unlabeled line at 1/2 cup, another line at 3/4 cup labeled “1” and a third line at 1 cup labeled “2”. The instructions will go something like this: </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill halfway to line 1 </td>
<td nowrap="">(3/8 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for normal loads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill to bottom line </td>
<td nowrap="">(1/2 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for large loads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="">Fill to line 1 </td>
<td nowrap="">(3/4 cup) </td>
<td nowrap="">for extra-soiled loads.</td>
</tr>
</table>
