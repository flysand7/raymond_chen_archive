<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The evolution of menu templates: Introduction</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/24/164737.aspx"> As with dialog templates</a>, menu templates have also gone through a four-stage evolutionary process. People don’t often generate menu templates in code, although the <code>LoadMenuIndirect</code> function is there waiting for you once you get the urge. As a result, there aren’t many questions from people trying to generate menu templates dynamically, but I’m going to go into the history of menu templates anyway, just out of a sense of completeness. </p>
<p> If you’re having problems with your dynamically-generated menu templates, you can ask the resource compiler to tell you what you’re doing wrong by createing a *.rc file for it and compiling it into a scratch program. Dump the resource as bytes, and there’s your answer. Same trick we used for dialog templates. </p>
