<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Where did the names of the fonts Marlett and Verdana come from?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter BAA says that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/16/10256947.aspx#10257580"> the -lett part of Marlett comes from the designer Virginia Howlett</a>. BAA adds, “I forget the ‘Mar’ but I believe it was a co-creator.”</p>
<p> If so, then that co-creator was Suzan <u>Mar</u>ashi, if Vincent Connare is to be trusted. On page 17 of the PDF document <a href="http://www.connare.com/darkside.pdf"><i>From The Dark Side…</i></a>, Connare identifies the authors of the font as Virginia Howlett, Rom Impas, Suzan Marashi, and Alison Grauman-Barnes. He also identifies Eliyezer Kohen as the person whose idea it was to use a special-purpose font. </p>
<p> According to Virginia Howlett, the original name for the font Verdana was <a href="http://www.dmxzone.com/go?6669&amp;LinkFile=page2.htm"> Ventana</a>, which means <i>window</i> in Spanish. Lawyers apparently objected to the name, and the font team explored variations on <i>verde</i> (which means <i>green</i> in Spanish) and <i>verdigris</i> (a green pigment), thereby invoking the color associated both with Washington (<i>The Evergreen State</i>) and Seattle (<i>The Emerald City</i>). The second part of the font name comes from Howlett’s granddaughter Ana, following in the tradition of font designers naming fonts after their daughters. </p>
