<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When was the last time you formatted a floppy disk?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> For some reason, I was reminded of the people who pooh-poohed Windows 95 because it didn’t format floppy disks smoothly. Who spends all day formatting floppy disks? Even in 1995, when you bought a box of floppy disks, they came pre-formatted!</p>
