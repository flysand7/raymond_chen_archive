<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is Rundll32 called Rundll32 and not just Rundll?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There is an oft-abused program named <code>rundll32.exe</code>. Why does its name end in <code>32</code>? <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/09/10208136.aspx#10209012"> Why not just call it <code>rundll.exe</code></a>? (I will for the moment ignore the rude behavior of calling people stupid under the guise of asking a question.)
 Because there needed to be a way to distinguish the 16-bit version from the 32-bit version.
 Windows 95 had  both <code>rundll.exe</code> (the 16-bit version) and <code>rundll32.exe</code> (the 32-bit version). Of course, with the gradual death of support for 16-bit Windows, the 16-bit <code>rundll.exe</code> is now just a footnote in history, leaving just the 32-bit version.
 But why did the two have to have different names? Why not just use the same name (<code>rundll.exe</code>) for both, putting the 16-bit version in the 16-bit system directory and the 32-bit version in the 32-bit system directory?
 Because Windows 95 didn’t have separate 16-bit and 32-bit system directories. There was just one system directory called <code>SYSTEM</code> and everything hung out there, both 16-bit and 32-bit, like one big happy family.
 Well, maybe not a happy family.</p>
<p> At any rate, when 64-bit Windows was introduced, the plan was not to do things the crazy mishmash way and instead separate the 32-bit files into one directory and the 64-bit files into a different directory. That way, no files needed to be renamed, and your batch file that ran <code>rundll32.exe</code> with some goofy command line still worked, even on 64-bit Windows. </p>
