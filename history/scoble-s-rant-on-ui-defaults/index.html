<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Scoble's rant on UI defaults</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</a> posted an entry in his <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/scobleizer/">Longhorn         blog</a> on the subject of what the UI defaults should be. It sure has stirred up         a lot of controvery. I may pick at the remarks over the upcoming days, but for now <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/scobleizer/posts/1679.aspx">I         posted responses to two of the comments he kicked up</a>.      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>We recently did a survey of users of all abilities. Beginners,     intermediates, experts: The number one complaint all of them had about the user interface     – 30% of all respondents mentioned this, evenly spread across all categories – was     “Too many icons on the desktop.” So it’s not just beginners. Experts also don’t like     the clutter. (Yes, I was surprised by the results, too.) </p></blockquote>
