<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why was nine the maximum number of monitors in Windows 98?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Windows 98 was the first version of Windows to support <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/monitor_53sj.asp"> multiple monitors</a>.  And the limit was nine.
 Why nine?
 Because that allowed you to arrange your monitors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLGG5AWJf7M#t=1m3s">like this</a>. You have early seventies television to thank.</p>
