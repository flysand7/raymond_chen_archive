<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The old DEBUG program can load COM files bigger than 64KB, but that doesn't mean they actually load as a program</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some times ago, I described <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/30/519388.aspx#525187"> why a corrupted binary sometimes results in the error “Program too big to fit in memory”</a>. Commenter Neil was under the impression that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/30/519388.aspx#525187"> nonrelocatable programs files could be larger than 64KB</a> and used the DEBUG command to verify this assertion.
 While it’s true that DEBUG can load files bigger than 64KB, that doesn’t mean that they will load as a program. If DEBUG decide that you didn’t give it a program (the file extension is not EXE or COM),¹ then it treats the file on the command line as a data file and loads it into memory in its entirety, provided it fits in memory in its entirety. When it does this, the <code>BX</code> register contains the upper 16 bits of the file size, and <code>CX</code> contains the lower 16 bits. This is also the format that is used when writing files back out: Use the <code>n</code> command to set the name of the output file and set <code>BX:CX</code> to the file size.
 Even though DEBUG has been obsolete for over a decade, it is still useful for exactly this purpose: You can use it as a hex editor for files less than around 512KB.
 But don’t deceive yourself into thinking that you created a COM file that is bigger than 64KB.</p>
<p> ¹There is another extension which has special meaning to DEBUG, but it’s not relevant to the discussion. </p>
