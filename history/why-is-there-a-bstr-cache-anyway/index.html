<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is there a BSTR cache anyway?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>Sys­Alloc­String</code> function uses a cache of <code>BSTR</code>s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/27/9929238.aspx">which can mess up your performance tracing</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2004/09/28/235304.aspx">There is a switch for disabling it for debugging purposes</a>, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/23/10259472.aspx#10259779">why does the cache exist at all</a>? </p>
<p>The <code>BSTR</code> cache is a historical artifact. When <code>BSTR</code>s were originally introduced, performance tracing showed that a significant chunk of time was spent merely allocating and freeing memory in the heap manager. Using a cache reduced the heap allocation overhead significantly. </p>
<p>In the intervening years, um, decades, the performance of the heap manager has improved to the point where the cache isn’t necessary any more. But the <code>Sys­Alloc­String</code> people can’t get rid of the <code>BSTR</code> because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/23/10259472.aspx">so many applications unwittingly rely on it</a>. </p>
<p>The <code>BSTR</code> cache is now a compatibility constraint. </p>
