<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How did Windows open a portal to another dimension when reporting a program error?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>For a brief period of time, an Insider build of Windows 10 changed the program crash dialog from <i>Windows is checking for a solution to the problem</i> to <i>Windows is opening a portal to another dimension</i>. How did Windows open that portal?</p>
<p>Man, that research department is working overtime.</p>
<p>Sorry to break it to you, but there was no actual portal to another dimension. That placeholder text was created by a friend of mine while the team worked with the writers to figure out what the new text should be. (The text ultimately became <i>Hang on while Windows reports the problem to Microsoft</i>.) My friend noted, “We <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/6kaqvz/windows_is_opening_a_portal_to_another_dimension/"> made Reddit</a>. My daughter was proud. I also learned that some people don’t want humor in their error messages.”</p>
<p>At least that message was better than the message in the original specification for the feature, which was “Program X has suffered a debilitating brain aneurysm,” a reference to <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/04/"> an old <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> comic</a>.</p>
