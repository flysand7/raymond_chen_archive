<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How did the scopes for the CryptProtectMemory function end up in a strange order?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A few weeks ago, I left an exercise: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/13/10607036.aspx">Propose a theory as to why the names and values of the scopes for the <code>Crypt­Protect­Memory</code> function are the way they are</a>. </p>
<p>I didn’t know the answer when I posed the exercise, but I went back and dug into it. </p>
<p>The <code>Crypt­Protect­Memory</code> function started out as an internal function back in Windows 2000, and when originally introduced, there were only two scopes: Within a process and cross-process. The Flags parameter therefore defined only a single bit, leaving the other bits reserved (must be zero). If the bottom bit was clear, then the memory was protected within a process; if the bottom bit was set, then the memory was protected across processes. </p>
<p>Later, the team realized that they needed to add a third scope, the one that corresponds to <code>CRYPT­PROTECT_SAME_LOGON</code>. They didn’t want to make a breaking change for existing callers, but they saw that they could retarget what used to be a Flags parameter as an Options parameter, and they added the new scope as a third option. </p>
<p>The numeric values remained unchanged, which meant that the new function was backward-compatible with existing callers. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Commenter sense is correct that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/13/10607036.aspx#10607280"><code>SAME_LOGON</code> can be used by a service while impersonating the client</a>, however it is not the case that the scope can be larger when impersonating a remote user. The memory block returned by the <code>Crypt­Protect­Memory</code> function can be decrypted only on the same machine that encrypted it, and only as long as the machine has not been rebooted. </p>
