<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are structure names different from their typedef names?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
In Windows header files, many structures
are declared like this:
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct tagXYZ {
 ...
} XYZ;
typedef struct _XYZ {
 ...
} XYZ;
/* there are other variations, too */
</pre>
<p>
Why is the structure name different from typedef name?
</p>
<p>
This is a holdover from very early versions of the C language
where structure tags, union tags,
and typedefs were kept in the same namespace.
Consequently, you couldn’t say
<code>typedef struct XYZ { ... } XYZ;</code>.
At the open brace, the compiler registers <code>XYZ</code>
as a structure tag name, and then when <code>XYZ</code> appears
a second time, you get a redeclaration error.
The standard workaround for this was to make the structure tag name
a minor modification of the typedef name,
most typically by putting the word <code>tag</code> in front.
</p>
<p>
The C language standardization process separated the structure
and typename name spaces, so this workaround is no longer necessary,
but it doesn’t hurt either.
Besides, even if new structures followed the
<code>typedef struct XYZ { ... } XYZ;</code> pattern,
you would just have people asking,
“Why do some structures in <code>winuser.h</code> use
the <code>tagXYZ</code> pattern and others use the <code>XYZ</code>
pattern?
Why can’t it just be consistent?”
</p>
<p>
Next time, why you also don’t see the pattern
<code>typedef struct { ... } XYZ</code> very much either.</p>
