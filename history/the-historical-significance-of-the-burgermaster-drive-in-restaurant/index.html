<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The historical significance of the Burgermaster drive-in restaurant</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>From 1981 to 1986, Microsoft was headquartered at what was then known as the Northup Building, 10700 Northup Way in Bellevue. A long time ago, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091203045556/http://www.microspotting.com/2009/01/raymond-chen"> I told a story about the La Quinta Inn next to that building</a>. The building on the other side also plays a significant role in the history of Microsoft. That building is the Burgermaster restaurant.</p>
<p>In Windows 3.0, the data segment that recorded the locations of all the other data segments was named the BurgerMaster.¹ Why?</p>
<p>According to one story, the developer couldn’t think of a good name, so he looked out his window, saw the big sign that said <i style="font-variant: all-small-caps;">BURGERMASTER</i>, and decided to name it <i>BurgerMaster</i>.</p>
<p>Although the capitalization of the restaurant name is <i>Burgermaster</i>, the sign is printed in all-caps, and the developer erroneously capitalized it as <i>BurgerMaster</i> with a capital <i>M</i>.</p>
<p>Another story is that the segment is named <i>BurgerMaster</i> because it is the most important segment in Windows, just like how the Burgermaster restaurant is the most important restaurant for Windows developers.</p>
<p>The Burgermaster restaurant was so important that <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2009/10/rip_mr_burgermaster.html"> Bill Gates’s secretary kept it on speed dial</a>. In fact, it wasn’t just on speed dial for Bill Gates’s secretary. It was a <i>company-wide</i> speed dial number. You could call them to order a burger, walk next door, and your order would be ready and waiting for you. This was a novelty back in the 1980s, though nowadays it sounds so old-fashioned to phone in a take-out order instead of using an app.</p>
<p>¹ At some point, it was given a much less whimsical name: The <i>global master handle</i>. But the comments in the code still call it the BurgerMaster.</p>
