<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dark Pattern: Opt-in above the fold, but opt-out below the fold</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my colleagues reminded me of a <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/"> Dark Pattern</a> employed by the installer for the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180611-00/?p=98965"> media player for that internet protocol</a> that got the rug pulled out from under it.</p>
<p>When you got to the shovelware portion of the installer, it showed you this:</p>

<p>You see that everything is unchecked, so you click <i>Next</i>.</p>
<p>You have fallen into the trap.</p>
<p>Look at that scroll bar on the right hand side. It’s scrolled only partway through the list. And if you had scrolled down the list, you would have seen this:</p>

<p>That’s right. All the items you could see without scrolling were unchecked by default, but everything else was checked by default.</p>
<p>As my colleague noted, “This may be one of the few times where it cost more to be placed <i>below</i> the fold.”</p>
<p><b>Bonus reading</b>: One of the pieces of bundled software was <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031219-00/?p=41423"> an app that wants to crash</a>.</p>
