<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is there the message '!Do not use this registry key' in the registry?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Under <code>Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current­Version\Explorer\Shell Folders</code>, there is a message to registry snoopers: The first value is called “!Do not use this registry key” and the associated data is the message “Use the SH­Get­Folder­Path or SH­Get­Known­Folder­Path function instead.”
 I added that message.
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/03/55532.aspx"> The long and sad story of the Shell Folders key</a> explains that the registry key exists only to retain backward compatibility with four programs written in 1994. There’s also <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2005.11.windowsconfidential.aspx"> a TechNet version of the article</a> which is just as sad but not as long.
 One customer saw this message and complained, “That registry key and that TechNet article explain how to <i>obtain</i> the current locations of those special folders, but they don’t explain how to <i>change</i> them. This type of woefully inadequate documentation only makes the problem worse.”
 Hey, wow, a little message in a registry key and a magazine article are now “documentation”! The TechNet article is historical background. And the registry key is just a gentle nudge. Neither is documentation. It’s not like I’m going to put a complete copy of the documentation into a registry key. Documentation lives in places like MSDN.
 But it seems that some people need more than a nudge; they need a shove. Let’s see, we’re told that the functions for obtaining the locations of known folders are <code>SH­Get­Folder­Path</code> and its more modern counterpart <code>SH­Get­Known­Folder­Path</code>. I wonder what the names of the functions for modifying those locations might be?
 Man that’s a tough one. I’ll let you puzzle that out for a while.
 Okay, here, I’ll tell you: The corresponding functions go by the completely unobvious names <code>SH­<u>Set­</u>Folder­Path</code> and <code>SH­<u>Set­</u>Known­Folder­Path</code>.</p>
<p> Sorry you had to use your brain. I’ll let you get back to programming now. </p>
