<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">But I have Visual Basic Professional</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Back in 1995, I was participating in a chat room on MSN on the subject of device driver development. One of the people in the chat room asked, “Can I write a device driver in Visual Basic?”</p>
<p> I replied, “Windows 95 device drivers are typically written in low-level languages such as C or even assembly language.” </p>
<p> Undaunted, the person clarified: “But I have Visual Basic <strong>Professional</strong>.” </p>
