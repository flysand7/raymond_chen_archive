<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Changing the Windows boot logo</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         This is the answer I give to IT people when they ask if it’s okay to customize the         Windows boot logo.      </p>
<p>         DO NOT DO THIS ON A PRODUCTION MACHINE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.      </p>
<p>         If you hack the bitmap everything will seem fine until six months down the road when         you decide to install the latest service pack. The service pack installer <u>will         not upgrade your ntoskrnl</u> because it looks at the file and says “Hm, this isn’t         the standard uniprocessor ntoskrnl, it’s not the standard multiprocessor ntoskrnl,         it’s not the standard advanced server ntoskrnl, I can’t tell what this is, so I don’t         know which version of ntoskrnl to update it to. I’ll just leave it alone.”      </p>
<p>         If you are lucky you will <u>bluescreen at boot</u> because the old ntoskrnl is incompatible         with some other critical part of the service pack.      </p>
<p>         If you are unlucky, your machine will <u>appear to run normally</u> when in fact it         is quietly corrupting itself, and then it will keel over or generate bogus data when         you least expect it.      </p>
<p>         If you planned ahead, you will have <u>quit your job and moved to Hawaii</u> so the         disaster falls on your replacement’s head to clean up while you sit on the beach sipping         a pina colada.      </p>
