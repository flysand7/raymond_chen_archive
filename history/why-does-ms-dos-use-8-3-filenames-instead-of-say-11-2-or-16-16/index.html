<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does MS-DOS use 8.3 filenames instead of, say, 11.2 or 16.16?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I discussed years ago  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/02/2008357.aspx"> why operating system files tend to follow the old 8.3 file name convention</a>, I neglected to mention why the old MS-DOS filename convention was 8.3 and not, say, 11.2 or 16.16.</p>
<p> It’s a holdover from CP/M. </p>
<p> As I noted when I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/17/6785519.aspx"> discussed the old MS-DOS wildcard matching rules</a>, MS-DOS <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/16/90448.aspx"> worked hard at being compatible with CP/M</a>. And CP/M used 8.3 filenames. </p>
<p> Why did CP/M use 8.3 filenames? I don’t know. There’s nothing obvious in the <a href="http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/Cpm/format14.html"> CP/M directory format</a> that explains why those two reserved bytes couldn’t have been used to extend the file name to 10.3. But maybe they figured that eight was a convenient number. </p>
