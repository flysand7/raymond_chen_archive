<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the maximum boot.ini delay 11 million seconds?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I mentioned in passing that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx"> the maximum delay you can specify in boot.ini is about 11 million seconds</a>. I’m disappointed but sadly not surprised that everybody focused on that number and completely missed the point of the article.</p>
<p> First of all, the value of 11 million was not a conscious limitation. It’s just an artifact of other limitations. The delay is specified in seconds in boot.ini, but internally it is converted to BIOS clock ticks. (Remember, this is a boot loader; there’s not much infrastructure available yet.) The conversion is done in 32-bit arithmetic, and 4 billion BIOS clock ticks at 18.2 ticks per second is about 110 million seconds. </p>
<p> <i>Wait, but you said 11 million seconds, not 110 million seconds.</i> </p>
<p> Well, yes, but the conversion is done in 32-bit integer arithmetic: <code>BiosTicks = BootIniSeconds * 182 / 10</code>. A value for BootIniSeconds larger than about 11 million  will result in a signed integer overflow in the intermediate product. </p>
<p> That’s why the limit is 11 million seconds. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5472869"> It’s a storage limitation, not an arbitrary cutoff</a>. And it is indeed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5473542"> the limit of a natural data type</a>, just hidden behind some other computations. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5475875">SB</a> figured this out, though I fear that this shout-out will only serve to encourage people to speculate even more wildly than they already do in the hopes of earning a future shout-out.) </p>
<p> Now you’d think this would be plenty enough of a boot delay. I mean, it’s already much longer than the maximum amount you can delay with a single call to <code>Sleep</code> or <code>WaitForSingleObject</code>. And who would ever need a computer to pause <i>four months</i> before booting? Yet there’s one commenter who thought 11 million seconds wasn’t enough: “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5471717">What if I want a timeout of 129 days?</a>” If you need a timeout of 129 days, then <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5472287"> go buy a custom hardware timer device that waits 129 days after the onset of power before allowing current to flow</a>. This same commenter has difficulty comprehending that just because you’re capable of delaying something for a specific length of time and you’re capable of never doing it at all, that doesn’t mean that you are also capable of delaying something for an arbitrary length of time. </p>
<p> One commenter suggested that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/16/5465592.aspx#5472524"> the problem could be solved by using a bignum library</a>. Before you solve a problem, you first have to be sure that what you have really is a problem in the first place. I have yet to hear of any customers who are running into the 11 million second limit. Using bignums here would be a solution in search of a problem. “Hey, let’s consume valuable developer and tester resources in order to add a bunch of code to a tightly-constrained environment to cover a case that <i>nobody cares about</i>.” (And I failed to live up to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/25/8880082.aspx#8894393"> my promise to Ulric</a> merely to incorporate this lecture by reference in the future.) </p>
