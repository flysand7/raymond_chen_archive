<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Excuse me, has anybody seen the FOCAL interpreter?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my now-retired colleagues joined Microsoft <a href="/history/from-microsoft-s-mail-room-to-the-board-room"> back in the early days when Steve Ballmer was the mail boy</a>.</p>
<p>As I noted, the company at the time was very small. An order arrived in the mail (because that’s how you ordered software back then) for a copy of what I vaguely recall was Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)"> FOCAL</a>, but don’t quote me on that. (I used to a have a copy of a FOCAL manual, but I misplaced it decades ago.)</p>
<p>FOCAL was a simple interpreted programming language similar to BASIC in many ways, but far less popular. Orders for it came in very infrequently.</p>
<p>The FOCAL software was available on paper tape, or if you wanted to splurge, you could order it on plastic tape for extra durability.</p>
<p>Anyway, the order came in, the first order in ages. But there was a problem: Nobody could find the master tape! We lost our only copy of the software.</p>
<p>The order had to be canceled, with an apology that the product had been discontinued.</p>
<p>What we didn’t mention is that it was discontinued because we had lost it.</p>
