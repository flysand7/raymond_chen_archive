<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't C# have "const"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>  I was going to write about why C# doesn’t have “const”,  but  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/">Stan Lippman</a>  already discussed this in  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/archive/2004/01/22/61712.aspx">  A Question of Const</a>, so now I don’t have to.  </p>
<p>  (And another example of synchronicity:  After I wrote up this item and tossed it into the queue,  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/04/22/118238.aspx">  Eric Gunnerson took up the topic as well</a>.  </p>
