<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s the difference between HWND_TOP and HWND_TOPMOST?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The special values <code>HWND_TOP</code> and <code>HWND_TOPMOST</code> have similar names but do completely different things when passed as the <code>hWndInsertAfter</code> parameter to the <code>DeferWindowPos</code> function (or its moral equivalents such as <code>SetWindowPos</code>). As a backgrounder, you should start off by reading <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Windows/WindowReference/WindowFunctions/DeferWindowPos.asp"> the MSDN discussion</a>, which is perfectly accurate as far as it goes. Here, I’ll discuss the issue from a historical perspective in the hopes that looking at it from a different direction may improve understanding.</p>
<p> Sibling windows are maintained in an order called the Z-order. (For the purpose of this discussion, top-level windows are also treated as siblings. In fact, it is the Z-order of top-level windows that most people think of when they say “Z-order”.) </p>
<p> The Z-order should be visualized as a vertical stack, with windows “above” or “below” siblings. </p>
<p> Before Windows 3.0, the behavior was simple: <code>HWND_TOP</code> brings the window to the top of the Z-order. </p>
<p> Windows 3.0 added the concept of “topmost” windows. These are top-level windows that always remain “above” non-topmost windows. To make a window topmost, call <code>DeferWindowPos</code> (or one of its moral equivalents) with <code>HWND_TOPMOST</code> as the <code>hWndInsertAfter</code>. To make a window non-topmost, use <code>HWND_NOTOPMOST</code>. </p>
<p> As a result of the introduction of “topmost” windows, <code>HWND_TOP</code> now brings the window “as high in the Z-order as possible without violating the rule that topmost windows always appear above non-topmost windows”. What does this mean in practice? </p>
<ul>
<li>If a window is topmost, then     <code>HWND_TOP</code> puts it at the very top of the Z-order. </li>
<li>If a window is not topmost, then     <code>HWND_TOP</code> puts it at the top of all non-topmost windows     (i.e., just below the lowest topmost window, if any). </li>
</ul>
<p> Note: The above discussion completely ignores the issue of owner and owned windows. I left them out because they would add a layer of complication that distracts from the main topic. </p>
