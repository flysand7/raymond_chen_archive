<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Holding down the shift key when right-clicking lets you pin things to the Start menu even when you might have been better off not doing so</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/22/4500831.aspx"> Holding the shift key when calling up a context menu</a> is a convention for indicating that you want to see additional advanced options which are normally hidden. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/22/4500831.aspx#4510836"> One of those options is <i>Pin to Start menu</i></a>. What is this doing as an extended command?
 The <i>Pin to Start menu</i> command normally appears on the context menu of a program or a shortcut to a program. The Start menu pin list was intended to be a launch point for programs, so if the item you pick isn’t actually a program, the <i>Pin to Start menu</i> item will be hidden. Furthermore, only items on the local hard drive will show <i>Pin to Start menu</i>. This avoids ugliness if the user accidentally pins <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/29/9941779.aspx#9942073"> a file on a network drive</a> or removable media, and the network is down or the removable media is removed. (Or, if the removable media is a floppy drive or CD-ROM, freaking out the user by spinning up the drive to get the properties of the shortcut.)
 The shift key override was aded as an escape hatch, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/14/466051.aspx"> like the double-Ctrl+Alt+Del</a>, in case there was some situation discovered after Windows XP shipped where it would be reasonable to pin a non-program or a shortcut on network or removable media to the Start menu. For example, ClickOnce application are not recognized as executables because their extension is not .exe but rather is .appref-ms. But you can use the shift key override to pin them to your Start menu.
 With great power comes great responsibility: If you manually override the <i>Pin to Start menu</i> logic, then it’s your problem if you pin something that ends up making your life miserable.</p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Upon closer examination, I’ve discovered that my characterization of what the shift keys accomplishes was incorrect. The shift key does not let you force-pin files on the network or removable media. It only lets you force-pin files that aren’t programs. </p>
