<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When people ask for security holes as features: Stealing passwords</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sometimes people ask for features that are such blatant security holes I don’t know what they were thinking.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Is there a way to get the current user’s password? I have a program that does some stuff, then reboots the system, and I want to have the current user’s password so I can log that user back in when I’m done, then my program can resume its operation. </p></blockquote>
<p> (Sometimes they don’t bother explaining why they need the user’s password; <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc/msg/ee93a9a4aa1da63e"> they just ask for it</a>.)
 Imagine the fantastic security hole if this were possible. Anybody could write a program that steals your password <strong>without even having to trick you into typing it</strong>. They would just call the imaginary <code>GetPasswordOfCurrentUser</code> function and bingo! they have your password.
 For another angle on credential-stealing, read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/">Larry Osterman</a>‘s discussion of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/06/29/169085.aspx"> why delegation doesn’t work over the network</a>.
 Even if you didn’t want the password itself but merely some sort of “cookie” that could be used to log the user on later, you still have a security hole. Let’s call this imaginary function <code>GetPasswordCookieOfCurrentUser</code>; it returns a “cookie” that can be used to log the user on instead of using their password.</p>
<p> This is just a thinly-disguised <code>GetPasswordOfCurrentUser</code> because that “cookie” is <strong>equivalent to a password</strong>. Log on with the cookie and you are now that person. </p>
