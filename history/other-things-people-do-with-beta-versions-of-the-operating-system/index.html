<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Other things people do with beta versions of the operating system</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Somewhat belatedly riffing on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/">Larry</a> and his discussion of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/08/10/450173.aspx"> time bombs in beta products</a>, I’m reminded of one instance of a major PC manufacturer who apparently couldn’t wait for Windows 95 to RTM. Tired of waiting, they shipped several thousands of machines with a late beta version of Windows 95 instead.
 That worked out really great.  For six months.
 And then all the computers expired.</p>
<p> Boy did they have a lot of ‘splainin’ to do. </p>
