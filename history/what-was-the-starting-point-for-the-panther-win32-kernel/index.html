<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What was the starting point for the Panther Win32 kernel?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When I presented a list of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/20/10526823.aspx">cat-related code names from Windows 95</a>, commenter dave wanted to know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/20/10526823.aspx#10527070">whether the Panther kernel was derived from the 32-bit DOS kernel or the Windows/386 kernel</a>. </p>
<p>Neither. </p>
<p>Here’s the table again, with some more columns of information: </p>

<p>The original idea for the Jaguar and Cougar projects was to offer a 16-bit MS-DOS environment that could be “kicked up a notch” to a 32-bit protected-mode MS-DOS environment, with virtual memory and multiple virtual machines. They used the MS-DOS 5 and Win386 kernels as starting points. (Why wasn’t Jaguar based on MS-DOS 6.0? For the same reason <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/19/10117410.aspx">NASA didn’t use the Space Shuttle to rescue the Apollo 13 astronauts</a>.) This project as originally envisioned was cancelled, but the work was not lost. The projects took on new life as the Windows 95 boot loader / compatibility layer and as the Windows 95 virtual machine manager, respectively. </p>
<p>The idea for the Panther project was to start with the existing Windows NT kernel and strip it down to run in 4<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">MB</a> of RAM. This project did not pan out, and it was cancelled outright. It was replaced with a Win32 kernel written from scratch with the 4MB limit in mind. </p>
<p>The Stimpy project survived intact and became the Windows 95 user interface. </p>
<p>I doubt the code name was the reason, but it’s interesting that the ferocious cats did not carry out their original missions, but the dim-witted cat did. </p>
