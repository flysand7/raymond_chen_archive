Some people objected to

the length, the structure, the metaphors</a>,

the speculation, and fabrication</a>.
So let’s say they were my editors.
Here’s what the article might have looked like,
had I taken their recommendations.
(Some recommendations were to text that was also recommended cut.
I applied the recommendations before cutting;
the cuts are in gray.)

Back in the days of Windows 95 development,
one of my colleagues debugged
a line-of-business application for a major delivery service.
<font color="gray">
This was a program that the company gave to its top-tier
high-volume customers,
so that they could place and track their orders directly.
</font>
<font color="gray">And by <i>directly</i>,
I mean that the program
dialed the modem
(since that was how computers communicated with each other back then)
to contact
<strike><font color="gray">the delivery service’s mainframe
(it was all mainframes back then)</font></strike>
<u>a computer at the delivery service</u>
and upload the new orders
and download the status of existing orders.¹</font>

Version 1.0 of the application had a notorious bug:

it stopped working.

If you entered a particular type of

<strike>Here’s why it crashed:</strike>
After the program
dials up
<strike><font color="gray">the mainframe to submit the order</font></strike>
<u>the order system</u>,
it tries to refresh
<strike><font color="gray">the list of orders that have yet to be delivered</font></strike>
<u>a list box control</u>.
The code that does this assumes that
<strike><font color="gray">the list of undelivered orders</font></strike>
<u>the list box control</u>
is the control with focus.
But
<strike><font color="gray">if you ask for labels to be printed,
then the printing code changes focus in order to
display the “Please place the label on the package
exactly like this” dialog</font></strike>,
<u>under the specific circumstances,
the control is no longer focus;
as I recall, it was because a dialog box had appeared and changed focus</u>,
and as a result, the refresh code can’t find the
<strike><font color="gray">undelivered order list</font></strike>
<u>list box</u>
and crashes on a null pointer.

they fixed it by adding a null pointer exception handler.

Now, 16-bit Windows didn’t have structured exception handling.
The only type of exception handler was a global exception handler,

This was global to the entire system.
Your exception handler was called for every exception everywhere.
If you screwed it up, you screwed up the entire system.

These system-wide exception handlers had to be written in assembly

convention.

Their application was written in MFC,

(I don’t know if Visual C++ actually had an

they could just have copied the code from somewhere.)
Nevermind that these system-wide exception handlers are not
<code>HOOKPROC</code>s, so the function has the wrong prototype.
What’s more, the code they used marked the hook function
as <code>__loadds</code>.

The application crashes on a null pointer.
The system-wide custom exception handler is called.
The crash is not one that is being protected by the global variable,
so the custom exception handler frees the application from memory.
The system-wide custom exception handler now returns,
but wait, what is it returning to?

The crash was in the application,
which means that the <code>DS</code> register

The custom exception handler freed the application’s data

As the function exited,
it tried to restore the original <code>DS</code> register,
but the CPU said,
“Nice try,

Since an exception was raised,
the custom exception handler is called recursively.
Each time through the recursion, the custom exception handler
frees all the DLLs and memory associated with the application.
But that’s okay, right?
Because the second and subsequent times,
the memory was already freed,
so the attempts to free them again will just fail
with an invalid parameter error.

But wait, their list of DLLs associated
with the application included
<code>USER</code>,
<code>GDI</code>,

<code>KERNEL</code>.
Now, Windows is perfectly capable of unloading dependent DLLs
when you unload the main DLL,
so when they unloaded their main program, the kernel already
decremented
the usage count on
<code>USER</code>,
<code>GDI</code>,
and
<code>KERNEL</code> automatically.
<strike><font color="gray">But they apparently didn’t trust Windows to do this,
because after all,
it was Windows that was causing their application to crash,
so they took it upon themselves to free those DLLs manually.</font></strike>
