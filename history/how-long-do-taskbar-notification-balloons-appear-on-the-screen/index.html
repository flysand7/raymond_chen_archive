<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How long do taskbar notification balloons appear on the screen?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
We saw some time ago that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/10/349894.aspx">
taskbar notification balloons don’t penalize you for being away
from the computer</a>.
But how long does the balloon stay up when the user is there?
</p>
<p>
Originally, the balloon appeared for whatever amount of time
the application specified in the <code>uTimeout</code> member
of the <code>NOTIFYICONDATA</code> structure,
subject to a system-imposed minimum of 10 seconds and maximum
of 60 seconds.
</p>
<p>
In Windows XP, some animation was added to the balloon,
adding 2 seconds of fade-in and fade-out animation
to the display time.
</p>
<p>
Starting in Windows Vista,
applications are no longer allowed to specify how long they
wanted the balloon to appear;
the <code>uTimeout</code> member is ignored.
Instead, the display time is
the amount of time specified
by the <code>SPI_GETMESSAGEDURATION</code> system parameter,
with 1 second devoted to fade-in and
5 seconds devoted to fade-out, with a minimum of 3 seconds
of full visibility.
In other words,
if you set the message duration to less than
1+3+5=9 seconds,
the taskbar behaves as if you had set it to 9 seconds.
</p>
<p>
The default message duration is 5 seconds,
so in fact most systems are in the “shorted possible time”
case.
If you want to extend the time for which balloons notification appear,
you can use the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function to change it:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL SetMessageDuration(DWORD seconds, UINT flags)
{
 return SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETMESSAGEDURATION,
                             0, IntToPtr(seconds), flags);
}
</pre>
<p>
(You typically don’t need to mess with this setting, because
you can rescue a balloon from fading out by moving the mouse over it.)
</p>
<p>
Note that an application can also set the <code>NIF_REALTIME</code>
flag, which means
“If I can’t display the balloon <i>right now</i>, then just skip it.”</p>
