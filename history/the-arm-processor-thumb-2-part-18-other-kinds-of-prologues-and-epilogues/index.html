<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The ARM processor (Thumb-2), part 18: Other kinds of prologues and epilogues</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Last time, <a href="/history/the-arm-processor-thumb-2-part-17-prologues-and-epilogues"> we looked at the standard function prologue and epilogue</a>. There are some variations to the standard that you may encounter from time to time.</p>
<p>Lightweight leaf functions are functions which meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify only the non-preserved registers: <var>r0</var> through <var>r3</var> and <var>r12</var>, and <var>d0</var> through <var>d7</var> and <var>d16</var> through <var>r31</var>, and flags.</li>
<li>Do not use any stack aside from inbound parameter space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightweight leaf functions do not create a stack frame. They must keep the return address in the <var>lr</var> register for the entire lifetime so that the kernel can unwind the function to its caller. The requirement that it use only non-preserved registers allows the kernel to unwind without using any unwind codes, since there are no registers that need to be restored during unwinding.</p>
<p>Conversely, any function that lacks unwind codes is assumed to be a lightweight leaf function.</p>
<p>Another variation is the shrink-wrapped function. This is a function that starts out with a small stack frame (or no stack frame at all, pretending to be a lightweight leaf function), in the hope that it can early-out. If not, then it expands to a full stack frame.</p>
<p>If a function uses 16 or fewer bytes of local variables and outbound parameters, it can include up to four dummy registers to the initial <code>push</code>:</p>
<pre>    push    {r0-r7,r11,lr}
</pre>
<p>The part you recognize is the saving of registers <var>r4</var> through <var>r7</var>, plus the frame pointer and return address. The sneaky part is that it also saves registers <var>r0</var> through <var>r3</var>. These extra registers are pushed, not so much because the function wants to save them, but because pushing four additional registers implicitly subtracts 4 ×4 = 16 bytes from the <var>sp</var> register, allocating the local variables and outbound parameters as part of the initial <code>push</code>.</p>
<p>In the epilogue, you can use the reverse trick to clean up those extra 16 bytes as part of the final pop:</p>
<pre>    pop     {r0-r7,r11,pc}
</pre>
<p>However, if your function needs to return a value in <var>r0</var> (and possibly <var>r1</var>), you can’t pop them in your optimized epilogue, because that would clobber your return value. You’ll have to use an old-fashioned <code>add sp, sp, #n</code> to discard those bytes from the stack.</p>
<p>If the function is variadic, it will probably start with a</p>
<pre>    push    {r0-r3}
</pre>
<p>This pushes the first 16 bytes of parameters onto the stack, so that they line up exactly adjacent to the stack-based parameters. That way, the code that walks the parameter list can just walk through memory uniformly.</p>
<p>This extra push instruction in the prologue requires a change to the epilogue, because our usual trick of popping the return address into <var>pc</var> isn’t going to work.</p>
<pre>    add     sp, sp, #0x20       ; free locals and outbound stack parameters
    pop     {r4-r7,r11}         ; restore registers but leave return address
    ldr     pc, [sp], #0x14     ; return and clean extra stack space
</pre>
<p>Things start out innocently enough, but this time, the <code>pop</code> instruction leaves the return address on the stack, and the <var>r0</var> through <var>r3</var> registers are still on the stack, too. At this point, we have this diagram:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" frame="" style="border-collapse: collapse    TITLE=;">

<td style="border: solid 1px black; text-align: center;">saved <var>r0</var></td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid 1px black; text-align: center;">return address</td>
<td>← <var>sp</var></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The magic instruction that finishes the function is</p>
<pre>    ldr     pc, [sp], #0x14     ; return and clean extra stack space
</pre>
<p>Let’s take this instruction apart.</p>
<p>First, it loads <var>pc</var> from the stack pointer. Loading a value into <var>pc</var> acts like a jump instruction, so the next instruction to execute when this one is complete will be the instruction at the return address.</p>
<p>The <code>, #0x14</code> suffix means that this is using the post-increment addressing mode. After the register is loaded from memory, the base register (<var>sp</var>) is incremented by <code>0x14</code>. This moves the stack pointer past the saved return address as well as the 16 bytes occupied by the registers <var>r0</var> through <var>r3</var> we had pushed at function entry.</p>
<p>The last trick I’ll talk about is tail call optimization. The epilogue for this function goes like this:</p>
<pre>    add     sp, sp, #0x20       ; free locals and outbound stack parameters
    pop     {r4-r7,r11,lr}      ; restore registers and set lr to return address
    b       next_function
</pre>
<p>After cleaning up the local variables and outbound stack parameters, we pop off everything that we saved, but instead of putting the return address into <var>pc</var> like we usually do, we pop it back into <var>lr</var>. This preserves the requirement that on entry to a function, the <var>lr</var> register holds the return address. We can now jump directly to the entry point of the tail call target.</p>
<p>Well, that was an exciting tour of function prologues and epilogues. Next time, we’ll look at common code sequences you should learn to recognize.</p>
