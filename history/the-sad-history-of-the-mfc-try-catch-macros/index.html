<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The sad history of the MFC <code>TRY</code>/<code>CATCH</code> macros</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Why does MFC <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/exceptions-using-mfc-macros-and-cpp-exceptions?view=vs-2019"> define <code>TRY</code>/<code>CATCH</code> macros</a>? Why can’t it use standard C++ exception handling?</p>
<p>This is another case of asking <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110119-00/?p=11723"> why they didn’t use the Space Shuttle to rescue Apollo 13</a>.</p>
<p>MFC was first released in 1992. At that time, C++ was a cool new programming language that everybody was interested in. Back in the early days, there were no templates, there was no standard library, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180607-00/?p=98935"> no placement new</a>, no namespaces, and no exceptions.¹</p>
<p>That meant that the MFC team had to invent their own exceptions, which they did with macros like <code>TRY</code> and <code>CATCH</code>. These macros were deprecated in MFC 3.0 (released in 1994), but for compatibility the macros continue to exist so that pre-MFC-3.0 code remains source-level compatible. The macros now just do standard C++ <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> operations, although there’s a <code>_AFX_</code><code>OLD_</code><code>EXCEPTIONS</code> symbol you can define to make them revert to the old <code>setjmp</code>-based fake exception handling, for binary compatibility.</p>
<p>MSDN has a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/exceptions-converting-from-mfc-exception-macros?view=vs-2017"> guide to converting from MFC exceptions to C++ exceptions</a>. So convert your code already. You’ve had 25 years.</p>
<p>¹ This implies that a failed <code>new</code> didn’t throw a <code>std::bad_alloc</code> exception, seeing as neither namespaces nor exceptions existed yet! Instead, a failed <code>new</code> simply returned <code>NULL</code>.²</p>
<p>² The <code>nullptr</code> keyword wouldn’t exist for nearly 20 years.</p>
