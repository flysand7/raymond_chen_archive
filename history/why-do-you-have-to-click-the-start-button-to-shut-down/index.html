<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do you have to click the Start button to shut down?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         Short answer: The same reason you turn the ignition key to shut off your car.      </p>
<p>         Long answer: Back in the early days, the taskbar didn’t have a Start button. (In a         future history column, you’ll learn that back in the early days, the taskbar wasn’t         called the taskbar.)      </p>
<p>         Instead of the Start button, there were three buttons in the lower left corner. One         was the “System” button (icon: the Windows flag), one was the “Find” button (icon:         an eyeball), and the third was the “Help” button (icon: a question mark). “Find” and         “Help” are self-explanatory. The “System” button gave you this menu:      </p>

<p>         (“Arrange Windows” gave you options like “Cascade”, “Tile Horizontally”, that sort         of thing.)      </p>
<p>         Of course, over time, the “Find” and “Help” buttons eventually joined the “System”         button menu and the System button menu itself gradually turned into the Windows 95         Start menu.      </p>
<p>         But one thing kept getting kicked up by usability tests: People booted up the computer         and just sat there, unsure what to do next.      </p>
<p>         That’s when we decided to label the System button “Start”.      </p>
<p>         It says, “You dummy. Click here.” And it sent our usability numbers through the roof,         because all of a sudden, people knew what to click when they wanted to do something.      </p>
<p>         So why is “Shut down” on the Start menu?      </p>
<p>         When we asked people to shut down their computers, they clicked the Start button.      </p>
<p>         Because, after all, when you want to shut down, you have to start somewhere.      </p>
<p>         (Besides, if we also had a “Shut down” button next to the Start button, everybody         would be demanding that we get rid of it to save valuable screen real estate.)      </p>
