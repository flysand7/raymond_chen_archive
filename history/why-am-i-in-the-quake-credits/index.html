<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why am I in the Quake credits?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040861"> Anon wants to know why</a> I am listed in <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/quake/credits"> the credits for the video game Quake</a> under the “Special Thanks” section. “Were you an early tester/debugger?”
 I’ve never played a game of Quake in my entire life. I (and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/10/06/10071954.aspx"> most of the rest of the Windows 95 team</a>) played DOOM, but after a while, first-person-shooter games started giving me a headache. By the time Quake came out, I had already abandoned playing FPS games.
 I don’t remember what it was that I did specifically, but it was along the lines of helping them with various technical issues related to running under Windows. At the time, I was a kernel developer, and the advice I gave was almost certainly related to memory management and swapping.</p>
<p> Sorry it wasn’t anything exciting. </p>
