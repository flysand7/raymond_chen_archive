<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Whale Boy</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today is the tenth anniversary of Windows Live Messenger. My colleague Danny Glasser <a href="http://messengersays.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!5B410F7FD930829E!77942.entry"> provides some history behind the product</a>, and you can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNBplwf9N-M"> tenth anniversary celebration video</a> created for the occasion. And thus is inspired today’s Microspeak: <i>Whale Boy</i>.
 <i>Whale Boy</i> is the nickname for the pawn-shaped Messenger buddy icon. His normal state is green, but he changes color or picks up a piece of flair to indicate various changes in status, such as <i>busy</i> or <i>away</i>.
 I don’t know the etymology of the term, but I suspect it came from his somewhat rotund appearance.
 Sample usage (which I made up just now; not from an actual document): “Why don’t we light up Whale Boy when the user regains connectivity?”</p>
<p> Bonus Microsoft trivia: At timecode 3:40 in the video (spoiler alert!) Steve Liffick presents Whale Boy with a strange glass object. That is the Microsoft ten-year service award. Stick around for 25 years and <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2006/01/upgrade_to_the.html"> collect the entire set</a>! </p>
