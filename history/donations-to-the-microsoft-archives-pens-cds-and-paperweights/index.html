<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Donations to the Microsoft Archives: Pens, CDs, and paperweights</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Among other responsibilities, the Archives department preserves Microsoft history, be it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/28/1773067.aspx"> old hardware</a>, old software, old documentation, or ephemera. Last year, one of my colleagues was cleaning out his office because he was <a href="http://www.dobleve.org/"> moving to Granada</a>, and of the junk he was going to throw out, the Archives asked me to save the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Windows NT Workstation 3.51 for PowerPC (box and CD) </li>
<li>Windows NT Workstation 3.51 for Alpha AXP (CD only) </li>
<li>Documentation for two internal UI libraries from over a decade ago </li>
<li>Word 97/Excel 97 Service Pack 3 for Alpha AXP </li>

<li>MSN Internet Access promotional booklet and CD (unopened) </li>
<li>An official CD of an internal build of a 1999     user interface project that was later abandoned     (although its spirit survives in Windows XP). </li>
<li>The official CD of pictures from the Windows XP RTM party (unopened) </li>
<li>A lava lamp prize from an internal promotional campaign </li>
</ul>
