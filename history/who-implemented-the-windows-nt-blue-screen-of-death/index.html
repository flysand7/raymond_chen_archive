<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Who implemented the Windows NT blue screen of death?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Following up on the history of the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 blue screen messages, John Vert admits that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-designed-the-original-Windows-Blue-Screen-of-Death">he wrote the Windows NT blue screen of death</a>. In particular, he explains why it was white text on a blue background. (That it happened to match the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 color scheme was a coincidence.) </p>
<p>As I recall, it was John Vert who taught me the basics of Alpha AXP assembly language. (As I noted earlier, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">As Richard Bond taught me the basics of Itanium assembly language</a>.) </p>
