<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You even have to watch out for your placeholder bitmaps</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>During the betas of Windows Vista, the final set of sample logon pictures had yet to be determined, so a bunch of placeholder bitmaps were created. These placeholders consisted of the letters <i>FPO</i> in a box. <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/layout/g/fpo.htm"> FPO is a standard term in desktop publishing</a>; it stands for <i>For Position Only</i>. In order to permit designers to perform page layout before final images are ready, a For Position Only image with the correct size and shape (but dummy contents) is used. I learned it as <a href="http://www.ieee.org/services/promolibrary/faq.html#WhatdoestheFPOthewatermarkontheprintadsmean">For Placement Only</a>, but the meaning is the same.
 We received a bug report from a beta tester in Austria who was surprised to see what appeared at first glance to be the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Freedom_Party"> the FPÖ political party</a> as several of the logon picture options. Was Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/12/17/505062.aspx"> taking sides</a> in the political affairs of Austria? No, it was just a coincidence.</p>
<p> I suspect the designers learned their lesson: Don’t use publishing jargon in bitmaps, even if it seems harmless. </p>
