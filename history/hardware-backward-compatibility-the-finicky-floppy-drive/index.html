<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hardware backward compatibility: The finicky floppy drive</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I think the behavior is more <i>petulant</i> than <i>finicky</i>, but <i>finicky</i> is alliterative.
 Back in the days of Windows 95, I was talking with the person responsible for, among other things, the floppy disk driver, and I learned about a particular driver hack that was needed to work around a flaw in a very common motherboard chipset.</p>
<p> Apparently the floppy disk controller in this chipset was very picky about how you talked to it. If the very first command it receives after power-on is a read request, and there is no disk in the drive, the controller chip hangs unrecoverably. Issuing a reset to the chip has no effect. It’s gone. You have to power-cycle the machine and try again. </p>
