<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why was MoveTo replaced with MoveToEx?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Commenter Ulric asks,
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#619634">Where did MoveTo(HDC, int, int) go?</a>”
</p>
<p>
Back in the 16-bit days, the function to move the current point
was called <code>MoveTo</code>,
and its return value was a <code>DWORD</code> which encoded the
previous position,
packing two 16-bit coordinates into a single 32-bit value.
As part of the transition to 32-bit Windows,
GDI switched to using 32-bit coordinates instead of the
wimpy 16-bit coordinates of old.
As a result, it was no longer possible to encode the original
position in a single <code>DWORD</code>.
Something new had to be developed.
</p>
<p>
That new thing was the <code>MoveToEx</code> function.
Instead of returning a single <code>DWORD</code>,
it accepted a final parameter which
received the previous coordinates.
If you didn’t care about the previous coordinates,
you could just pass <code>NULL</code>.
All of the GDI functions which used to pack two 16-bit coordinates
into a single <code>DWORD</code>
got <code>Ex</code>-ified in this way so they could accommodate
the new 32-bit coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
But why did the old <code>MoveTo</code> function go away?
Why not keep it around for source code compatibility?
</p>
<p>
I find this an interesting question,
since most people seem to think that maintaining source code
compability between the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows
was an idea whose
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/31/363790.aspx">
stupidity</a>
rivals
prosecuting a land war in Asia.
(If we had followed this advice,
people would just be asking,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/08/9182990.aspx#9191060">
why did you replace <code>WinExec</code> with the much harder-to-use
<code>CreateProcess</code></a>?)
By the same logic, source code compatibility between 16-bit and 32-bit
Windows is equally absurd.
According to these people,
porting 16-bit code to
to 32-bit Windows is the <i>best time</i> to introduce
these sorts of incompatibilities,
in order to force people to rewrite their programs.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the reason we lost <code>MoveTo</code> was that there
was no way to return 64 bits of information in a 32-bit integer.
Now it's true that in many cases, the caller doesn't actually care
about the previous position,
but of course the <code>MoveTo</code> function doesn't know that.
It returns a value; it doesn't know whether the caller is going to
use that return value or not.
</p>
<p>
I guess one way out would have been to change the return value of
<code>MoveTo</code> to <code>void</code>.
That way, people who didn't care about the return value would still
compile, while people who did try to use the return value
would get a compile error and have to switch to <code>MoveToEx</code>.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I guess that could've been done,
but you could also have done that yourself:
</p>
<pre>
#define MoveTo(hdc, x, y) ((void)MoveToEx(hdc, x, y, NULL))
</pre>
<p>
I find it interesting that most people who write their own
<code>MoveTo</code> macro don't use the <code>(void)</code> cast.
In most cases, this is a mistake in porting from 16-bit Windows.
(I can tell because the macro is mixed in with a bunch of other
porting macros.)
However, in other cases, it could be intentional.
The authors of the macro may simply not have known about the old
16-bit days and simply expected their macro to be used as if it
were prototyped as
<code>BOOL MoveTo(HDC, int, int)</code>.
</p>
<p>
These people will probably be baffled if they run across any
actual 16-bit Windows code that tried to extract the high word
from the return value of <code>MoveTo</code>.
"Why are you extracting the high word from a <code>BOOL</code>?"
</p>
<p>
<b>Historical exercise</b>:
Instead of adding a new parameter, why not just make
<code>MoveToEx</code> return an <code>__int64</code>?</p>
