<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The sad but short story of the <code>SM_AccessoriesName</code> registry value</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <code>SM_AccessoriesName</code> is another victim of programs that reach into undocumented sections of the registry.</p>
<p>This registry value was never documented since it existed for internal use, and for the 64-bit release of Windows, we finally were able to get rid of it in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Until the application compatibility team found a major program that used it. So back it goes, at least for now, until they can figure out a way to keep that program happy while still removing the value.¹ (Perhaps they may be able to shim it.)</p>
<p>“Why not just break the program and tell the vendor to fix their busted program?”</p>
<p>Easier said than done. The vendor of this particular program happens to be a vicious competitor of Microsoft, who in the past has been known to <a href="/history/that-time-the-ceo-of-a-company-complained-to-congress-about-windows-file-extensions"> complain loudly to anyone who will listen</a> that Microsoft intentionally breaks their programs in order to gain a competitive advantage. Breaking their program would just be inviting another lawsuit. “Microsoft once again wields its monopoly power to punish competitors.”</p>
<p>Such is the life of the application compatibility team.</p>
<p>¹ I just went back and checked, and in Windows 10, the registry value is finally gone. Only took, what, 10 years?</p>
