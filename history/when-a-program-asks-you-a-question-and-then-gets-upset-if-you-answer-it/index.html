<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When a program asks you a question and then gets upset if you answer it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffdav/archive/2004/10/04/237816.aspx"> JeffDav’s story of a program that didn’t like it when he told it where to install</a> reminded me of another program that we dealt with during Windows 95 development.
 This was a big-name program developed by one of the biggest-of-the-big name software companies.  Let’s give this program the imaginary name “LitWare”. Its setup program asked you where you wanted the program to be installed, and it suggested “C:\LITWARE”. If you accepted the default, then everything proceeded normally.
 However, if you changed the default to <strong>anything else</strong>, the setup program ran to completion, but the program itself wouldn’t run.
 Because the program contained the hard-coded path “C:\LITWARE” and insisted that it find its support files in that directory.</p>
<p> At least Jeff’s program realized that it was about to be installed into a directory where it would fail to work! </p>
