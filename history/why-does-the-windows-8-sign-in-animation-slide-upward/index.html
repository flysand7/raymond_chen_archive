<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the Windows 8 sign-in animation slide upward?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The early design for the animation that occurs when you sign in was to take your logon wallpaper and open it up like a curtain.</p>

<p>This worked well for nature photos.</p>
<p>However, it is very common for users to put pictures of <i>people</i> on their logon wallpaper. The likelihood of putting a person on your logon wallpaper is strongly correlated to whether you have children.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>

<p>It turns out that people don’t react well when they see their children’s heads cut in half.</p>
<p>That’s why the sign-in animation is careful not to cut the picture into pieces.</p>
