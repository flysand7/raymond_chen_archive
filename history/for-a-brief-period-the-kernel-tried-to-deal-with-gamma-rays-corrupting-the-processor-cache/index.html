<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">For a brief period, the kernel tried to deal with gamma rays corrupting the processor cache</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>At one point, the following code was added to the part of the kernel that brings the system out of a low-power state: </p>
<pre>
        ;
        ; Invalidate the processor cache so that any stray gamma
        ; rays (I'm serious) that may have flipped cache bits
        ; while in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface">S1</a> will be ignored.
        ;
        ; Honestly.  The processor manufacturer asked for this.
        ; I'm serious.
        ;
         invd
</pre>
<p>I’m not sure what the thinking here is. I mean, if the cache might have been zapped by a stray gamma ray, then couldn’t RAM have been zapped by a stray gamma ray, too? Or is processor cache more susceptible to gamma rays than RAM? The person who wrote the comment seems to share my incredulity. </p>
<p>Less than three weeks later, the <code>INVD</code> instruction was commented out. But the comment block remains. </p>
<p>In case we decide to resume trying to deal with gamma rays corrupting the the processor cache, I guess. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: One of my colleagues wasn’t part of this specific change, but recalled that these sorts of strange-sounding requests were not uncommon, especially for early processor steppings. The workaround was removed once the problem was fixed in microcode or in a later processor stepping. </p>
