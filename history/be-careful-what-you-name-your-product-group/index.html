<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Be careful what you name your product group</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>They thought they were so clever when they named the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/Oct96/re-org.asp"> Desktop Applications Division</a>. “And the abbreviation is ‘DAD’, isn’t that cute? Complements the Microsoft Office Manager toolbar (MOM).”</p>
<p> And then the troubles started. </p>
<p> Shortly after the new product group was formed, everybody in the product group started getting email talking about strange non-business things. How’s the garden doing? Did you get my letter? When will the twins be coming home from college? </p>
<p> The reason is that the email address for sending mail to the entire division was—naturally—”DAD”. But it so happens that many people have a nickname for their father in their address book, named—of course—”dad”. People thought they were sending email to their dad, when in fact it was going to DAD. </p>
<p> The email address for sending mail to the entire division was quickly changed to something like “deskapps” or “dappdiv”. </p>
