<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The SuperH-3, part 7: Bitwise logical operations</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The SH-3 has a rather basic collection of bitwise logical operations.</p>
<pre>    AND Rm, Rn          ; Rn &amp;= Rm
    AND #imm, r0        ; r0 &amp;= unsigned 8-bit immediate

    OR  Rm, Rn          ; Rn |= Rm
    OR  #imm, r0        ; r0 |= unsigned 8-bit immediate

    XOR Rm, Rn          ; Rn ^= Rm
    XOR #imm, r0        ; r0 ^= unsigned 8-bit immediate

    NOT Rm, Rn          ; Rn = ~Rm
</pre>
<p>Nothing fancy. No <i>nor</i> or <i>nand</i> or <i>andnot</i> or other goofy bitwise operations. Just plain vanilla stuff. Do note that the 8-bit immediate is unsigned here.</p>
<p>There is also an instruction for testing bits wthout modifying anything other than the <var>T</var> flag.</p>
<pre>    TST Rm, Rn              ; T = ((Rn &amp; Rm) == 0)
    TST #imm, r0            ; T = ((r0 &amp; signed 8-bit immediate) == 0)
</pre>
<p>The <i>test</i> instruction performs a bitwise <i>and</i> and compares the result with zero. In this case, the 8-bit immediate is signed.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s something goofy after all: Load/modify/store instructions!</p>
<pre>    AND.B #imm, @(r0, GBR)  ; @(r0 + gbr) &amp;= 8-bit immediate
    OR.B  #imm, @(r0, GBR)  ; @(r0 + gbr) |= 8-bit immediate
    XOR.B #imm, @(r0, GBR)  ; @(r0 + gbr) ^= 8-bit immediate
    TST.B #imm, @(r0, GBR)  ; T = ((@(r0 + gbr) &amp; 8-bit immediate) == 0)
</pre>
<p>These <code>.B</code> versions of the bitwise logical operations operate on a byte in memory indexed by the <var>r0</var> and <var>gbr</var> registers. Okay, so <code>TST.B</code> is not a load/modify/store; it’s just a load, but I included it in this group because he wants to be with his friends.</p>
<p>In practice, the Microsoft compiler does not generate these instructions.</p>
<p>Finally, we have this guy, the only truly atomic instruction in the SH-3 instruction set.</p>
<pre>    TAS.B @Rn              ; T = (@Rn == 0), @Rn |= 0x80
</pre>
<p>The <i>test-and-set</i> instruction reads a byte from memory, compares it against zero (setting <var>T</var> accordingly), and then sets the high bit and writes the result back out. This was clearly designed for building low-level synchronization primitives, but I’m not sure anybody actually uses it.</p>
<p>I say that it is the only truly atomic operation because it holds the data bus locked for the duration of its operation. The load/modify/store instructions we saw above do not lock the bus, so it’s possible for a coprocessor to modify the memory out from under the SH-3.</p>
<p>That’s it for the logical operations. <a href="/history/the-superh-3-part-8-bit-shifting"> Next up are the bit shifting operations</a>.</p>
