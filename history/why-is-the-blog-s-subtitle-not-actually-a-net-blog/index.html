<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the blog's subtitle "Not actually a .NET blog"?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Based on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/07/690947.aspx"> the feedback from my last CLR week</a>, I think one CLR week a year is about right, Welcome to CLR Week 2007.
 I’ll kick off the week with something not actually technical, but which might be puzzling to the newcomers: Why is the blog’s subtitle “Not actually a .NET blog”?
 When I started, the blog hosting site for Microsoft technical bloggers was <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/">blogs.gotdotnet.com</a>, and this site was consequently located at <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/oldnewthing/"> blogs.gotdotnet.com/oldnewthing</a>. (The old address still works. Blog backward compatibility, I guess.) It was the .NET folks like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad Abrams</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/">Chris Brumme</a> who started the big wave of Microsoft blogging in 2003, and when they set me up, they set me up with what they had.
 I chose the subtitle, therefore, because the name gotdotnet.com implied that all the blogs would be .NET-related, but mine wasn’t. The blog moved to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/"> weblogs.asp.net</a> and then to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/"> blogs.msdn.com</a>, so the .NET assumption no longer applied, but I kept the tag line anyway.</p>
