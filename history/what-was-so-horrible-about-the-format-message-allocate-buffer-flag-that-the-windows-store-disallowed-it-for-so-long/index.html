<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What was so horrible about the FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER flag that the Windows Store disallowed it for so long?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="/history/what-does-it-mean-when-it-says-that-format-message-allocate-buffer-can-be-used-in-store-apps-starting-in-windows-10" title="What does it mean when it says that FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER can be used in Store apps starting in Windows 10?"> Last time</a>, we learned about the tumultuous history of the <code>FORMAT_</code><code>MESSAGE_</code><code>ALLOCATE_</code><code>BUFFER</code> flag in Windows Store UWP apps.</p>
<p>But why was this flag disallowed for so long?</p>
<p>It’s nothing particularly profound. Rather, it was just bad luck.</p>
<p>The buffer allocated by the <code>FORMAT_</code><code>MESSAGE_</code><code>ALLOCATE_</code><code>BUFFER</code> flag needs to be freed by calling <code>Local­Free</code>, but <code>Local­Free</code> was not one of the functions that can be called from a Windows Store app.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Because <code>Local­Alloc</code> and <code>Local­Free</code> are legacy functions that hang around for backward compatibility with 16-bit Windows. New programs shouldn’t be using them. It’s not like your new program needs to be backward compatible with 16-bit Windows 3.1.</p>
<p>But this left the <code>FORMAT_</code><code>MESSAGE_</code><code>ALLOCATE_</code><code>BUFFER</code> flag in a bit of a pickle, because despite being something new for Win32, the flag continues to use that old and busted legacy function for memory allocation.</p>
<p>There was some discussion within the team about how to address the problem. One school of thought was to document enough of the internals of the <code>Local­Free</code> function so that you could call <code>Heap­Free</code> to free it. You can see remnants of this approach in the comments of the <code>winbase.h</code> header file:</p>
<pre>//
// FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER requires use of HeapFree
//
</pre>
<p>For a while, there was also this paragraph of the <code>FORMAT_</code><code>MESSAGE_</code><code>ALLOCATE_</code><code>BUFFER</code> documentation that says a bunch of stuff in a rather confusing way.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><b>Windows 10</b>: <b>LocalAlloc()</b> has different options: <b>LMEM_FIXED</b>, and <b>LMEM_MOVABLE</b>. <b>FormatMessage()</b> uses <b>LMEM_FIXED</b>, so <b>HeapFree</b> can be used. If <b>LMEM_MOVABLE</b> is used, <b>HeapFree</b> cannot be used.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Fortunately, the confusing paragraph isn’t there any more.)</p>
<p>The decision that won the day was to accept that legacy code will never die. The team just held their nose and added <code>LocalAlloc</code> and <code>LocalFree</code> to the list of functions that are permitted to be called by Windows Store app.</p>
<p>But please, promise to use it only for situations that absolutely require it for compatibility purposes, like freeing the message string allocated by <code>Format­Message</code>. Don’t use it as your go-to memory allocation function.</p>
