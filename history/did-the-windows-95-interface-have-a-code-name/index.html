<p>Commenter kinokijuf wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/06/25/10428357.aspx#10428665"> whether the Windows 95 interface had a code name</a>.
 Nope.
 We called it “the new shell” while it was under preliminary development, and when it got enabled in the builds, we just called it “the shell.”</p>
<p> (Explorer originally was named Cabinet, unrelated to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_%28file_format%29"> the container file format</a> of the same name. This original name lingers in the window class: CabinetWClass.) </p>
