<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the N in nmake stand for?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Visual Studio toolchain comes with a tool called <code>nmake</code>. It processes files in roughly the same way as the traditional Unix <code>make</code> tool. Why is it called <code>nmake</code> instead of just <code>make</code>? </p>
<p>Rewind back to the late 1980’s. The Microsoft languages toolchain¹ included a <code>make</code> program which we will generously describe as <i>vaguely inspired by</i> the Unix <code>make</code> tool: It processed files that looked like Makefiles, but its dependency calculations were nowhere near as sophisticated as the original Unix <code>make</code> program. As a result, you had to play games with the order of evaluation in order to get everything built in the correct order. </p>
<p>This woefully inadequate <code>make</code> program was the source of much dissatisfaction. A developer was selected to reimplement <code>make</code> from the ground up using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">clean room design</a>, working only from the makefile specification without any access to the Unix source code. </p>
<p>To distinguish the new version from the old and busted version, she gave the new version the name <i>New Make</i>, or <code>nmake</code>. </p>
<p>It’s a tribute to the success of the new version that everybody has forgotten that there was an old and busted version to begin with. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: What about <code>MASM</code>? What does the M stand for? </p>
<p>That one’s easier. The M stands for Macro. It’s the Microsoft Macro Assembler. What made it different from plain old <code>ASM</code> was the fact that it supported macros. </p>
<p>¹ The name <i>Visual Studio</i> wouldn’t come onto the scene until a decade later. </p>
