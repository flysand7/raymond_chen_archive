<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The evolution of Windows 8 charms</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s unclear what inspired the name for charms. It may have come from the item of jewelry, or perhaps from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/?keywords=wine charm&amp;tag=tholneth-20">wine glass charms</a> which are used at cocktail parties in certain social circles to identify which wine glass is yours. </p>
<p>Whatever the origin, the charms feature quickly gained the internal nickname <a href="http://www.luckycharms.com/">Lucky Charms</a> from the breakfast cereal. </p>
<p>I’m going to skip the prehistory of charms and just look at the evolution of the charm set. </p>
<p>Early design explorations came up with a list of <a href="http://fourlights.ytmnd.com/"><i>seven</i> charms</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Play To</li>
<li>Print</li>
<li>Pin</li>
<li>Stash (I think this was sort of like a clipboard)</li>
<li>Lookup (I don’t know how this was different from Search)</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few more design iterations, the list of charms evolved to </p>
<ul>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Switch</li>
<li>Start</li>
<li>Devices</li>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>Language</li>
</ul>
<p>(There’s a long story behind the Switch charm, which I will have to tell some other time.) </p>
<p>Each charm opened a <i>blossom</i>, which was a radial menu that opened up <i>around</i> the charm. This blossom idea didn’t last long. </p>
<p>Eventually, the designers settled on these charms: </p>
<ul>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Send To</li>
<li>Start</li>
<li>Connect</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re very close to what shipped in Windows 8. Just two more tweaks. </p>
<p>The first tweak is that the <i>Connect</i> charm was renamed <i>Devices</i>. </p>
<p>The second tweak is that the <i>Send To</i> charm was removed. The story behind this is a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>As originally envisioned, the <i>Share</i> charm was for <i>social sharing</i>: emailing a Web page to your friend, posting to your Facebook page, that sort of thing. On the other hand, the <i>Send To</i> charm was for <i>sending data to another application</i>, like adding an item to a to-do list. </p>
<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-657T">During the summer</a>, we discovered that when our interns wanted an application to receive data from another application, it was pretty much a toss-up whether they registered the application as a <i>Share</i> target or a <i>Send To</i> target. </p>
<p>What this told us that segregating the two types of data sharing was interesting in a theoretical sense, but in practice, people didn’t really make a distinction between the two. A last-minute design change was made to merge the <i>Share</i> and <i>Send To</i> charms into a single <i>Share</i> charm, and made it cover both social sharing and application sharing. </p>
<p>A happy side-effect of this reduction was that the number of charms was an odd number, allowing the Start charm to be placed in the center. </p>
