<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Fact check: The first major Microsoft product launched via Webcast</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In 2009, while hosting the Webcast launch of Office Communications Server 2007 R2 (what a mouthful; no wonder they renamed it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/lync/default.aspx"> Lync</a>), <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/161088.asp"> Stephen Elop claimed that this was the first time Microsoft had launched a major product via Webcast</a>.
 Elop’s crack team of marketing researchers apparently forgot about <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/stbnewsbytes/archive/2008/11/11/microsoft-to-launch-small-business-server-2008-and-essential-business-server-2008-tomorrow-via-live-webcast.aspx"> the Webcast launch</a>, just three months earlier, of Windows Small Business Server 2008.
 Maybe somebody can find an even earlier Webcast launch of a major Microsoft product.</p>
<p> (Perhaps Elop is claiming that Small Business Server is not a major product, but by that standard, neither is Office Communications Server, which is arguably even more of a niche product than SBS.) </p>
