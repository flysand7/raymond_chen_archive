<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Even if a function doesn’t do anything, you still have to call it if the documentation says so, because it might do something tomorrow</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If the documentation says that you have to call a function, then you have to call it. It may be that the function doesn’t do anything, but that doesn’t prevent it from doing something in the future.</p>
<p> Today’s example is the function <code>GetEnvironmentStrings</code>, which returns you all the environment variables of the current process in a single block, which you can then study at your leisure. When you’re finished, you’re supposed to call <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code>. That’s what the documentation says, and if you did that, then you’re in good shape. </p>
<p> However, some people noticed that on Windows NT 4, the Unicode version of the <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code> function didn’t do anything. In other words, the Unicode environment block didn’t need to be freed. When you called <code>GetEnvironmentStrings</code>, the kernel just returned you a raw pointer to the <i>real live</i> environment strings (which, since this is Windows NT, are kept in Unicode internally). Since nothing was allocated, there was nothing to free. </p>
<p> The problem with this technique was that if somebody called <code>SetEnvironmentVariable</code> in the meantime, the environment block changed out from under the caller of <code>GetEnvironmentStrings</code>. </p>
<p> Oops. </p>
<p> To fix this, the <code>GetEnvironmentStrings</code> function was changed to return a copy of the environment block <i>even if you call the Unicode version</i>. The corresponding Unicode <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code> function frees that environment copy. </p>
<p> Programs that followed the specification and called <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code> (even though it didn’t do anything up until now) were in good shape. Their call to <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code> now frees the memory, and all is right with the world. </p>
<p> Programs that coded to the implementation rather than the specification are now in a world of hurt. If they simply skipped the “useless” call to <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code>, they will now find themselves leaking memory. On the other hand, if they gave lip service to <code>FreeEnvironmentStrings</code> by calling it, but using the memory anyway, they will find themselves accessing invalid heap memory, and all sorts of havoc can ensue. </p>
<p> There’s sometimes a reason for the rules that seem stupid at first glance. (“Call this function that doesn’t do anything.”) Changes to the implementation may make them less stupid in the future. </p>
