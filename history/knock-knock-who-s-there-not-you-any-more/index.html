<p>One of my many favorite Dilbert cartoons is also one of the earlier ones. It’s <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/news_and_history/html/working_in_dilberts_world.html"> the first strip reprinted in this article</a>.
 It may not actually have happened, but I was told that that one project many years ago replaced its lead manager. While noteworthy, this sort of thing happens often enough that people take it in stride. What put it into a higher category, however, was that the email that announced this change at the top was sent while the outgoing manager was out of the country on vacation.
 One can imagine the now-former manager’s surprise upon returning to the office.
 “Dum di dum, catching up on email, hey what the…”</p>
<p> Now, the outgoing manager may very well have known about this change before heading out on vacation, but the story is funnier (and I therefore like to believe) that it was a surprise. </p>
