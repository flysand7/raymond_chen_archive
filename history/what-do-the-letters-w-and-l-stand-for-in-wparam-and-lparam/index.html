<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What do the letters W and L stand for in WPARAM and LPARAM?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Once upon a time, Windows was 16-bit. Each message could carry with it two pieces of data, called <code>WPARAM</code> and <code>LPARAM</code>. The first one was a 16-bit value (“word”), so it was called W. The second one was a 32-bit value (“long”), so it was called L.</p>
<p>You used the W parameter to pass things like handles and integers. You used the L parameter to pass pointers.</p>
<p>When Windows was converted to 32-bit, the <code>WPARAM</code> parameter grew to a 32-bit value as well. So even though the “W” stands for “word”, it isn’t a word any more. (And in 64-bit Windows, both parameters are 64-bit values!)</p>
<p>It is helpful to understand the origin of the terms. If you look at the design of window messages, you will see that if the message takes a pointer, the pointer is usually passed in the <code>LPARAM</code>, whereas if the message takes a handle or an integer, then it is passed in the <code>WPARAM</code>. (And if a message takes both, the integer goes in the <code>WPARAM</code> and the pointer goes in the <code>LPARAM</code>.)</p>
<p>Once you learn this, it makes remembering the parameters for window messages a little easier. Conversely, if a message breaks this rule, then it sort of makes your brain say, “No, that’s not right.”</p>
