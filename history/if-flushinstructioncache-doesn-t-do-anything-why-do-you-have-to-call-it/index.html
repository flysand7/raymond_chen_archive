<p> If you look at the implementation of FlushInstructionCache on Windows 95, you’ll see that it’s just a return instruction. It doesn’t actually do anything. So why do you have to call it? </p>
<p> Because the act of calling it is the whole point. The control transfers implicit in calling a function suffice to flush the instruction cache on a Pentium. The function doesn’t have to do anything else; it is fact that you called a function that is important. </p>
