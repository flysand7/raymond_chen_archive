<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are HANDLE return values so inconsistent?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
If you look at the various functions that return <code>HANDLE</code>s,
you’ll see that some of them return <code>NULL</code>
(like <code>CreateThread</code>)
and some of them return <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code>
(like <code>CreateFile</code>).
You have to check the documentation to see what each particular function
returns on failure.</p>
<p>
Why are the return values so inconsistent?</p>
<p>
The reasons, as you may suspect, are historical.</p>
<p>
The values were chosen to be compatible with 16-bit Windows.
The 16-bit functions <code>OpenFile</code>, <code>_lopen</code> and
<code>_lcreat</code> return <code>-1</code> on failure, so the 32-bit
<code>CreateFile</code> function returns <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code>
in order to facilitate porting code from Win16.</p>
<p>
(Armed with this, you can now answer the following trivia
question: Why do I call <code>CreateFile</code>
when I’m not actually creating a file?  Shouldn’t it be called
<code>OpenFile</code>?  Answer:  Yes, <code>OpenFile</code> would have
been a better name, but
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/fileio/base/openfile.asp">
that name was already taken</a>.)</p>
<p>
On the other hand, there are no Win16 equivalents for
<code>CreateThread</code> or <code>CreateMutex</code>, so they
return <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>
Since the precedent had now been set for inconsistent return values,
whenever a new function got added, it was a bit of a toss-up whether
the new function returned <code>NULL</code> or
<code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code>.</p>
<p>
This inconsistency has multiple consequences.</p>
<p>
First, of course, you have to be careful to check the return values
properly.</p>
<p>
Second, it means that if you write a generic handle-wrapping class,
you have to be mindful of two possible “not a handle” values.</p>
<p>
Third, if you want to pre-initialize a <code>HANDLE</code> variable,
you have to initialize it in a manner compatible with the function
you intend to use.  For example, the following code is wrong:</p>
<pre>
HANDLE h = NULL;
if (UseLogFile()) {
    h = CreateFile(...);
}
DoOtherStuff();
if (h) {
   Log(h);
}
DoOtherStuff();
if (h) {
    CloseHandle(h);
}
</pre>
<p>This code has two bugs.  First, the return value from
<code>CreateFile</code> is checked incorrectly.  The code above
checks for <code>NULL</code> instead of <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code>.
Second, the code initializes the <code>h</code> variable incorrectly.
Here’s the corrected version:</p>
<pre>
HANDLE h = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
if (UseLogFile()) {
    h = CreateFile(...);
}
DoOtherStuff();
if (h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
   Log(h);
}
DoOtherStuff();
if (h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
    CloseHandle(h);
}
</pre>
<p>
Fourth, you have to be particularly careful with the
<code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code> value:
By coincidence, the value <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code>
happens to be numerically equal to the pseudohandle returned by
<code>GetCurrentProcess()</code>.
Many kernel functions accept pseudohandles, so if
if you mess up
and accidentally call, say, <code>WaitForSingleObject</code> on a
failed <code>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE</code> handle, you will actually
end up waiting on your own process.  This wait will, of course,
never complete, because a process is signalled when it exits,
so you ended up waiting for yourself.</p>
