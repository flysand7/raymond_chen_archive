<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How were window hooks implemented in 16-bit Windows?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The mechanism for keeping track of window hooks was very
different in 16-bit Windows.
The functions involved were <code>SetWindowsHook</code>,
<code>UnhookWindowsHook</code>
and <code>DefHookProc</code>.
The first two functions still exist today, but the third one has
been replaced with a macro:
</p>
<pre>
// 16-bit prototype
DWORD WINAPI DefHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam,
                         LPARAM lParam, HHOOK FAR *phk);
// 32-bit macro
#define DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, phhk)\
        CallNextHookEx(*phhk, nCode, wParam, lParam)
</pre>
<p>
Disclaimer: All code below is “reconstructed from memory”.
The spirit of the code is intact, but the precise details
may be off.
</p>
<p>
To install a windows hook in 16-bit Windows, you started by
calling <code>SetWindowsHook</code>:
</p>
<pre>
HHOOK g_hhkPrev;
g_hhkPrev = SetWindowsHook(WH_WHATEVER, MyHookProc);
</pre>
<p>
The return value from <code>SetWindowsHook</code> must be saved
in a global variable, which we gave the somewhat provocative
name <code>g_hhkPrev</code>.
The hook procedure itself went something like this:
</p>
<pre>
// In Win16, hook procedures returned a DWORD, not an LRESULT.
DWORD CALLBACK MyHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
  if (nCode &gt;= 0) { ... }
  return DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, &amp;g_hhkPrev);
}
</pre>
<p>
And then when you were finished, you removed the hook by
calling <code>UnhookWindowsHook</code>:
</p>
<pre>
UnhookWindowsHook(WH_WHATEVER, MyhookProc);
g_hhkPrev = NULL;
</pre>
<p>
Internally, the chain of hook functions was managed as
a linked list, but instead of using some internal data structure
to keep track of the hooks, the linked list was managed
<strong>inside the HHOOK variables themselves</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The internal implementation of <code>SetWindowsHook</code>
was simply this:
</p>
<pre>
// This array is initialized with a bunch
// of "do nothing" hook procedures.
HOOKPROC g_rgHook[NUMHOOKS];
HHOOK WINAPI SetWindowsHook(int nType, HOOKPROC pfnHookProc)
{
 HHOOK hhkPrev = (HHOOK)g_rgHook[nType];
 g_rgHook[nType] = pfnHookProc;
 return hhkPrev;
}
</pre>
<p>
Installing a hook merely set your hook procedure as the head of
the hook chain, and it returned the previous head.
Invoking a hook was a simple matter of calling the hook at the
head of the chain:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD CallHook(int nType, int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 return g_rgHook[nType](nCode, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
Each hook procedure did its work and then sent the call
down the hook chain by calling <code>DefHookProc</code>,
passing the <code>HHOOK</code> <strong>by address</strong>.
</p>
<pre>
DWORD WINAPI DefHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam,
                         LPARAM lParam, HHOOK FAR *phk)
{
 HOOKPROC pfnNext = (HOOKPROC)*phk;
 if (nCode &gt;=0) {
  return pfnNext(nCode, wParam, lParam);
 }
 ... more to come ...
}
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, it’s all blindingly simple:
Invoking a hook calls the first hook procedure,
which then calls <code>DefHookProc</code>, which
knows that a <code>HHOOK</code>
is just a <code>HOOKPROC</code>, and it forwards the call down
the chain by merely calling the next hook procedure directly.
</p>
<p>
The real magic happens when somebody wants to unhook.
Recall that the rule for hook procedures is that a negative
hook code should be passed straight to <code>DefHookProc</code>
(or in modern times, <code>CallNextHookEx</code>).
This convention allows the hook system to use negative codes
to manage its own internal bookkeeping.
In this case, we’re using <code>-1</code> as the
“unhook this hook procedure” code.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL WINAPI UnhookWindowsHook(int nType, HOOKPROC pfnHookProc)
{
 return DefHookProc(-1, 0, (LPARAM)pfnHookProc,
                    (HHOOK FAR*)&amp;g_rgHook[nType]);
}
</pre>
<p>And then the real magic begins:
</p>
<pre>
DWORD WINAPI DefHookProc(int nCode, WPARAM wParam,
                         LPARAM lParam, HHOOK FAR *phk)
{
 HOOKPROC pfnNext = (HOOKPROC)*phk;
 if (nCode &gt;=0) {
  return pfnNext(nCode, wParam, lParam);
 }
 switch (nCode) {
 case -1: // trying to unhook a node
  if (pfnNext == (HOOKPROC)lParam) { // found it
   *phk = (HHOOK)pfnNext(-2, 0, 0);
   return TRUE;
  }
  // else keep looking
  return pfnNext(nCode, wParam, lParam);
 case -2: // report the next hook procedure
   return (DWORD)*phk;
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
And there you have it, the entire window hook system in
two dozen lines of code.
You have to give 16-bit Windows credit for being small.
</p>
<p>
Let’s walk through hook installation, dispatch, and removal to see
how this all works.
Suppose there is one <code>WH_KEYBOARD</code> hook in the system.
Our variables are therefore set up like this:
</p>
<pre>
// In USER
g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD] = Hook1;
// In HOOK1.DLL
HHOOK g_hhkPrev1 = DoNothingHookProc;
DWORD CALLBACK Hook1(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 if (nCode &gt;= 0) { ... work ... }
 return DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, &amp;g_hhkPrev1);
}
</pre>
<p>
Now suppose you want to install a new hook, <code>Hook2</code>.</p>
<pre>
// In HOOK2.DLL
HHOOK g_hhkPrev2;
g_hhkPrev = SetWindowsHook(WH_KEYBOARD, Hook2);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>SetWindowsHook</code> function just puts your function
in as the new “head” hook function and returns the old one.
</p>
<pre>
// In USER
g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD] = Hook2;
// In HOOK2.DLL
HHOOK g_hhkPrev2 = Hook1;
DWORD CALLBACK Hook2(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 if (nCode &gt;= 0) { ... work ... }
 return DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, &amp;g_hhkPrev2);
}
// In HOOK1.DLL
HHOOK g_hhkPrev1 = DoNothingHookProc;
DWORD CALLBACK Hook1(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 if (nCode &gt;= 0) { ... work ... }
 return DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, &amp;g_hhkPrev1);
}
</pre>
<p>
Now suppose the window manager decides it’s time to fire the
<code>WH_KEYBOARD</code> hook.
It starts with <code>CallHook</code> which calls
<code>g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD]</code> that takes us to
<code>Hook2</code>.
That hook function does its work, then calls
<code>DefHookProc(..., &amp;g_hhkPrev2)</code>,
which dispatches the hook to <code>g_hhkPrev2 == Hook1</code>.
Similarly, the hook travels through <code>Hook1</code>,
then
<code>DefHookProc(..., &amp;g_hhkPrev1)</code>,
where it finally reaches the <code>DoNothingHookProc</code>
which does nothing and ends the hook chain.
</p>
<p>
Now suppose that <code>HOOK1.DLL</code> decides to uninstall its
hook. It therefore calls
<code>UnhookWindowsHook(WH_KEYBOARD, Hook1)</code>.
This starts off the hook chain with the internal hook code <code>-1</code>
and <code>&amp;g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD]</code> as the first hook pointer.
This activates the <code>case -1</code> in <code>DefHookProc</code> code
path, which dereferences its <code>phk</code> parameter and obtains
<code>g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD] == Hook2</code>.
Since this is not equal to <code>Hook1</code>, the call forwards down
the chain to <code>Hook2</code>.
</p>
<p>
Like a good hook function, <code>Hook2</code> reacts to the negative
hook code by handing the call directly to
<code>DefHookProc(-1, ..., &amp;g_hhkPrev2)</code>.
This time, <code>*phk == g_hhkPrev2 == Hook1</code>,
so the test succeeds and we dispatch the hook down the chain
with a new internal code of <code>-2</code>, which means,
“Tell me what the next hook procedure is”.
</p>
<p>
This dispatch calls <code>Hook1</code> which (since the notification
code is negative) immediately passes the call to
<code>DefHookProc(-2, ..., &amp;g_hhkPrev1)</code>.
This now triggers the <code>case -2</code> code path, which
just returns <code>*phk == g_hhkPrev1 == DoNothingHookProc</code>.
This value is returned to the <code>DefHookProc(-1, ...)</code>
which stores the result into <code>*phk == g_hhkPrev2</code>;
the result is that you have <code>g_hhkPrev2 = DoNothingHookProc</code>.
Finally, <code>DefHookProc</code> returns <code>TRUE</code>
to indicate that the hook was successfully uninstalled.
This value is then returned out from all the nested function calls
to the original caller of <code>UnhookWindowsHook</code>.
</p>
<p>
Observe that at the end of this unhook exercise, we get the desired
result:
</p>
<pre>
// In USER
g_rgHook[WH_KEYBOARD] = Hook2; // unchanged
// In HOOK2.DLL
g_hhkPrev2 = DoNothingHookProc; // updated!
DWORD CALLBACK Hook2(int nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 if (nCode &gt;= 0) { ... work ... }
 return DefHookProc(nCode, wParam, lParam, &amp;g_hhkPrev2);
}
</pre>
<p>
And <code>Hook1</code> is out of the hook chain, as we desired.
</p>
<p>
This really isn’t all that complicated.
All we did was delete a node from a linked list.
It’s just that this particular linked list cannot be traversed
by just dereferencing pointers.
Instead, we have to issue a function call and ask the
recursive function to perform the work on the “next” node for us.
That’s what the negative <code>nCode</code> values are for.
</p>
<p>
Every time I work through this exercise,
I am impressed by how compactly 16-bit Windows was written.
In just two dozen lines of code, we managed a linked list of
function calls, including a dispatching system as well as
arbitrary deletion from the middle
of the linked list, and all without any memory allocation.
</p>
<p>
(And because I know people are going to try to change the topic:
Remember, I’m talking about 16-bit Windows, not 32-bit window hooks.)
</p>
<p>
Next time, we’ll look at one way people abused this simple system.</p>
