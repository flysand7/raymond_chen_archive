<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the function WSASetLastError exist?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Why does the function <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/wsasetlasterror_2.asp"> <code>WSASetLastError</code></a> exist when there is already the perfectly good function <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/debug/base/setlasterror.asp"> <code>SetLastError</code></a>?</p>
<p> Actually, you know the answer too, if you sit down and think about it. </p>
<p> Winsock was originally developed to run on both 16-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows. Notice how the classic Winsock functions are based on window messages for asynchronous notifications. In the 16-bit world, there was no <code>SetLastError</code> function. Therefore, Winsock had to provide its own version for the 16-bit implementation. And since source code compatibility is important, there was a 32-bit version as well. Of course, the 32-bit version looks kind of stupid in retrospect if you aren’t aware of the 16-bit version. </p>
