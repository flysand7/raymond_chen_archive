<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is Windows Error Reporting nicknamed “Dr. Watson”?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The nickname for the feature known as Windows Error Reporting is “Dr. Watson”. Where did that name come from?</p>
<p> As you have probably guessed, The name Dr. Watson was inspired by <a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~exlibris/watson.html"> the character of Dr. Watson</a>, the assistant to <a href="http://www.sherlock-holmes.co.uk/"> Sherlock Holmes</a> in the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. </p>
<p> It is my understanding that the doctor was originally developed as part of Windows 3.0 beta testing. His job was to record data about application crashes to a file, so that the file could be uploaded and included with bug reports. The icon was (and continues to be) a friendly doctor using his stethoscope to investigate a problem. </p>
<p> The Doctor has remained true to the “capture information about an error” aspect of his job. In the meantime, the word “Watson” has expanded its meaning to encompass <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikekelly/archive/2005/02/03/366861.aspx"> anonymous end-user feedback mechanisms in general, such as “Content Watson”</a>. (But if you hear “Watson” by itself, the speaker is almost certainly talking about error reporting.) </p>
