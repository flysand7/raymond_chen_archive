<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The ARM processor (Thumb-2), part 7: Bitwise operations</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The ARM processor offers the following bitwise operations:</p>
<pre>    ; bitwise and
    and     Rd, Rn, op2         ; Rd = Rn &amp; op2

    ; bitwise or
    orr     Rd, Rn, op2         ; Rd = Rn | op2

    ; bitwise exclusive or
    eor     Rd, Rn, op2         ; Rd = Rn ^ op2

    ; bitwise not
    mvn     Rd, op2             ; Rd = ~op2

    ; bitwise and not ("bit clear")
    bic     Rd, Rn, op2         ; Rd = Rn &amp; ~op2

    ; bitwise or not
    orn     Rd, Rn, op2         ; Rd = Rn | ~op2

    ; all support the S suffix
</pre>
<p>For bit-testing purposes, there are also discarding versions:</p>
<pre>    ; test for equivalence
    teq     Rn, op2             ; set flags for Rn ^ op2

    ; test
    tst     Rn, op2             ; set flags for Rn &amp; op2
</pre>
<p>For bitwise operations that set flags, the negative (N) and zero (Z) flags reflect the result, the carry (C) flag reflects any shifting that occurred during the calculation of <code>op2</code> (noting that calculating constants may also involve shifting, as noted earlier when we discussed constants), and the overflow (V) flag is unchanged.</p>
<p>I don’t see much value in the <code>TEQ</code> instruction. It sets the Z flag the same way as the the <code>CMP</code> instruction. I guess you could use it to see if two registers have the same sign bit, since it sets N based on the exclusive-or of the two inputs. I guess that’s handy when calculating the sign of emulated multiplication or division, but even in those cases, you aren’t going to jump based on the sign; you’re going to save the sign of the result for later application, so you would be better off with the <code>EOR</code> instruction anyway.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you can use the <code>LSL</code> shift on the second register argument in order to compare the high bit of one register with an arbitrary bit of another.</p>
<pre>    teq     Rn, Rm LSL #n       ; compare Rn bit 31
                                ; and Rm bit 31 - n
    bmi     same                ; branch if different
</pre>
<p>Still not particularly compelling. Maybe there’s some specialized workflow where this is useful, like cryptography?</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll look at the bit shifting instructions.</p>
