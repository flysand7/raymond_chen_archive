<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When was the WM_COPYDATA message introduced, and was it ported downlevel?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Gabe wondered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/10/19/10360980.aspx#10361251"> when the <code>WM_COPY­DATA</code> message was introduced</a>.
 The <code>WM_COPY­DATA</code> message was introduced by Win32. It did not exist in 16-bit Windows.
 But it was there all along.
 The The <code>WM_COPY­DATA</code> message was carefully designed so that it worked in 16-bit Windows automatically. In other words, you retained your source code compatibility between 16-bit and 32-bit Windows without having to do a single thing. Phew, one fewer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/13/10348876.aspx"> breaking change between 16-bit and 32-bit Windows</a>.
 As Neil noted, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/10/19/10360980.aspx#10361367"> there’s nothing stopping you from sending message <code>0x004A</code> in 16-bit Windows with a window handle in the <code>wParam</code> and a pointer to a <code>COPY­DATA­STRUCT</code> in the <code>lParam</code></a>. Since all 16-bit applications ran in the same address space, the null marshaller successfully marshals the data between the two processes.</p>
<p> In a sense, support for the <code>WM_COPY­DATA</code> message was ported downlevel even before the message existed! </p>
