<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The early days of the Microsoft cafeterias</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A tour of Redmond campus cafeterias back in the old days took much less time than <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/21/5021766.aspx"> it would require nowadays</a>. Back then, the cafeterias were tiny affairs, the size of maybe three offices not counting the prep area, with a seating capacity of maybe a dozen tables. Each cafeteria had a theme, so going to lunch back in the day was not “Let’s go to the nearby mega-cafeteria and decide what we’ll have.” It was “Let’s decide what we’ll have, and then go to the mini-cafeteria that is serving it.”
 Here are the cafeterias on campus back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_%28Star_Trek%29"> The Before Time</a>, along with their specialties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building 1: <i>Lite Bite</i>.     Low-calorie and vegetarian food. </li>
<li>Building 4: <i>Wild Pizza</i>.     Pizza, a hot entree, and sandwiches made to order. </li>
<li>Building 5: <i>Burger Bar</i>.     The grill, and home of the famous Blibbet Burger. </li>
<li>Building 8: <i>American Fare</i>.     Traditional American food for the meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. </li>
<li>Building 9: <i>International Cuisine</i>.     A different featured country every week. </li>
<li>Building 10: <i>American Fare</i>.     Traditional American food for the meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. </li>
</ul>
<p> All cafeterias had a salad bar, and the cafeterias in buildings 8 through 10 were <i>extra large</i>: In addition to the featured theme, they also had a grill and made sandwiches to order. (It was like three cafeterias in one!)</p>
<p> I myself have never even seen a Blibbet Burger, much less eaten one. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx"> Larry Osterman has some Blibbet memories</a>, and <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2006/05/microsoft_dinin.html"> Adam Barr has more cafeteria memories</a>. </p>
