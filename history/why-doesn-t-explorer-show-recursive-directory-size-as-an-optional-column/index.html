<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn't Explorer show recursive directory size as an optional column?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/28/336219.aspx#345978">Why start up another program to see folder sizes, when they should just be right there, in Explorer, all the time?</a>”
 The same reason <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/11/350628.aspx"> \\ does not autocomplete to all the computers on the network</a>: Because it would destroy corporate networks.
 Showing folder sizes “all the time” means that when you open, say, the root of a large server, Explorer would start running around recursively enumerating every single directory on the server in order to compute the folder sizes.  One person doing this to a server is bad enough. Imagine if hundreds of people did it simultaneously: The server would be hammered continously.
 Even worse: imagine doing this across a limited-bandwidth link like a VPN or an overseas link. The link would be saturated with file enumerations and wouldn’t have any bandwidth remaining for “real work”. Even the change-notifications that Explorer registers are <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=330929"> cause for much hair-pulling on corporate networks</a>. (And these are change-notifications, which are passive.)
 Even on a home computer, computing folder sizes automatically is is still not a good idea. How would you like it if opening a folder caused Explorer to start churning your disk computing all the folder sizes recursively? (Then again, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/02/26/folder-size-for-windows-explorer.aspx"> maybe you don’t mind, in which case, go nuts</a>.)</p>
<p> (Of course, the question sidesteps the question the linked article tries to address, namely, “What do you mean by the size of a directory anyway?”) </p>
