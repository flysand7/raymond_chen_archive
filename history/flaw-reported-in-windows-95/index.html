<p>One of my colleagues ran across this old news clipping from 20 years ago today. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p><b>Flaw reported in Windows 95</b> </p>
<p><font size="-1">THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</font> </p>
<p>SAN MATEO, Calif. — Microsoft Corp.’s long-awaited Windows 95 operating system has a flaw that can freeze up computers when running certain applications, InfoWorld magazine said Friday. </p>
<p>The company is aware of the problem but is shipping 450,000 anyway as part of a preview program, the magazine said. </p>
<p>“I fear that unless Microsoft goes back to the drawing board on this operating system, only light users will get anything out of it,” said Nicholas Petreley, the magazine’s executive editor. </p>
<p>He said the system’s inability to handle several types of sophisticated applications at the same time made it questionable for business use. </p>

<p>I can’t find a copy of the original InfoWorld article online; all I can find are citations to it, like <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-27/business/fi-47599_1_personal-computer-operating-system">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/business/company-news-flaw-is-pointed-out-early-in-windows-95-software.html">this one</a>. </p>
<p>The clipping had a handwritten note attached: </p>

<p>The report was shortly followed by <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Press+Coverage+of+Windows+95+Bug+is+Overblown%3a+Microsoft+Made+Two...-a016735010">a rebuttal from Windows Magazine</a>, pointing out that this was a beta release, it is not unusual that an unfinished product has bugs, and that a similar bug in an earlier beta was fixed within two weeks. </p>
<p>ZOMG! A beta product has a bug! </p>
<p>I found it cute that my colleague’s mother chose to bring this article to her son’s attention. </p>
