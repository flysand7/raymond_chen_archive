<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Stephen Tolouse's reminiscences of Windows 95 RTM day</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> <a href="http://www.stepto.com/">Stephen Tolouse</a> (known around Microsoft as “stepto”, pronounced “step-toe”) from the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/"> Microsoft Security Response Center</a> reminisces about <a href="http://www.stepto.com/default/log/displaylog1.aspx?ID=127"> Windows 95 RTM</a>. </p>
<p> Stephen mentions that “the build numbers were artificially inflated to reach 950”. There’s actually a technical reason for this inflation, which I intend to write about when I have the time to give the topic the treatment it deserves. </p>
