<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Intel 80386, part 9: Stack frame instructions</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There are a pair of specialized instructions for creating and tearing down stack frames. </p>
<pre>
    ENTER   i16, 0      ; push ebp
                        ; mov ebp, esp
                        ; sub esp, (uint16_t)i16
</pre>
<p>The <code>ENTER</code> instruction sets up a stack frame for a new subroutine. It combines three instructions into one, so that what used to be encoded in eight bytes (1 + 2 + 5) is now encoded in four. However, even on the 80386, the combination instruction executes more slowly than the three component instructions, so this was always a size optimization, not a speed optimization. </p>
<pre>
    LEAVE               ; mov esp, ebp
                        ; pop ebp
</pre>
<p>The <code>LEAVE</code> instruction tears down the stack frame by reversing the effects of the <code>ENTER</code> instruction. This is a one-byte instruction that replaces two instructions that together require three bytes (2 + 1), so it is a size optimization. But it also executes faster than the two instructions it replaces, so it is also a speed optimization. </p>
<p>Modern compilers avoid the <code>ENTER</code> instruction but keep the <code>LEAVE</code> instruction. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: What’s with the second operand of the <code>ENTER</code> instruction? </p>
<p>In C code, the second operand is always zero because C doesn’t support lexically-nested procedures with inherited stack frames. So in practice, you will always see zero as the second parameter. </p>
<p>The second parameter can go up to 15, and it represents the number of additional values pushed onto the stack after pushing <var>ebp</var>. </p>
<pre>
    ENTER   i16, n      ; push ebp
                        ;<span style="border: solid 1px black;border-bottom: none"> sub ebp, 4 </span> ⎱ <span>n times</span>
                        ;<span style="border: solid 1px black;border-top: none"> push [ebp] </span> ⎰
                        ; mov ebp, esp
                        ; sub esp, (uint16_t)i16
</pre>
<p>This means that the <code>ENTER</code> instruction can read as many as fifteen 32-bit values from memory and can write as many as sixteen 32-bit values to memory. That’s a lot of memory access for a single instruction. </p>
