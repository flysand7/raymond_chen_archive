<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Windows 95 crashes a cash register</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Not everything related to the Windows 95 launch went well. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a local CompUSA store found that their cash registers crashed at midnight, forcing eager customers to wait ninety minutes before the problem could be resolved. The cause: A bug in the cash register software which had lain undiscovered because the store had never stayed open past midnight before!</p>
<p> And there was the <a href="http://www.click.com.au/click/aug95/noise/entertainment/"> the launch of Mindows 95 in Hong Kong</a>. </p>
<p> Not one to sit by and miss out on all the attention, Apple responded with its <a href="http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~abe/pictures/windoof/whymac.png"> absolutely brilliant counter-advertisement</a>. </p>
