<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the “Ae” stand for in AeDebug?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The name of the registry key for configuring automatic debugging of application crashes is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Debug/configuring-automatic-debugging">AeDebug</a>. Okay, so it’s obvious what “Debug” stands for, but what does “Ae” stand for? </p>
<p>I can’t prove it, but circumstantial evidence points to AE standing for “Application Error”. The title of the dialog box was originally “Application Error”. And there’s this comment: </p>
<pre>
// This fixes the AE (application error) in component XYZ
</pre>
<p>This evidence lines up with 16-bit Windows, where application crashes were originally called Unrecoverable Application Errors, or UAEs. </p>
<p>So that’s what I’m going to say. It stands for Application Error. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: The procedure¹ in 16-bit Windows that displayed the Unrecoverable Application Error dialog was named <code>Display_Box_of_Doom</code> and it has the understated comment “Display the Unrecoverable Application Error box that everyone seems to dislike so much.” Later, the name of the dialog changed to simply “Application Error”: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150717-00/?p=90881">We gave you a way to try to recover from it</a>, so it wasn’t “unrecoverable” any more. </p>
<p>¹ Note that I called it a “procedure” rather than a “function”. That’s because it, like most of the 16-bit kernel, was written in assembly language. </p>
