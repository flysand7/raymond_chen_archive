<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">I thought you said people don't know how to read analog clocks</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         I had mentioned in passing in <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/commentview.aspx/ae6637d9-58ca-496f-bd2e-732567726906">a         comment on 10/10/2003 10:07PM</a> that one of the reasons the clock on the taskbar         isn’t analog is that some disturbingly high percentage of people (30%? 40%? I forget         exactly) do not know how to read an analog clock.      </p>
<p>         Yet there is is in the Longhorn sidebar. What gives?      </p>
<p>         Ah but if you look more closely, the digital time is printed immediately below it.      </p>
<p>     That was our compromise. </p>
