<p>Only four of the bits in the status register are available to user-mode:</p>

<p>(There was no official meaning for the names of the registers, so I made up mnemonics for them.)</p>
<p>Aside from the flags used by special-purpose instructions (multiplication and division), there is basically only one flag: <var>T</var>. Each instructions decides how it wishes to consume and produce the <var>T</var> flag.</p>
<pre>    CLRT        ; T = 0
    SETT        ; T = 1

    CLRS        ; S = 0
    SETS        ; S = 1
</pre>
<p>There are four instructions which directly set or clear two of the bits in the status register. We’ll learn more about the <var>M</var> and <var>Q</var> registers when we study integer division.</p>
<pre>    MOVT    Rn  ; Rn = T (0 or 1)
</pre>
<p>There is also a special instruction to copy the <var>T</var> flag into a register. There is no converse instruction, but we’ll see later how we could try to synthesize one.</p>
<p>Windows CE requires that the <var>S</var> flag be clear at function entry and exit.</p>
<p>Since there wasn’t much to be said about flags, I’ll use the rest of my time to cover various miscellaneous instructions.</p>
<pre>    MOVA @(disp, PC), r0    ; r0 = PC + disp
</pre>
<p>The <i>move address</i> instruction calculates the effective address of <code>@(disp, PC)</code> and stores it into <var>r0</var>. The displacement can be a multiple of 4 up to 255 × 4 = 1020.</p>
<pre>    SWAP.B Rm, Rn           ; Rn = Rm with bottom two bytes swapped
    SWAP.W Rm, Rn           ; Rn = Rm with top and bottom words swapped
    XTRCT  Rm, Rn           ; Rn = (Rn &lt;&lt; 16) | (Rm &gt;&gt; 16)
</pre>
<p>These instructions are for byte swapping or extracting the middle 32 bits of a 64-bit value.</p>
<pre>    PREF  @Rn               ; prefetch memory at Rn
</pre>
<p>The prefetch instruction has no effect if the memory at <var>Rn</var> is inaccessible.</p>
<pre>    TRAPA #imm              ; trap to kernel mode
</pre>
<p>The <code>TRAPA</code> instruction traps to kernel mode. It carries an 8-bit unsigned immediate payload which kernel mode can use to signify anything it wishes.</p>
<pre>    NOP                     ; do nothing
</pre>
<p>Fortunately, the instruction <code>0000</code> is invalid, rather than being a nop.</p>
<pre>    STC     GBR, Rn         ; Rn = GBR
    LDC     Rn, GBR         ; GBR = Rn
    STC     PR, Rn          ; Rn = PR
    LDC     Rn, PR          ; PR = Rn
</pre>
<p>These instructions let you move data into and out of the special registers <var>gbr</var> and <var>pr</var>. We saw <var>gbr</var> when we learned about addressing modes. We’ll learn about <var>pr</var> when we get to control transfer.</p>
<p>Well, that wasn’t very exciting yet. Let’s start doing math. <a href="/history/the-superh-3-part-4-basic-arithmetic">Next time</a>.</p>
