<p> While it may no longer be true that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/06/07/10020654.aspx"> everything at Microsoft is built using various flavors of Visual C++ 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0</a>, there is still a kernel of truth in it: A lot of <i>customers</i> are still using Visual C++ 6.0. </p>
<p> That’s why the unofficial slogan for Visual C++ 2010 was <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/pdc2008/TL13"> <i>10 is the new 6</i></a>. Everybody on the team got a T-shirt with the slogan (because you don’t have a product <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2007/06/01/missed-metaphors.aspx"> until you have a T-shirt</a>). </p>
