<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Alas, Microsoft Building 109 Conference Room A is no more</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110621-00/?p=10383">Some time ago</a>, I noted that “Building 109 Conference Room A” was a code word for the bar at <a href="https://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;where1=3040+148th+Ave+NE,+Redmond,+WA&amp;encType=1">the Azteca restaurant next to building 109</a>. Alas, that code word is no more, because the Azteca restaurant has been demolished to make way for <a href="https://www.redmond.gov/PlansProjects/OverlakeVillageEmploymentArea/Redmond148">an apartment complex</a>. </p>
<p>But when a door closes, a new door opens. I’ve learned that the Chipotle’s next to Amazon’s new downtown Bellevue office “Everest” has been nicknamed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYGeJ64jodn/?igref=ogexp">Everest Conference Room C</a>. </p>
