<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Not from inside the Redmond Reality Distortion Field: Microsoft Streets and Trips support for ferries</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Washington State Ferry System is the largest in the United States and the second-largest in the world, but ferries are generally speaking not really a big thing in most parts of the United States. When you asked Microsoft Streets and Trips to generate a trip, one of the options was whether you wanted to include ferries. For one of my colleagues who lived in Texas, this struck him as oddly amusing. “There are boats that carry cars?”</p>
<p>It turns out that this was, for once, not a case of the Redmond Reality Distortion Field. What ultimately became the Streets and Trips product was acquired in 1994 from NextBase, and in England, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ferry_transport_in_England"> ferries are kind of a big deal</a>. So what you really have is the England Reality Distortion Field.</p>
