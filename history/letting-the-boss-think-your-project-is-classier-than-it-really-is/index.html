<p>Once upon a time, there was a team developing two versions of a product, the first a short-term project to ship soon, and the other a more ambitious project to ship later. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/22/61647.aspx">Sound familiar</a>?) They chose to assign the projects code names Ren and Stimpy, in honor of the lead characters from the <a href="http://nicktoons.nick.com/shows/the-ren-and-stimpy-show"> eponymous cartoon series</a>.
 Over time, the two projects merged, and the code name that stuck was Ren.
 When the project came up in a meeting with Bill Gates, it was mentioned verbally but never spelled out, and since Bill wasn’t closely tuned into popular culture, he mapped the sound  /rɛn/ not to the hairless Mexican dog but to the Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral. In follow-up email, he consistently referred to the project by the name “Wren”.
 The Ren team liked the fact that their name gave the boss the impression that the project was going to be a masterpiece of architectural beauty, so they never told him he got the name wrong.</p>
<p> <b>Even though it has nothing to do with the story</b>: The project in question is the one that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/technicalrecognition/dinarte-morais.aspx"> eventually became known to the world as Outlook</a>. </p>
