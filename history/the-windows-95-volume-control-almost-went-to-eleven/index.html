<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Windows 95 volume control almost went to eleven</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/"> <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i></a> introduced the world to the phrase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">going to eleven</a>. The people over at Windows Media Player were not immune to its charms, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/jamesone/archive/2006/06/02/432057.aspx"> alluding to the catchphrase in their advertising campaign</a>. </p>
<p> Back in Windows 95, I know that there was at least one person who lobbied the multimedia team to give the Volume Control program eleven notches in its control slider as a tribute. Alas, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, but it was cute to know that somebody considered the possibility. </p>
