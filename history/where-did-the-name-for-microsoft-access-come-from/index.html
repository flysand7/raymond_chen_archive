<p><a href="/history/why-is-the-microsoft-protection-service-called-msmpsvc" title="Why is the Microsoft Protection Service called "> We’ve seen</a> how <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20051114-00/?p=33353" title="What was Dr. Watson's original name?"> the names for some Microsoft products</a> had to be changed due to a name conflict. I’m told that the people who had to come up with the name for the database product avoided this pitfall in a clever way: Instead of trying to avoid a name that was already taken, they intentionally used a name that <i>was</i> already taken: By Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>They discovered that Microsoft had a long-forgotten terminal emulator product called Microsoft Access. “Access” sounded like an appropriate name for a database product, so they blew the dust off it and gave the name a new life.</p>
