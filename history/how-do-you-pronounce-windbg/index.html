<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do you pronounce WinDbg?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The debugger that comes with Debugging Tools for Windows goes by the name <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">WinDbg</a>, short for <i>Windows Debugger</i>, and generally pronounced <i>win-debug</i> or <i>win-dee-bee-gee</i>. It’s part of a suite of lightweight debuggers, along with <code>ntsd</code> (short for <i>NT Symbolic Debugger</i>) and <code>cdb</code> (<i>Console Debugger</i>), which are all based on the same debugging engine, creatively named <code>DbgEng</code>.</p>
<p>However, the question was how <i>I</i> pronounce it, and I pronounce it the same way as many other old-timers: We call it <i>windbag</i>.</p>
