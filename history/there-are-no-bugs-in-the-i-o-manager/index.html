<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zbikowski">Mark Zbikowski</a> told me a story from the early Windows NT days. </p>
<p> He found a race condition in the file system code and went to see the lead developer for the I/O subsystem. </p>
<p>“There are no bugs in the I/O Manager,” the developer proclaimed. </p>
<p>Mark walked through the scenario to demonstrate the problem. </p>
<p>The lead developer went to his editor and typed furiously for two or three minutes, ending with a theatrical punch of the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. </p>
<p>And he turned to Mark and proclaimed, “There are no bugs in the I/O Manager.” </p>
