<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The SuperH-3, part 9: Constants</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Loading constants on the SH-3 is a bit of a pain. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190806-00/?p=102752"> We saw that the <code>MOV</code> instruction supports an 8-bit signed immediate</a>, but what if you need to load something outside that range?</p>
<p>The assembler allows you to write this:</p>
<pre>    MOV     #value, Rn      ; load constant into Rn
</pre>
<p>If the value fits in an 8-bit signed immediate, then it uses that. Otherwise, it chooses a PC-relative <code>MOV.W</code> or <code>MOV.L</code> depending on the size of the value, and it generates the constant into the code at a point it believes that the code is unreachable, such as two instructions after a <code>bra</code> or <code>rts</code>. If no such point can be found, the assembler raises an error. You can use the <code>.nopool</code> directive to prevent constants from being generated at a particular point, or <code>.pool</code> to force them to be generated.</p>
<p>If the compiler can generate the constant in two instructions, typically by combining an immediate with a shift, then the compiler will tend to prefer the two-instruction version instead of using a constants pool, especially if it can put the second half of the calculation into an otherwise-wasted branch delay slot. (Yes, we haven’t learned about branch delay slots yet. Be patient.)</p>
<pre>    ; for -256 ≤ value &lt; 256, multiples of 2
    MOV    #value / 2, Rn
    SHLL   Rn

    ; for -512 ≤ value &lt; 512, multiples of 4
    MOV    #value / 4, Rn
    SHLL2  Rn

    ; for -65536 ≤ value &lt; 65536, multiples of 256
    MOV    #value / 256, Rn
    SHLL8  Rn

    ; for -16777216 ≤ value &lt; 16777216, multiples of 65536
    MOV    #value / 65536, Rn
    SHLL16 Rn
</pre>
<p>Other instructions that could be useful for building constants are logical right shift and rotate. I’m not going to write them out, though. Use your imagination.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem cumbersome to have to use two instructions to generate a constant, but remember that these instructions are only 16 bits in size, so you can fit two of them in the space of a single MIPS, PowerPC, or Alpha AXP instruction. And if you can schedule the instructions properly, the fact that the SH-3 is dual-issue means that each of the instructions executes in a half-cycle, so the pair of them takes a single cycle, assuming you can schedule another instruction between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190816-00/?p=102788"> Next up are the control transfer instructions</a>, and the return of the confusing branch delay slot, but the SH-3 adds more wrinkles to make them even more confusing.</p>
