<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't you set the command prompt's current directory to a UNC?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you try to set the current directory of a command prompt, you get the error message “CMD does not support UNC paths as current directories.” What’s going on here?
 It’s MS-DOS backwards compatibility.
 If the current directory were a UNC, there wouldn’t be anything to return to MS-DOS programs when they call function 19h (Get current drive). That function has no way to return an error code, so you have to return a drive letter. UNCs don’t have a drive letter.
 You can work around this behavior by using the <code>pushd</code> command to create a temporary drive letter for the UNC. Instead of passing <code>script.cmd</code> to the <code>CreateProcess</code> function as the <code>lpCommandLine</code>, you can pass <code>cmd.exe /c pushd \\server\share &amp;&amp; script.cmd</code>.</p>
<p> (Griping that seems to happen any time I write about batch files, so I’ll gripe them pre-emptively: Yes, the batch “language” sucks because it wasn’t designed; it just evolved. I write this not because I expect you to enjoy writing batch files but because you might find yourself forced to deal with them. If you would rather abandon batch files and use a different command interpreter altogether, then more power to you.) </p>
