<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the syntax for touching a file from the command prompt so strange?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/69581">
The magic incantation for updating the last-modified date on a
file</a>
is
</p>
<pre>
COPY /B FILE+,,
</pre>
<p>
What strange syntax!
What’s with the plus sign and the commas, anyway?
</p>
<p>
The formal syntax is the much more straightforward
</p>
<pre>
COPY /B A+B+C+D
</pre>
<p>
This means to start with the file <code>A</code>,
then append the files <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code>,
treating them all as binary files.
</p>
<p>
If you omit the
<code>B+C+D</code> part,
then you get
</p>
<pre>
COPY /B A+
</pre>
<p>
This means
“Start with A, then append nothing.”
The side effect is that the last-write time gets updated,
because the command processor opens <code>A</code> for append,
writes nothing,
then closes the handle.
</p>
<p>
That syntax has worked since at least MS-DOS 2.1
(the earliest version I still have a virtual machine for).
</p>
<p>
I dont know where the two-comma version came from,
but it most likely exploited a parsing glitch in
<code>COMMAND.COM</code>,
and somehow this variant gained traction and
became the version everybody used
(even though the other version is two keystrokes shorter).
As a result, this weird syntax has become grandfathered
as a special-case in the <code>CMD.EXE</code> parser.
Here’s some actual code from the part of
<code>CMD.EXE</code> which parses the arguments to the
<code>COPY</code> command:
</p>
<pre>
if (parse_state == SEEN_TWO_COMMAS)
    copy_mode = TOUCH;
</pre>
