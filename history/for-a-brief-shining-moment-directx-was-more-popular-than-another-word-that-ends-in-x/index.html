<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">For a brief shining moment, DirectX was more popular than another word that ends in x</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In the month after DirectX 3 was released, “directx” became the number one most-searched-for term on <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a>. That in itself wasn’t too surprising. What was more surprising was the word in sixth place: “sex”. </p>
<p> That puzzles me to this day. What kind of people search for “sex” on microsoft.com? And what were they expecting to find? </p>
