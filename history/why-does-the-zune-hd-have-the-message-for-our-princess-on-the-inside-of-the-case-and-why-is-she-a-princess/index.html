<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the Zune HD have the message “For our Princess” on the inside of the case, and why is she a princess?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Inside the Zune HD case is engraved <a href="https://gizmodo.com/5359740/zune-hd-disassembly-reveals-touching-dedication">the message <i>For our Princess</i></a>. </p>
<p>The message is a tribute to an administrative assistant on the Zune team who passed away during development of the project. </p>
<p>She gained the nickname <i>Princess</i> from a group she worked in before joining the Zune team. Another administrative assistant on the team dubbed herself <i>Queen of Everything</i>. In response, she became the <i>Princess of Everything Else</i>. </p>
