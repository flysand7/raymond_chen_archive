<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the <code>main()</code> function always at address 0x00401000 in a simple program?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you compile a simple C or C++ program, and then load it into the debugger as a dump file (or if you execute the program with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization"> ASLR</a> disabled), you’ll find that the <code>main</code> function is at offset <code>0x00401000</code>. What is so special about this address?</p>
<p>It’s the result of multiple technical decisions that add together, literally.</p>
<p>Your simple C or C++ program has only one function: <code>main</code>. It is therefore the function at the start of your code section, and the address of the <code>main</code> function is the address of the code section.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the code section is the first section of a Windows Portable Executable file. There’s no technical reason for it, but <i>somebody</i> has to go first, and code seems to be the natural choice since it’s almost always the most important part of the module. (“Primary reason for existence” in most cases.)</p>
<p>Sections are page-aligned because each section specifies its protection, and memory protection is applied at the page level. Therefore, the offset of the code section must be a multiple of the page size, which <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210510-00/?p=105200" title="What are the page sizes used by Windows on various processors?"> for x86 is 4KB</a>.</p>
<p>The page at offset zero contains the module header information.</p>
<p>Therefore the first page available for the code section is the page at offset <code>0x1000</code>.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle is that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141003-00/?p=43923"> <code>0x00400000</code> is the default base address for executables</a> on x86.</p>
<p>Put all of these decisions together (some technical, some arbitrary), and you find that the address of the <code>main()</code> function in a simple program is always <code>0x00401000</code>.</p>
