<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The SuperH-3, part 8: Bit shifting</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The bit shifting operations are fairly straightforward.</p>
<pre>    ; arithmetic (signed) shifts
    SHAL Rn         ; Rn &lt;&lt;= 1, T = the bit shifted out
    SHAR Rn         ; Rn &gt;&gt;= 1, T = the bit shifted out

    ; logical (unsigned) shifts
    SHLL Rn         ; Rn &lt;&lt;= 1, T = the bit shifted out
    SHLR Rn         ; Rn &gt;&gt;= 1, T = the bit shifted out
    SHLL2 Rn        ; Rn &lt;&lt;= 2
    SHLR2 Rn        ; Rn &gt;&gt;= 2
    SHLL8 Rn        ; Rn &lt;&lt;= 8
    SHLR8 Rn        ; Rn &gt;&gt;= 8
    SHLL16 Rn       ; Rn &lt;&lt;= 16
    SHLR16 Rn       ; Rn &gt;&gt;= 16
</pre>
<p>You cannot shift by arbitrary constant amounts. Only certain fixed values are permitted. If you want to shift left by, say, 9, you’ll have to construct it from a <code>SHLL8</code> and a <code>SHLL</code>.</p>
<p>Note also that <code>SHAL</code> and <code>SHLL</code> are functionally equivalent. But they have different encodings, so the designers burned an opcode for a redundant operation.</p>
<p>There are no “large shift” options for right shifts. You can perform multiple one-bit shifts, or use a variable shift:</p>
<pre>    SHAD Rm, Rn     ; if Rm &gt; 0: Rn &lt;&lt;= (31 &amp; Rm)
                    ; if Rm = 0: nop
                    ; if Rm &lt; 0: Rn &gt;&gt;= (31 &amp; -Rm), signed

    SHLD Rm, Rn     ; if Rm &gt; 0: Rn &lt;&lt;= (31 &amp; Rm)
                    ; if Rm = 0: nop
                    ; if Rm &lt; 0: Rn &gt;&gt;= (31 &amp; -Rm), unsigned
</pre>
<p>Note that these shift instructions shift both left <i>and</i> right, depending on the sign of the shift amount. If you want to shift right by an amount in a register, you therefore need to negate the value, and then shift left.</p>
<p>Finally, we have rotation.</p>
<pre>    ROTL Rn        ; rotate left, T contains carried-out bit
    ROTR Rn        ; rotate right, T contains carried-out bit
    ROTCL Rn       ; 33-bit rotate through T
    ROTCR Rn       ; 33-bit rotate through T
</pre>
<p>The rotation instructions rotate either a 32-bit or 33-bit value by one position. For the 32-bit rotations, the bit that rotated off the end is copied to <var>T</var>. For the 33-bit rotations, the <var>T</var> flag acts as the 33rd bit.</p>
<p>We saw earlier that there is no <code>NEGV</code> instruction. To detect overflow from a negation, you just have to check for the value <code>0x80000000</code> directly. Here’s the shortest sequence I could come up with:</p>
<pre>    ; branch if Rn equals 0x80000000
    rotl Rn        ; rotate left one bit
    dt   Rn        ; decrement and test for zero
    bt   underflow ; Y: underflow occurred
</pre>
<p>The result of the <code>DT</code> is zero if the previous value was 1, and the previous value was 1 if the original value was <code>0x80000000</code>.</p>
<p>This is a destructive operation, so do it in a scratch register. You should have one available, since it’s the source register for the <code>NEGV</code> you were checking.</p>
