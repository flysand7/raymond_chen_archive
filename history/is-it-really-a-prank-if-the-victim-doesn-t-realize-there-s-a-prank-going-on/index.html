<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is it really a prank if the victim doesn’t realize there’s a prank going on?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>One of my friends pranked a colleague by surreptitiously putting a program in the Startup group. This program opened a network socket and awaited further instructions. </p>
<p>Things you could tell the program to do: </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a thread and put it into a 100% CPU loop. 
<li>Allocate a megabyte of memory (hey, that was a lot back in the day)     and go into a loop accessing every byte of memory     over and over again. 
<li>Display a message on the screen. 
<li>Play a beep. 
<li>Perhaps some other pranky things, I forget. </li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>My friend told the program to create a thread and peg the CPU, and his colleague didn’t notice. </p>
<p>Create a second thread. </p>
<p>Still no reaction. </p>
<p>Allocate a megabyte of memory. </p>
<p>Two megabytes. </p>
<p>Four megabytes. </p>
<p>Still nothing. </p>
<p>Beep a few times for no apparent reason. </p>
<p>No reaction. </p>
<p>My friend now decided to pull out all the stops. Create eight threads, each in a CPU spin loop. Allocate another 16 megabytes of memory. Beep five times in a row. Display a message box with a nonsensical error message. (I forget exactly what it was. Let’s say it’s “Printer out of bamboo. Get more bamboo. MOAR!”) </p>
<p>My friend’s colleague shrugged and dismissed the error message. </p>
<p>I think my friend had to display a message box that said “Look behind you” before his colleague finally clued in that he was being pranked. </p>
<p>So you tell me. Was this a successful prank or not, if the victim didn’t even realize that he was being pranked? </p>
