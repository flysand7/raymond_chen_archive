<p>Commenter asdf wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#705378"> where <code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code> came from</a>.
 The <code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code> symbol was introduced in the Windows 95 time frame as a way to exclude a bunch of Windows header files when you include <code>windows.h</code>. You can take a look at your <code>windows.h</code> file to see which ones they are.
 The symbol was added as part of the transition from 16-bit Windows to 32-bit Windows. The 16-bit <code>windows.h</code> header file didn’t include all of those header files, and defining <code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code> brought you back to the 16-bit Windows philosophy of a minimal set of header files for writing a bare-bones Windows program. This appeased the programmers who liked to micro-manage their header files, and it was a big help because, at the time the symbol was introduced, precompiled header files were not in common use. As I recall, on a 50MHz 80486 with 8MB of memory, switching to <code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code> shaved three seconds off the compile time of each C file. When your project consists of 20 C files, that’s a whole minute saved right there.</p>
<p> Moore’s Law and precompiled headers have conspired to render the <code>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</code> symbol relative useless. It doesn’t really save you much any more. But at one point, it did. </p>
