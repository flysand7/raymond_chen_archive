<p> Back in Windows 95, there was one bug that was originally filed against the window manager team. Upon closer investigation, the window manager team determined that the bug was really in the video driver and  added their analysis to the bug as they reassigned it. I don’t know what overcame them, but the analysis was written in iambic pentameter. (It may have been rhymed couplets; my memory is kind of hazy. Gosh, I hope it wasn’t haiku.) </p>
<p> At any rate, the device driver team added one comment to the bug immediately upon receiving it: “We ain’t much fer book lernin’.” </p>
