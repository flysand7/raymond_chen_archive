<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is in the "Windows 95 Special Edition" box?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         At the Windows 95 Launch and at various other marketing events, guests were given         a copy of “Windows 95 Special Edition”. What is so special about the box?      </p>
<p>         Answer: The box.      </p>
<p>         The contents of the box are exactly the same as a regular copy of Windows 95. The         only thing special about it is the box itself.      </p>
