<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The sad demise of whimsical teasing in Comic Chat</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Internet Explorer 3 came with the IRC client <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/vwg/projectsheets/comicchat.htm"> Comic Chat</a>, a product from the research division. And it’s not surprising that a program as goofy as Comic Chat would put something goofy in the default profile. If you didn’t set a profile when you created your character, it defaulted to “This person is too lazy to create a profile entry.” </p>
<p> Of course, it wasn’t long before people complained that <a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/UsingInternet/ch24/ch24.htm#09"> the text was snotty</a>. So much for trying to be funny. </p>
