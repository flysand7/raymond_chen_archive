<p>         Doo, dudududingggggg…. ding…. ding… ding…      </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/06/02/PK70006.DTL">In         an interview with Joel Selvin at the San Francisco Chronicle, Brian Eno explains</a>.      </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>         Q: How did you come to compose “The Microsoft Sound”?      </p>
<p>         A: The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I’d been working         on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated         someone coming along and saying, “Here’s a specific problem — solve it.”      </p>
<p>         The thing from the agency said, “We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal,         blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,” this whole list         of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said “and it must be 3 1/4 seconds long.”      </p>
<p>         I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little         piece of music. It’s like making a tiny little jewel.      </p>
<p>         In fact, I made 84 pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces         of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke         a logjam in my own work. Then when I’d finished that and I went back to working with         pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.       </p></blockquote>
<p>         The Windows 95 CD contained extra multimedia toss-ins. The ones I remember are a cartoon         or two by <a href="http://www.awn.com/plympton/">Bill Plympton</a>, a <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a> music         video, and music video of <a href="http://www.newbohemians.com/">Edie Brickell</a> singing <i>Good         Times</i>.      </p>
<p>         For some reason, everybody wanted to know the artist from the <i>Good Times</i> video.         Nobody was interested in the artists who did any of the other stuff. (Okay, probably         nobody asked about Weezer because, well, that’s the group right there in the filename.)      </p>
<p>         Hint: Right-click and select Properties. That will tell you the artist.      </p>
<p>         Oh, and the question nobody asked but I’m going to answer it anyway: <a href="http://www.brianorr.com/">The         composer of the Windows 95 Easter Egg theme is Brian Orr</a>. <a href="http://www.brianorr.com/music/compositions/clients.asp">Here’s         his story of how it came to be</a>.      </p>
