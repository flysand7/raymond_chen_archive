<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are Windows setup logs stored in a Panther directory? Does it have anything to do with the abandoned Panther project from the precursor to Windows 95?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx">I discussed the fates of the various cat projects that led to Windows 95</a>, which was in turn a follow-up to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/20/10526823.aspx">a list of cat-related code names from projects that led to Windows 95</a>. </p>
<p>In summary: There were a bunch of projects with cat-related code names. Only one of the projects survived to Windows 95 in its originally-envisioned form. Two of the projects were morphed into other projects that became part of Windows 95. One (Panther) was cancelled outright. </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx#10608939">More than</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx#10608986">one person</a> asked whether the canceled Panther project is why Windows Setup logs are in a directory called “Panther”. </p>
<p>I doubt it. </p>
<p>After all, the Panther project was cancelled early in the exploratory phase of the product that eventually became Windows 95. No public builds were ever released that contained Panther. </p>
<p>You launched Panther by launching Windows 3.1, then going to Program Manager, and double-clicking the icon of a Hallowe’en pumpkin. </p>
<p>I don’t know why the Panther icon was a Hallowe’en pumpkin. Maybe the project started on Hallowe’en? </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Panther subdirectory that people are asking about was introduced in Windows Vista, and it is highly unlikely that Windows Vista cared about a long-dead experimental project from over 15 years ago. Windows Vista didn’t support upgrading from anything older than Windows 2000; it certainly didn’t care about upgrading from an experimental operating system from the early 1990s that never even made it as far as a beta. </p>
<p>From looking at the source code history, it appears that Panther was the code name for what is now known as Windows Deployment Services. </p>
<p>Another case of code name reuse. </p>
