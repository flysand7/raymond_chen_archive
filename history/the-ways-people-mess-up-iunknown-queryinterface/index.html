<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The ways people mess up IUnknown::QueryInterface</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
When you’re dealing with application compatibility,
you discover all sorts of things that worked only by accident.
Today, I’ll talk about some of the “creative” ways people
mess up the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/com/htm/cmi_q2z_7fvp.asp">
IUnknown::QueryInterface method</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, you’d think, “This interface is so critical to COM,
how could anybody possible mess it up?”
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Forgetting to respond to IUnknown.
<dd>
<p>
Sometimes you get so excited about responding to all these
great interfaces that you forget to respond to IUnknown itself.
We have found objects where</p>
<pre>
IShellFolder *psf = some object;
IUnknown *punk;
psf-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IUnknown, (void**)&amp;punk);
</pre>
<p>fails with E_NOINTERFACE!
</p>
<dt>Forgetting to respond to your own interface.
<dd>
<p>
There are some methods which return an object with a specific
interface. And if you query that object for its own interface,
its sole reason for existing, it says “Huh?”
</p>
<pre>
IShellFolder *psf = some object;
IEnumIDList *peidl, *peidl2;
psf-&gt;EnumObjects(..., &amp;peidl);
peidl-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IEnumIDList, (void**)&amp;peidl2);
</pre>
<p>
There are some objects which return E_NOINTERFACE to the QueryInterface
call, even though you’re asking the object for itself!
“Sorry, I don’t exist,” it seems they’re trying to say.
</p>
<dt>Forgetting to respond to base interfaces.
<dd>
<p>
When you implement a derived interface, you implicitly implement
the base interfaces, so don’t forget to respond to them, too.</p>
<pre>
IShellView *psv = some object;
IOleView *pow;
psv-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IOleView, (void**)&amp;pow);
</pre>
<p>Some objects forget and the QueryInterface fails with E_NOINTERFACE.
</p>
<dt>Requiring a secret knock.
<dd>
<p>
In principle, the following two code fragments are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
IShellFolder *psf;
IUnknown *punk;
CoCreateInstance(CLSID_xyz, ..., IID_IShellFolder, (void**)&amp;psf);
psf-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IUnknown, (void**)&amp;punk);
CoCreateInstance(CLSID_xyz, ..., IID_IUnknown, (void**)&amp;punk);
punk-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IShellFolder, (void**)&amp;psf);
</pre>
<p>
In reality, some implementations mess up and fail the second call
to CoCreateInstance. The only way to create the object successfully
is to create it with the IShellFolder interface.
</p>
<dt>Forgetting to say “no” properly.
<dd>
<p>
One of the rules for saying “no” is that you have to set the
output pointer to NULL before returning.  Some people forget to do
that.
</p>
<pre>
IMumble *pmbl;
punk-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IMumble, (void**)&amp;pmbl);
</pre>
<p>
If the QueryInterface succeeds, then pmbl must be non-NULL on return.
If it fails, then pmbl <strong>must be NULL on return</strong>.
</p>
</dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
<p>
The shell has to be compatible with all these buggy objects because
if it weren’t, customers would get upset and the press would have
a field day.  Some of the offenders
are big-name programs. If they broke, people would report,
“Don’t upgrade to Windows XYZ, it’s not compatible with
&lt;big-name program&gt;.”
Conspiracy-minded folks would shout,
“Microsoft intentionally broke &lt;big-name program&gt;!
Proof of unfair business tactics!”
