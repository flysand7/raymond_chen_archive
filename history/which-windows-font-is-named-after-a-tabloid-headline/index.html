<p> Daniel Will-Harris <a href="http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm"> explains the background of several Windows fonts</a>, including the story of where the names for some of the fonts came from. Do you know which Windows font is named after a tabloid headline about aliens? </p>
<p> On the topic of font history, the designer of Comic Sans, Vincent Connare, has written a bit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/fonts/comicsns/default.htm"> on the font’s history</a> on Microsoft’s typography site, as well as <a href="http://www.connare.com/comic.htm"> a longer discussion</a> on his personal site. </p>
