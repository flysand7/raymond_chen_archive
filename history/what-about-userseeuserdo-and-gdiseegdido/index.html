<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What about USERSEEUSERDO and GDISEEGDIDO?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In Windows 3.1, there were undocumented functions named <code>USER­SEE­USER­DO</code> and <code>GDI­SEE­GDI­DO</code>. Surely there’s a story behind these funny names.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>These functions were used for internal testing purposes. They allowed stress tests to do things like allocate extra memory in the desktop heap in order to trigger low-memory conditions in the window manager. They also were used by the 16-bit tool helper library to do things like enumerate all the window classes that have been registered.</p>
<p>The name of the <code>USER­SEE­USER­DO</code> function is evidently a play on the idiom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_see,_monkey_do"> <i>monkey see, monkey do</i></a>. In this case, <code>USER</code> is the thing being told to do various strange things, and it dutifully does them. But it’s also a joke, because the word <i>user</i> here could be interpreted as referring to the end user.</p>
<p>The <code>GDI­SEE­GDI­DO</code> function arrived later, and its name was patterned after <code>USER­SEE­USER­DO</code>. Nevermind that it’s really not much of a joke.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Some of the random things that <code>USER­SEE­USER­DO</code> and <code>GDI­SEE­GDI­DO</code> did have been formalized in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getguiresources"> <code>Get­Gui­Resources</code> function</a>.</p>
