<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Yes, the Windows 7 beta wallpaper was a picture of a betta fish</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It wasn’t long before people realized that the fish in the default wallpaper for the Windows 7 beta was a betta fish. This was intended to be a cute little pun, though some people <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Story-of-the-Windows-7-Beta-Fish-101857.shtml"> took the semiotics to an extreme</a>,
 Dude, this is Windows, not <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. It’s not like the people who chose the wallpaper are using a backchannel to pass secret messages to you like “I know I’m not supposed to tell you, but here’s the Windows product schedule” or “Help, I’m trapped in a wallpaper factory!” They’re just having a bit of fun.
 I have yet to see anybody point out that the fish was blowing <i>seven</i> bubbles. And no, I don’t know what it “signifies”.</p>
<p> (I always wonder about the people who claim that the government embeds subtle messages about their complex conspiracies in plain sight. If you want to keep a secret, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/russkafin/fcrules.html"> you don’t run around talking about it</a><a>!) </a></p>
