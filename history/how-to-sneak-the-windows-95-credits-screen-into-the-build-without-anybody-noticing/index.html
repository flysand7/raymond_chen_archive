<p>The hidden Windows 95 credits screen was snuck into the build under cover of darkness.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not, but it was snuck in.</p>
<p>The code for the Windows 95 credits was snuck into <code>shell32.dll</code>, in part by writing it in an obscure language nobody understood.</p>
<p>It was written in C++.</p>
<p>At the time, C was the well-tested, well-supported language, having been <i>de facto</i> standardized since 1978 (K&amp;R) and formally standardized since 1989. The C++ language wouldn’t become standardized until 1998. C++ was the language to use if you wanted to live dangerously on the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>The code for the credits is the only code in the Windows 95 shell that was written in C++. Aside from a small amount of assembly language, everything else is in C.¹</p>

<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Even though Brian in the video says that management mustn’t find out, at least one manager did know about it, because I remember sitting in their office to go over the list of names to include.</p>
<p>¹ The Windows 95 shell was COM-based, but it used COM in C. So don’t say it can’t be done.</p>
