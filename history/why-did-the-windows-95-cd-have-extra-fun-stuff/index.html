<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449866.aspx#449901"> Why did the Windows 95 CD have extra fun stuff</a>, like the <i>Good Times</i> and <i>Buddy Holly</i> music videos, the <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114287/">Rob Roy</a></i> trailer, and the cartoons by <a href="http://www.plymptoons.com/"> Bill Plympton</a>? Because it was fun! Why does one have to justify having fun?
 In addition to the multimedia fun, there was also video game fun, with the addition of Pinball and the mercifully-forgotten hovercraft game <i>Hover!</i> (Some of us thought it was so awful, we secretly called it <i><a href="http://www.hoover.com/">Hoover!</a></i>)</p>
