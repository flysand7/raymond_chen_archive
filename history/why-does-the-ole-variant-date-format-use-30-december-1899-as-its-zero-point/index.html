<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the OLE variant date format use 30 December 1899 as its zero point?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In 2006, via the suggestion box, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#761881"> Chris J asks why the OLE variant date format has such a strange zero point</a>. Its zero point is 30 December 1899, as opposed to 1 January 1900 (SQL Server’s zero point) or 1 January 1970 (the unix zero point).
 It turns out I don’t have to answer this because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/09/16/eric-s-complete-guide-to-vt-date.aspx"> Eric Lippert explained it three years before the question was posted</a>, and then some time later posted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2009/06/01/bug-psychology.aspx"> a puzzle regarding date calculations</a>.</p>
