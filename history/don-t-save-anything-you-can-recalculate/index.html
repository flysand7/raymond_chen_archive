<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don’t save anything you can recalculate</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Nowadays, a major barrier to performance for many classes of programs is paging. We saw earlier this year that <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/17/91178.aspx"> paging can kill a server</a>. Today, another example of how performance became tied to paging.</p>
<p> The principle is “Don’t save anything you can recalculate.” This of course, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/16/317157.aspx"> seems counterintuitive</a>: Shouldn’t you save the answer so you don’t have to recalculate it? </p>
<p> The answer is, “It depends.” </p>
<p> If recalculating the answer isn’t very expensive and has good data locality, then you may be better off recalculating it than saving it, especially if saving it <strong>reduces</strong> locality. For example, if the result is stored in a separate object, you now have to touch a second object—risking a page fault—to get the saved answer. </p>
<p> Last time, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/17/323556.aspx"> we saw how Windows 95 applied this principle</a> so that rebasing a DLL didn’t thrash your machine. I’m told that the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857911033.aspx"> Access</a> team used this principle to reap significant performance gains. Instead of caching results, they just threw them away and recalculated them the next time they were needed. </p>
<p> Whether this technique works for you is hard to predict. If your program is processor-bound, then caching computations is probably a good idea. But if your program is memory-bound, then you may be better off getting rid of the cache, since the cache is just creating more memory pressure. </p>
