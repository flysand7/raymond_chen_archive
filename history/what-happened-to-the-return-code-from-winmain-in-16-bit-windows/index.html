<p>Commenter S asks, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#2645703">What happened to the return code from WinMain in a Windows 3.1 app</a>?” After all, there was no <code>GetExitCodeProcess</code> function in 16-bit Windows.
 Basically, the exit code vanished into the ether.
 Unless you captured it.
 The Toolhelp library provided a low-level hook into various parts of the kernel, allowing you to monitor, among other things, the creation and destruction of tasks. That was <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/84456"> how you captured the return code of a Windows program in 16-bit Windows</a>.</p>
<p> But if you didn’t catch it as it happened, it was gone forever, lost in the ether. </p>
