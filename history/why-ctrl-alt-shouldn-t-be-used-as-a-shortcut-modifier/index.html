<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why Ctrl+Alt shouldn't be used as a shortcut modifier</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>You may have noticed that Windows doesn’t use Ctrl+Alt  as a keyboard shortcut anywhere.  (Or at least it shouldn’t.)  If a chorded modifier is needed, it’s usually Ctrl+Shift.
  That’s because Ctrl+Alt has special meaning on many  keyboards.  The combination Ctrl+Alt is also known as AltGr,  and it acts as an alternate shift key.  For example, consider the  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/dis_v1/disv1.asp?DID=dis45d&amp;File=S25B8_n.asp">  German keyboard layout</a>.  Notice that there are three keyboard shift states  (Normal, Shift, and AltGr),  whereas on U.S. keyboards there are only two  (Normal and Shift).  For example, to type the @ character on a German keyboard,  you would type AltGr+Q = Ctrl+Alt+Q.  (Some languages, like Swedish, have a fourth state: Shift+AltGr.  And then of course, there’s the Japanese keyboard…)
  Most international keyboards remap the right-hand Alt key  to act as AltGr, so instead of the finger-contorting Ctrl+Alt+Q,  you can usually type RAlt+Q.
  (For reference,  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/dis_v1/disv1.asp?DID=dis45d&amp;File=S25B8.asp">  here are diagrams of several other keyboard layouts</a>,  courtesy of  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnintl/html/dnintlredir.asp">  my bubble-blowing friend, Nadine Kano</a>.)
  Sometimes a program accidentally uses Ctrl+Alt as a shortcut  modifier and they get bug reports like, “Every time I  type the letter ‘đ’, the program thinks I want to start  a mailmerge.”</p>
