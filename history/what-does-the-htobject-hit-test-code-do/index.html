<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the HTOBJECT hit-test code do?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Leo Davidson observes that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/02/18/10131176.aspx#10131439">
a hit-test code is defined for
<code>HTOBJECT</code></a>, but it is not documented, and wonders
what’s up.
</p>
<pre>
#define HTOBJECT            19
</pre>
<p>
The <code>HTOBJECT</code> is another one of those features
that never got implemented.
The code does nothing and nobody uses it.
It was added back in Windows 95 for reasons lost to the
mists of time,
but when the reason for adding it vanished (maybe a feature got cut),
it was too late to remove it from the header file because that would
require renumbering <code>HTCLOSE</code> and <code>HTHELP</code>,
two values which were in widespread use already.
So the value just stayed in the header file,

taking up space but accomplishing nothing</a>.</p>
