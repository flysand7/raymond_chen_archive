<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My pants are fancy!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>During the development of Windows, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/usability/default.aspx"> User Research team</a> tried out an early build of some proposed changes on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/usability/enroll.aspx"> volunteers from the general community</a>. During one of the tests, they invited the volunteer to just play around with a particular component, to explore it the way they would at home.
 The usability subject scrolled around a bit, admired the visuals, selected a few things, and then had an idea to try to customize the component. He fiddled around a bit and quickly discovered the customization feaure.
 To celebrate his success, he proudly announced in a sing-song sort of way, “My pants are fancy!”</p>
<p> That clip of a happy usability study participant gleefully announcing “My pants are fancy!” tickled the team’s funny bone, and the phrase “My pants are fancy” became a catch phrase. </p>
