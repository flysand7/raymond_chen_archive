<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What was the ShowCursor function intended to be used for?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Back in the days when Windows was introduced,
a mouse was a fancy newfangled gadget
which not everybody had on their machine.
Windows acknowledged this and supported systems without
a mouse by having keyboard accelerators for everything
(or at least that was the intent).
But if the design stopped there, you’d have a dead cursor
in the middle of your screen all the time,
which you could move around if you had a mouse,
which you didn’t.
</p>
<p>
Enter the <code>ShowCursor</code> function.
</p>
<p>
The <code>ShowCursor</code> function takes a parameter
that indicates whether you want to show or hide the cursor.
(It would perhaps be more verbosely named
<code>ChangeCursorShowState</code>.)
If you call <code>ShowCursor(TRUE)</code> then the cursor
show count is incremented by one;
if you call <code>ShowCursor(FALSE)</code> then the cursor
show count is decremented by one.
A cursor is show on the screen if the cursor show count is greater
than or equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
When Windows starts up, it checks if you have a mouse.
If so, then the cursor show count is initialized to zero;
otherwise, it is initialized to negative one.
That way, you don’t get an annoying immovable cursor on the screen
if you don’t have a mouse.
</p>
<p>
If a program entered a state where it wanted to show the cursor
even on systems without a mouse, it would call
<code>ShowCursor(TRUE)</code> when it entered the state,
and
<code>ShowCursor(FALSE)</code> when it left it.
One such state might be when activating the keyboard interface
for selecting a rectangular region in a document.
Under these conditions, a program naturally is expected to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/06/3716170.aspx#3838293">
move the cursor around in response to user actions</a>,
even if the user didn’t move the physical mouse hardware.
</p>
<p>
But the most common reason for forcing the cursor to be shown
is in order to show an hourglass cursor because it’s busy.
That’s right, back in the mouseless days, code to display
an hourglass cursor went like this:</p>
<pre>
HCURSOR hcurPrev = SetCursor(LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_WAIT));
<font color="blue">ShowCursor(TRUE); // force cursor shown on mouseless systems</font>
... perform long operation ...
<font color="blue">ShowCursor(FALSE); // re-hide cursor on mouseless systems</font>
SetCursor(hcurPrev);
</pre>
<p>
Conversely, if a program entered a state where it wanted to hide
the cursor even on systems with a mouse, it would call
<code>ShowCursor(FALSE)</code> when it entered the state,
and
<code>ShowCursor(TRUE)</code> when it left it.
For example, you might do this when showing a slide show.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at how this all worked out in practice.
I use a table because people seem to like tables.
</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black"></td>
<th style="border: solid .75pt black">Machine with mouse</th>
<th style="border: solid .75pt black">Machine without mouse</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black">Normal</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">0 (cursor shown)</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">-1 (cursor hidden)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="border: solid .75pt black">Enter mode where cursor should be forced shown</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black"><code>ShowCursor(TRUE)</code></td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">1 (cursor shown)</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">0 (cursor shown)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="border: solid .75pt black">Exit mode where cursor should be forced shown</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black"><code>ShowCursor(FALSE)</code></td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">0 (cursor shown)</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">-1 (cursor hidden)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="border: solid .75pt black">Enter mode where cursor should be forced hidden</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black"><code>ShowCursor(FALSE)</code></td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">-1 (cursor hidden)</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">-2 (cursor hidden)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th colspan="3" style="border: solid .75pt black">Exit mode where cursor should be forced hidden</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: solid .75pt black"><code>ShowCursor(TRUE)</code></td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">0 (cursor shown)</td>
<td align="right" style="border: solid .75pt black">-1 (cursor hidden)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Now that all systems come with a mouse as standard equipment,
this historical information is not of much use,
but there it is in case you were wondering.
(And in a case of <i>everything old is new again</i>,
the growing popularity of touch computing means that
you once again have a class of computers with no mouse.
So maybe this information is useful after all.

Just a fluke, I assure you</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Back in the old 16-bit days,
this counter was a global state,
along with other window manager states like the focus window
and the input queue.
During the conversion to Win32,
the cursor show counter became a thread-local state.
(Naturally,
multiple threads could merge their cursor show counters
by attachment.)
Consequently, when a thread calls <code>ShowCursor</code>
it affects the cursor show state only for windows that
belong to that thread.</p>
