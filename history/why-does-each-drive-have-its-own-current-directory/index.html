<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does each drive have its own current directory?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Commenter Dean Earley asks,
“<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1816690">Why is there a ‘current directory’ AND an current drive</a>?
Why not merge them?”
</p>
<p>
Pithy answer:
Originally, each drive had its own current directory,
but now they don’t, but it looks like they do.
</p>
<p>
Okay, let’s unwrap that sentence.
You actually know enough to answer the question yourself;
you just have to put the pieces together.
</p>
<p>
Set the wayback machine to DOS 1.0.
Each volume was represented by a drive letter.
There were no subdirectories.
This behavior was carried forward from CP/M.
</p>
<p>
Programs from the DOS 1.0 era
didn’t understand subdirectories;
they referred to files by just drive letter and file name,
for example,
<code>B:PROGRAM.LST</code>.
Let’s fire up the assembler
(compilers were for rich people)
and assemble a program whose source code is on the A drive,
but sending the output to the B drive.
</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code>A&gt;asm foo</code></td>
<td>     </td>
<td align="right" valign="baseline"><i>the “.asm” extension on “foo” is implied</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" valign="baseline"><code>Assembler version blah blah blah</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3" valign="baseline"><code>Source File: FOO.ASM</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code>Listing file [FOO.LST]: <u>NUL</u></code>
</td>
<td></td>
<td align="right" valign="baseline"><i><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/22/55388.aspx">throw away the listing file</a></i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="baseline"><code>Object file [FOO.OBJ]: <u>B:</u></code></td>
<td></td>
<td align="right" valign="baseline"><i>send the object file to drive B</i></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Since we gave only a drive letter in response to the
<code>Object file</code> prompt,
the assembler defaults to a file name of <code>FOO.OBJ</code>,
resulting in the object file being generated as <code>B:FOO.OBJ</code>.
</p>
<p>
Okay, now let’s introduce subdirectories into DOS 2.0.
Suppose you have want to assemble <code>A:\SRC\FOO.ASM</code>
and put the result into
<code>B:\OBJ\FOO.OBJ</code>.
Here’s how you do it:
</p>
<pre>
A&gt; B:
B&gt; CD \OBJ
B&gt; A:
A&gt; CD \SRC
A&gt; asm foo
Assembler version blah blah blah
Source File: FOO.ASM
Listing file [FOO.LST]: NUL
Object file [FOO.OBJ]: B:
</pre>
<p>
The assembler reads from <code>A:FOO.ASM</code> and writes
to <code>B:FOO.OBJ</code>,
but since the current directory is tracked on a per-drive basis,
the results are <code>A:\SRC\FOO.ASM</code> and
<code>B:\OBJ\FOO.OBJ</code> as desired.
If the current directory were not tracked on a per-drive basis,
then there would be no way to tell the assembler to put its
output into a subdirectory.
As a result,
DOS 1.0 programs were effectively limited to operating on
files in the root directory,
which means that nobody would put files in subdirectories
(because their programs couldn’t access them).
</p>
<p>
From a DOS 1.0 standpoint, changing the current directory
on a drive performs the logical equivalent of changing media.
“Oh look, a completely different set of files!”
</p>
<p>
Short attention span.
</p>
<p>
Remembering the current directory for each drive has been preserved
ever since,
at least for batch files,
although there isn’t actually such a concept as a <i>per-drive current
directory</i> in Win32.
In Win32, all you have is <i>a</i> current directory.
The appearance that each drive has its own current directory
is a fake-out by <code>cmd.exe</code>, which uses
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/06/10008132.aspx">
strange environment variables</a>
to create the illusion to batch files that each
drive has its own current directory.
</p>
<p>
Dean continues,
“Why not merge them?
I have to set both the dir and drive if i want a specific working dir.”
</p>
<p>
The answer to the second question is, “They already are merged.
It’s <code>cmd.exe</code> that tries to pretend that they aren’t.”
And if you want to set the directory and the drive from the command
prompt or a batch file, just use the <code>/D</code> option to the
<code>CHDIR</code> command:
</p>
<pre>
D:\&gt; CD /D C:\Program Files\Windows NT
C:\Program Files\Windows NT&gt; _
</pre>
<p>
(Notice that the <code>CHDIR</code> command lets you omit quotation
marks around paths which contain spaces:
Since the command takes only one path argument,
the lack of quotation marks does not introduce ambiguity.</p>
