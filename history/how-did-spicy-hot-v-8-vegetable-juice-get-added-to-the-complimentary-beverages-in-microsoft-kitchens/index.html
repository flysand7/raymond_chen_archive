<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How did Spicy Hot V-8 vegetable juice get added to the complimentary beverages in Microsoft kitchens?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today is Election Day in the United States. Don’t forget to vote. (Void where prohibited.) In honor of Election Day, I figured I’d tell a story about voting.</p>
<p> One of the complimentary beverages available in Microsoft kitchens is <a href="http://www.v8juice.com/v8.aspx?ProductID=2469"> Spicy Hot V-8</a>. (Sure it’s tasty, but watch out for <a href="http://www.johnisfit.com/2008/01/15/rethinking-the-v8/"> the sodium content</a>!) </p>
<p> I remember well when Spicy Hot V-8 was added to the refrigerators. At the 1992 Company Meeting, Bill Gates and then-head of HR <a href="http://www.presidentmurray.com/"> Mike Murray</a> appeared on stage to read questions submitted by employees ahead of time. One of the questions was “Can we carry Spicy Hot V-8 in the kitchens?” </p>
<p> Mike Murray decided to put the matter to a voice vote. </p>
<p> The measure “passed” overwhelmingly. </p>
<p> Spicy Hot V-8 appeared in the kitchens the next morning. </p>
