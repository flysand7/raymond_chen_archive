<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do I sometimes see redundant casts before casting to LPARAM?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
If you read through old code, you will often find casts
that seem redundant.
</p>
<pre>
SendMessage(hwndListBox, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, (LPARAM)(LPSTR)”string”);
</pre>
<p>
Why was <code>“string”</code> cast to <code>LPSTR</code>?
It’s already an <code>LPSTR</code>!
</p>
<p>
These are leftovers from 16-bit Windows.
Recall that in 16-bit Windows, pointers were near by default.
Consequently, <code>“string”</code> was a near pointer to a string.
If the code had been written as
<pre>
SendMessage(hwndListBox, LB_ADDSTRING, 0, (LPARAM)”string”);
</pre>
<p>
then it would have taken the near pointer and cast it to a <code>long</code>.
Since a near pointer is a 16-bit value, the pointer would have been 
zero-extended to the 32-bit size of a <code>long</code>.
</p>
<p>
However, all pointers in window messages must be far pointers
because the window procedure for the window might very well be implemented
in a different module from the sender.
Recall that near pointers are interpreted relative to the default
selector, and the default selector for each module is different.
Sending a near pointer to another module will result in the
pointer being interpreted relative to the <strong>recipient’s</strong>
default selector, which is not the same as the <strong>sender’s</strong>
default selector.
</p>
<p>
The intermediate cast to <code>LPSTR</code> converts the near
pointer to a far pointer, <code>LP</code> being the Hungarian
prefix for far pointers (also known as “long pointers”).
Casting a near pointer to a far pointer inserts the previously-implied
default selector, so that the cast to <code>LPARAM</code> captures
the full 16:16 far pointer.
</p>
<p>
Aren’t you glad you don’t have to worry about this any more?
