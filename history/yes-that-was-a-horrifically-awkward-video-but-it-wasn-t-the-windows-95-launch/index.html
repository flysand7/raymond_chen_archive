<p>This is commonly identified as having been recorded at the Windows 95 launch, but it wasn’t. The Windows 95 launch featured Jay Leno and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0CRWAz09r8#t=2m55s"> the stage looked like this</a>.

<p>So yes, it’s a bunch of people dancing like dorks, but it wasn’t the Windows 95 launch. My guess is that it was some sort of sales event.</p>
<p>One of my friends remarked, “Sure, the dancing is horrible, but I don’t think the dabbing generation is in any position to criticize another person’s dancing.”</p>
<p>Windows 95 released to manufacturing on August 24, 1995.</p>
