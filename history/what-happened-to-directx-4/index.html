<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What happened to DirectX 4?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you go through the history of DirectX, you’ll see that there is no DirectX 4. It went from DirectX 3 straight to DirectX 5. What’s up with that?</p>
<p>After DirectX 3 was released, development on two successor products took place simultaneously: a shorter-term release called DirectX 4 and a more substantial longer-term release called DirectX 5.</p>
<p>But based on the feedback we were getting from the game development community, they didn’t really care about the small features in DirectX 4; what they were much more interested in were the features of DirectX 5. So it was decided to cancel DirectX 4 and roll all of its features into DirectX 5.</p>
<p>So why wasn’t DirectX 5 renamed to DirectX 4?</p>
<p>Because there were already hundreds upon hundreds of documents that referred to the two projects as DirectX 4 and DirectX 5. Documents that said things like “Feature XYZ will not appear until DirectX 5”. Changing the name of the projects mid-cycle was going to create even more confusion. You would end up with headlines like “Microsoft removes DirectX 5 from the table – kiss good-bye to feature XYZ” and conversations reminiscent of <i><a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/humor4.shtml">Who’s on First</a></i>:</p>
<p>“I have some email from you saying that feature ABC won’t be ready until DirectX 5. When do you plan on releasing DirectX 5?”</p>
<p>“We haven’t even started planning DirectX 5; we’re completely focused on DirectX 4, which we hope to have ready by late spring.”</p>
<p>“But I need feature XYZ and you said that won’t be ready until DirectX 5.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that email was written two weeks ago. Since then, DirectX 5 got renamed to DirectX 4, and DirectX 4 was cancelled.”</p>
<p>“So when I have a letter from you talking about DirectX 5, I should pretend it says DirectX 4, and when it says DirectX 4, I should pretend it says ‘a project that has since been cancelled’?”</p>
<p>“Right, but check the date at the top of the letter, because if it’s newer than last week, then when it says DirectX 4, it really means the new DirectX 4.”</p>
<p>“And what if it says DirectX 5?”</p>
<p>“Then somebody screwed up and didn’t get the memo.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thanks. Clear as mud.”</p>
