<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Today is tax day, but it’s also division meeting day, so let’s get you some forms to fill out</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, there was a division-wide meeting for all of the Windows product team. <a href="https://www.meydenbauer.com/">A local convention center</a> was rented out for the occasion, buses were hired to shuttle employees to and from the venue, the usual “very large meeting” nonsense. </p>
<p>The meeting happened to be scheduled for April 15, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Day">the day that individual income taxes are due in the United States</a>. </p>
<p>The organizers of the meeting recognized this, and when employees entered the lobby to check in for the meeting, the organizers provided copies of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/extension-of-time-to-file-your-tax-return">Form 4868: Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return</a> to anyone who wanted one, as well pre-addressed envelopes for mailing it in. </p>
<p>It was a cute joke, but I saw people taking advantage of it, so maybe it was for practical purposes after all. </p>
