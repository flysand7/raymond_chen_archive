<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do up-down controls have the arrows backwards?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you create <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/updown/updown.asp"> an up-down control</a> (some people call a “spinner” control) in its default configuration, the up-arrow decrements the value and the down-arrow increments it. Most people expect the up-arrow to increment and the down-arrow to decrement. Why is it backwards?</p>
<p> The up-down control is a victim of Windows’ reversed <i>y</i>-axis. </p>
<p> Mathematically, the (0, 0) coordinate should be at the bottom left corner of the screen (and in fact that’s where OS/2 puts it), with <i>y</i> increasing as you move up the screen. Windows, on the other hand, puts the (0, 0) coordinate at the <strong>upper</strong> left corner, with <i>y</i> increasing as you move <strong>down</strong> the screen. </p>
<p> What does that have to do with anything? </p>
<p> The up-down control can be positioned horizontally or vertically. Let’s first look at the less problematic horizontal configuration. Windows and mathematics agree that the <i>x</i> coordinate increases to the right, and the right-arrow (the arrow with higher <i>x</i>-coordinate) causes the value to increase. (Let’s leave right-to-left languages out of the picture for the purpose of this discussion.) </p>
<p> Once you have the horizontal version of the control working, converting it to a vertical control is a simple matter of interchanging the <i>x</i>– and <i>y</i>-axes. </p>
<p> That’s why the up-arrow decreases the value. The up-arrow points towards smaller <i>y</i>-coordinates and consequently decrements the value. </p>
<p> It’s perfectly logical and simultaneously counter-intuitive. (It’s slightly more intuitive if you imagine the value attached to the up-down control as controlling the <i>y</i>-coordinate of an imaginary object on the screen. In that case, clicking the up-arrow causes the <i>y</i>-coordinate to decrease and the object moves up the screen.) </p>
<p> Fortunately, this wackiness doesn’t last long, because the moment you change the range of the up-down control from the (not very useful) default of 0–100 to whatever you actually need, the arrows behave “normally” again. </p>
<p> Perhaps intuitiveness should have won out over logic. But what’s done is done, and, as noted above, the problem goes away soon enough. </p>
