<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What was Dr. Watson’s original name?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p><p>
What most people probably don’t know is that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449866.aspx">
Dr. Watson’s name</a>
wasn’t originally “Dr. Watson”.
</p>
<p>
The original name of the diagnostic tool was “Sherlock”,
whose icon was a lit drop-stem pipe.
I remember chatting about the Doctor with its author,
<a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2970862&amp;date=19990709">
the late Don Corbitt</a>, whose office was just a few doors down from mine.
In 1991, he had to change the name from “Sherlock” to “Dr. Watson”;
I had forgotten why, but
<a href="https://dglasser.wordpress.com/">
Danny Glasser</a> came to my rescue
and reminded me that there was already a debugging tool called
“Sherlock” that had come out a few years previously.
The name had to change,
and the Doctor stepped in to fill Sherlock’s shoes.
The icon was originally a doctor’s bag, but it changed to the
stethoscope-wielding general practitioner a few months later.

A note about Don Corbitt.
He was a tall fellow with a deep booming voice,
but he never used it.
Instead, he spoke in a gentle, reassuring tone,
backing it up with code that was always solid.
I consider it an honor to have worked with him.
Taking up the mantle of keeping the Doctor up to date with the
latest forensic techniques,
I updated it (i.e., rewrote it from scratch) for
Windows 98.
I was not a member of the Windows 98 team but wrote
the program as a favor to them at great personal cost.
(My then-boss didn’t approve of my little side project
and made his displeasure known at my next performance review.)
