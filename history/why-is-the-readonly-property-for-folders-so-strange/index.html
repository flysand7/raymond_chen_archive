<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why is the readonly property for folders so strange?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s actually a signal to Explorer to look harder. It doesn’t mean that the directory is read-only.</p>
<p>If a folder has the Read-Only or System flag set, then Explorer will look for a <code>desktop.ini</code> file which describes the folder customizations. For performance reasons, Explorer does this only if the directory has the +R or +S flag. (This is enormously important on slow networks.)</p>
<p>There are two KB articles on this subject, and I will defer to them for much of the discussion. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US">This is the version that applies to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003</a>. There is also <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US">a version that applies to older versions of Windows</a>, although the <code>UseSystemForSystemFolders</code> policy still applies.</p>
<p>Coders should use the function <code>PathMakeSystemFolder</code> to mark a folder as requiring special attention from Explorer.</p>
