<p>In 32-bit Windows, timer IDs and dialog control IDs are 32-bit values, but in 64-bit windows, timer IDs and dialog control IDs are 64-bit values. Seriously? Did you really expect people to create more than 4 billion timers or dialog controls?</p>
<p>No, that’s not why they are 64-bit values.</p>
<p>Values were expanded from 32-bit values to 64-bit values whenever they could be used to store a pointer, because pointers on 64-bit Windows are 64 bits in size.</p>
<p>Sometimes this was obvious, like the message <code>WPARAM</code> and <code>LPARAM</code>, which are often window handles or pointers to supplementary structures. Or values used as reference data for callbacks, since a common pattern is to use a pointer to a helper structure in order to pass a large amount of information. The <code>GWLP_</code><code>USER­DATA</code> storage that comes with every window is another place where it is common practice to store a pointer.</p>
<p>We saw last time that <a href="/code/a-window-can-t-have-two-timers-with-the-same-id-so-how-do-i-assign-an-id-that-nobody-else-is-using"> a common convention is to use pointers to assign unique IDs</a>, particularly for timers, and that meant that timer IDs needed to be expanded from 32-bit values to 64-bit values.</p>
<p>Dialog controls are stored in the <code>GWL_ID</code> window data. Why was this expanded to a 64-bit value <code>GWLP_ID</code>? You can’t actually use a 64-bit dialog control ID because the <code>GetDlgCtrlID</code> function returns a 32-bit integer, and window messages that use the dialog control ID (such as <code>WM_</code><code>COMMAND</code>) have only a 16-bit field for the dialog control ID. So it seems that there’s no point in expanding the dialog control ID to a 64-bit value, since nobody actually reports it as a 64-bit value.</p>
<p>While it’s true that nobody reports it as a 64-bit value, you can still retrieve the full 64-bit value by asking for the <code>GWLP_ID</code>.</p>
<p>Pointers are like weeds. Anywhere it’s possible to fit a pointer, a pointer will try to squeeze in there.</p>
<p>Since it was possible in 32-bit Windows to store a 32-bit value in the place that holds the dialog control ID, people used it to store a pointer because <i>hey, look, free pointer-sized memory</i>. They never intended to use it as a dialog control ID, but if somebody’s going to give you free memory, why not use it!</p>
<p>This creative use of the dialog control ID were discovered during the development of 64-bit Windows, and the dialog control ID storage was expanded to a 64-bit value to accommodate it.</p>
