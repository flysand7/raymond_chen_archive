<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Bad version number checks</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Version numbers. Very important. And so many people check them wrong.</p>
<p>
This is why Windows 95’s GetVersion function returned 3.95 instead of 4.0.
A lot of code checked the version number like this:
</p>
<pre>
  UINT Ver = GetVersion();
  UINT MajorVersion = LOBYTE(uVer);
  UINT MinorVersion = HIBYTE(uVer);
  if (MajorVersion &lt; 3 || MinorVersion &lt; 10) {
   Error("This program requires Windows 3.1");
  }
</pre>
<p>
Now consider what happens when the version number is reported
as 4.0.  The major version check passes, but the minor version
check fails since 0 is less than 10.
</p>
<p>
This bug was so rife that we gave up shimming every app that
had the problem and just decided, “Fine. If anybody asks,
say that the Windows version is 3.95.”
</p>
<p>
I suspect this is also
<a href="/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/22/61647.aspx#61840">
why DirectX always reports its version as 4.x</a>.</p>
