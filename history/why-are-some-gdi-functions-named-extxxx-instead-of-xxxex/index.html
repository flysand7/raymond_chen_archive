<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are some GDI functions named ExtXxx instead of XxxEx?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>By convention, an enhanced version of a function <code>Xxx</code> is called <code>XxxEx</code>, but there are many GDI functions that don’t follow this conventions, most notably <code>ExtTextOut</code>, which should have been named <code>TextOutEx</code> under the <code>XxxEx</code> convention. Why don’t the GDI functions follow that convention?
 Because they were named before the <code>XxxEx</code> convention was established.</p>
<p> Nothing nefarious, just an artifact of history. </p>
