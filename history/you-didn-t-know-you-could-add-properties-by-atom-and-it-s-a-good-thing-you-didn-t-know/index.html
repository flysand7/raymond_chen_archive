<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You didn't know you could add properties by atom, and it's a good thing you didn't know</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
As I noted a few days ago,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/30/8440201.aspx">
there is weirdness associated with properties added by atom</a>.
This weirdness stems from the fact that adding properties by atom
is really a hole in the original implementation
rather than something designed on purpose.
</p>
<p>
The original 16-bit code for adding and removing properties went
roughly like this:
</p>
<pre>
BOOL SetProp(HWND hwnd, LPSTR pszName, HANDLE hValue)
{
    ... let's look only at the part that adds a new property ...
    ATOM atm = HIWORD(pszName) ? GlobalAddAtom(pszName) : LOWORD(pszName);
    if (atm == 0) return FALSE;
    ... add the atom "atm" to the property list ...
}
HANDLE RemoveProp(HWND hwnd, LPSTR pszName)
{
    ATOM atm = HIWORD(pszName) ? GlobalFindAtom(pszName) : LOWORD(pszName);
    if (atm == 0) return NULL;
    ... look for the atom "atm" in the property list and remove it ...
    if (!found) return NULL;
    // clean up the atom
    if (HIWORD(pszName)) GlobalDeleteAtom(atm);
}
void CleanPropertiesWhenWindowIsDestroyed(HWND hwnd)
{
    for (each property on the window) {
        if (atm &gt;= MAXINTATOM) GlobalDeleteAtom(atm);
    }
    .. delete memory used for recording properties ...
}
</pre>
<p>
First, let’s look at properties set and removed via integer atoms.
These are simple:
When setting the property, we just add it to the property list,
and when removing the property, we remove it.
Nothing fancy going on here.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, there’s nothing particularly exciting going on if a property
is set and removed by name.
When setting the property, we use <code>GlobalAddAtom</code> to convert
the string to an atom (incrementing the reference count),
and when removing it, we use <code>GlobalDeleteAtom</code>
to clean it up (decrementing the reference count and removing the atom
if the reference count goes to zero).
</p>
<p>
Finally, when a window is destroyed with outstanding properties,
we clean them up by calling <code>GlobalDeleteAtom</code> on all
the string atoms, counteracting the <code>GlobalAddAtom</code> we
performed when we added the property.
</p>
<p>
So what’s the big deal? Looks great, right?
</p>
<p>
See if you can find the hole in this implementation.

Hint 1:
There are actually <i>three</i> ways of adding and removing properties
from a window,
not the two I led you to believe.
&lt;!–
You can use an integer atom (one whose numerical value is less than
<code>MAXINTATOM</code>),
you can use a string atom (an atom whose numerical value is between
<code>MAXINTATOM</code> and <code>0xFFFF</code>),
or you can use a string.
–&gt;
</p>
<p>
Hint 2:
What happens if you mix and match these three methods?
</p>
<p>
Hint 3:
What happens to each of the three types of properties when the
window manager is forced to clean them up?
</p>
<p>
These problems with properties were fixed a long time ago,
but old-timers remain wary of adding named properties by string atom.
It’s one of those
