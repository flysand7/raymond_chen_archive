<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hardware backwards compatibility</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>         Backwards compatibility applies not only to software. It also applies to hardware.         And when hardware goes bad, the software usually takes the blame.      </p>
<p>         The HLT instruction tells the CPU to shut itself down until the next hardware interrupt.         This is a big win on laptops since it reduces power consumption and thereby saves         your lap from third-degree burns.      </p>
<p>         We (well, specifically, Jeff) had this implemented and working in Windows 95 but discovered         to our dismay that there were many laptops (some from a major manufacturer) which         would lock up unrecoverably if you issued a HLT instruction.      </p>
<p>         So we had to back it out.      </p>
<p>         Then the aftermarket HLT programs came out and people wrote, “Stupid Microsoft. Why         did they leave this feature out of Windows.” I had to sit quietly while people accused         Microsoft of being stupid and/or lazy and/or selfish.      </p>
<p>         But now the statute of limitations has expired so at least I can say something (though         I’m still not going to name that major manufacturer, nice try).      </p>
<p>         My favorite bad hardware, though, was a system which would crash if the video card         was put in an expansion slot too far away from the power supply. Manufacturers will         do anything to save a nickel.      </p>
<p>         And yet Windows 95 ran on almost all of this bad hardware. Why did we go to all this         effort to accomodate bad hardware? Consider:      </p>
<ul>
<li>             You have a computer that works okay.          </li>
<li>             You go to the store and buy Windows 95.          </li>
<li>             You take it home and install it.          </li>
<li>             Your computer crashes.          </li>
</ul>
<p>         Whom do you blame? Hint: Not your computer manufacturer.      </p>
<p>         I have more hardware stories, but I have a meeting soon so I’ll have to stop here         for today.      </p>
