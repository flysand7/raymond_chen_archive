<p> <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1868435,00.asp"> PC Magazine interviewed “the team behind Windows” in commemoration of Windows’ twentieth birthday</a>. The article’s author talked with Bill Gates, Charles Simonyi, Jeff Raikes, Ray Ozzie (huh? He didn’t even work at Microsoft until April 2005! How could he have been part of “the team behind Windows”?), Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, David Cole, Yusuf Mehdi, Joe Belfiore, and Chris Jones. Ten managers. Apparently “the team behind Windows” doesn’t include programmers or testers. </p>
<p> For some reason, the media often identify Hillel Cooperman (a Product Unit Manager) <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5098860.html"> as a programmer</a>, and whenever this happens, we always make a point to assign him a nasty bug to fix. </p>
