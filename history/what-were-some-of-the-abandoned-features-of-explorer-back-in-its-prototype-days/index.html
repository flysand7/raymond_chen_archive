<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What were some of the abandoned features of Explorer back in its prototype days?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Chris asked for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040328"> some stories about what Explorer was like in the early days</a>.
 Well, one thing is that the original name of Explorer was <i>Cabinet</i>, continuing the folder/document metaphor by taking all your folders and documents and putting them inside a virtual <i>filing cabinet</i>. (Cabinet was viewed as an update to the Windows 3.1 File Manager program, whose icon as we all know was a filing cabinet.) Some remnants of this old name can be found in places like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773207.aspx"> the <code>CABINETSTATE</code> structure</a>. (Note that this old sense of Cabinet is unrelated to the CAB file format, which is also called Cabinet.)
 In the early versions of Cabinet, shortcuts were indicated not by a little arrow overlay but by appending &gt;&gt; to the end of the name. For example, you might see an icon on the desktop called <i>My Computer&gt;&gt;</i>.
 The first icon in each folder was a special icon that consisted of an upward-pointing arrow with the name <i>Up One Folder</i>. This was really just a leaky abstraction, exposing the <code>..</code> directory entry as if it were a real directory.</p>
<p> We saw what the original Start menu and taskbar looked like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx"> some time ago</a>, back before it was a taskbar, and also saw <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/22/54559.aspx"> the precursor to the Start menu</a>. </p>
