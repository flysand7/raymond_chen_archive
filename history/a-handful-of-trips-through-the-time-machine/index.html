<p> A few trips through the time machine: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/24-years-of-windows-package-design-643034">     24 years of Windows package design</a>. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-retrospective-boot-screens-through-the-ages-642928">     Boot screens through the ages</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20110325/microsofts-future-of-productivity-showcases-19-years-evolution-information-technology/">     Microsoft producivity applications through the decades</a>.     (Warning: Marketing video.)     Many of the locations in the first part of     that video are from Microsoft’s main campus.     The ones I recognized are     the brown building that opens the video,     the cubicle at 0:12 (spot the anachronism),     the office at 0:20,     the bookshelf at 0:21,     the hallway at 0:28,     the mailroom at 0:29,     and     the new bookshelf at 0:41.     But once he makes it to IT Director,     they move to some fancy-dancy building,     which Long Zheng identifies as the City Center Plaza building     in Bellevue. </li>
<li> <a href="http://rasteri.blogspot.com/2011/03/chain-of-fools-upgrading-through-every.html">     Upgrading through every version of Windows</a>     starting from MS-DOS 5.0. </li>
<li> <a href="http://rasteri.blogspot.com/2011/03/we-are-ie-comparing-every-version-of.html">     Comparing every version of Internet Explorer</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> In the Internet Explorer time machine video, I was struck by the remark, “Appearance-wise, very little had changed [in Internet Explorer 4] since IE3. Not much changed in terms of functionality, either.” In fact, Internet Explorer 4 was probably the most significant revision of Internet Explorer in its history, because that’s the version that completely replaced the old layout engine with a new one code-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)"> Trident</a>, the layout engine that continues to power Internet Explorer today. Another case of “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/25/141253.aspx">When you change the insides, nobody notices</a>.” </p>
