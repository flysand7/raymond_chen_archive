<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Outlook map Ctrl+F to Forward instead of Find, like all right-thinking programs?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s a widespread convention that the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> keyboard shortcut initiates a Find operation. Word does it, Excel does it, Wordpad does it, Notepad does it, Internet Explorer does it. But Outlook doesn’t. Why doesn’t Outlook get with the program?</p>
<p>Rewind to 1995.</p>
<p>The mail team was hard at work on their mail client, known as Exchange (code name Capone, in keeping with all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95"> Chicago</a>-related code names from that era). Back in those days, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> keyboard shortcut did indeed call up the Find dialog, in accordance with convention.</p>
<p>And then a bug report came in from a beta tester who wanted <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to forward rather than find, because he had become accustomed to that keyboard shortcut from the email program he used before Exchange.</p>
<p>That beta tester was Bill Gates.</p>
