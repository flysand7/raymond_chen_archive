<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is the format for FirstInstallDateTime on Windows 95?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Public Service Announcement: Daylight Saving Time ends in most parts of the United States this weekend.</p>
<p>Windows 98/98/Me recorded the date and time at which Setup was run in the registry under <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<wbr/>Software\<wbr/>Microsoft\<wbr/>Windows\<wbr/>CurrentVersion</code> as a binary value named <code>FirstInstallDateTime</code>. What is the format of this data?</p>
<p>Take the binary value and treat it as a 32-bit little-endian value. The format of the value is basically <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/05/54806.aspx"> DOS date/time format</a>, except that the seconds are always 0 or 1 (usually 1), due to a programming error.</p>
<p>Exercise: What error would result in the seconds always being 0 or 1 (usually 1)?</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: MrZebra guessed that the code did a logical OR instead of a bitwise OR:</p>
<pre>wSeconds = actualSeconds || 0;
</pre>
<p>But it’s not clear why anybody would be writing <code>actualSeconds | 0</code> in the first place.</p>
<p>Felix Kasza observed that the “seconds” field is the number of 2-second intervals, and guessed that somebody used the wrong arithmetic operator:</p>
<pre>wSeconds = actualSeconds % 2; // should be "actualSeconds / 2"
</pre>
<p>That would explain why the value is always 0 or 1, but not why 1 predominates. The above mistake would result in the values 0 and 1 being used about evenly.</p>
<p>Falcon guessed that somebody wrote</p>
<pre>wSeconds = actualSeconds &amp;&amp; 0x3F; // should be "actualSeconds &amp; 0x3F"
</pre>
<p>While this matches the “0 or 1, usually 1” results, it’s not clear why somebody would be taking the actual seconds and logical-AND’ing it with <code>0x3F</code> in the first place. The actual seconds is already in the range 0 to 59. There’s no need to mask out the high bits; they are already zero.</p>
<p>Falcon tried again, and got the correct answer this time:</p>
<pre>wSeconds = actualSeconds &gt; 1; // should be "actualSeconds &gt;&gt; 1"
</pre>
<p>The code wanted to divide the number of seconds by 2 by using the right-shift operator, but forgetting to double the greater-than sign resulted in it being an arithmetic comparison, and the number of seconds is greater than one 96% of the time.</p>
