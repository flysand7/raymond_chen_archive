<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Suggestion Box 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Post suggestions for future topics here instead of posting off-topic comments. Note that the suggestion box is emptied and read periodically so don’t be surprised if your suggestion vanishes. (Note also that I am under no obligation to accept any suggestion.)</p>
<p>Topics I are more inclined to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows history (particularly the Windows 95 era). </li>
<li>Windows user interface programming in Win32, and shell programming in particular. </li>
<li>General programming topics (selectively). </li>
<li>Issues of general interest. </li>
<li>My personal hobbies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics I am not inclined to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blog software itself.  You can send feedback about .Text to its author, <a href="http://scottwater.com/blog/">Scott Watermasysk</a>. </li>
<li>Internet Explorer. You can try <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ie">the IE folks</a>. </li>
<li>Visual Studio.  You can try one of the Visual Studio blogs. </li>
<li>Managed code. This is not a .NET blog. I do not work on .NET technologies. As far as .NET is concerned, I’m just another programmer like you. Occasionally I touch a .NET-related topic, but I do not bring any expertise to the subject. </li>
<li>Non-software Microsoft topics, such as product support policies, marketing tactics, and hiring policy. </li>
<li>Microsoft software that isn’t Windows. (Exchange, Office, …) </li>
<li>Windows topics outside user interface programming. (Plug and Play, Terminal Services, Windows Messenger, Outlook Express, SQL, IIS, remoting, SOA…) </li>
<li>User interface programming in anything other than Win32. (Because I know nothing about it.) </li>
<li>Debugging a specific problem. (Not of general interest.) </li>
<li>Legal issues. </li>
<li>Predictions for the future. (What’s the title of this blog again?)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Due to the way the blog server is set up, a new suggestion box gets set up every 30 days, assuming I don’t forget to create a new one. If I forget, you can send me a reminder via the Contact page. You can also peek at <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/articles/166545.aspx">the previous suggestion box</a>.)</p>
