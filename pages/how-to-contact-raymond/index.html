<p>If your subject matter is a suggestion for a future topic, please  post it to the Suggestion Box (using the Suggestion Box link on the  side of the page). If you send it to me directly, I will probably lose  track of it.</p>
<p>  If your subject matter is personal (for example “Hi, Raymond,  remember me? We went to the same high school…”), you can send email  using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/contact.aspx">Contact</a> page. (Update 25 March 2007: The contact page has been disabled because over 90% of the messages that arrive are spam.)  </p>
<p>  I do not promise to respond to your message.  </p>
<p>  If you are making a suggestion for a future version of a Microsoft product, <a href="http://register.microsoft.com/mswish/suggestion.asp">submit it directly to Microsoft</a> rather than sending it to me, because I won’t know what to do with it either.  </p>
<p>  I do not provide one-on-one technical support.  If your question is of general interest, you can post it to the Suggestion Box.  If you are looking for technical support, there are a variety of options available, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx">newgroups</a>, <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">bulletin boards</a>, <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/">forums (fora?)</a>, and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/">Microsoft’s own product support web site</a>.  </p>
