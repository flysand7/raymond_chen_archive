<p>I was riding in a car with a friend when <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com.tw/f_album.php?al_prodno=SDD0408"> a Chinese pop album</a> spun up on the CD. I made a remark about the song, and my friend, knowing that I was studying Mandarin, asked me, “Do you know what she’s singing about?”
 I immediately replied, “She’s singing about love.”
 “Wow,” my friend responded. “Your Chinese is quite good.”
 “Nope,” I said. “But all pop songs are about love.”</p>
<p> If somebody asks you what a pop song is about, you can answer “love”, and you’ve got a very high chance of being correct. </p>
