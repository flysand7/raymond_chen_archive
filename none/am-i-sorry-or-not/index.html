<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Am I sorry or not?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> One of the consequences of the New Internet World Order is that it is very easy to set up a web site like <a href="http://www.sorryeverybody.com/">www.sorryeverybody.com</a> and equally easy to set up a response like <a href="http://www.notsorryeverybody.com/"> www.notsorryeverybody.com</a>. This state of affairs clearly calls out for some sort of competition between the two. At dinner last night, someone suggested that there should be a site like <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Contests__Surveys__and_Polls/Polls/X_or_Not_/">www.amisorryornot.com</a>? I guess it would have been funnier if the “not sorry” site had pictures of people not being sorry. Then “sorry or not” could have picked a picture and had visitors vote whether the person looked sorry or not… </p>
<p> (I have to admit in my consummate geekdom that I think that the funniest “X or not” site is <a href="http://www.amibiosornot.com/"> www.amibiosornot.com</a>.) </p>
