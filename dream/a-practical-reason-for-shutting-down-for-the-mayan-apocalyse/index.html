<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A practical reason for shutting down for the Mayan apocalyse</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that Costco announced that they were closing for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayan_apocalypse"> Mayan apocalypse</a> and would reopen two weeks later. Not because they believed in it. Rather, because that was their estimate as to how long it would take people to get through their stockpiles and be ready to go shopping again. </p>
<p> Curiously, I had this dream several weeks <i>after</i> the apocalypse date had passed. </p>
