<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Old trace logs in your dreams</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that I was archiving old data. Some came off an old CP/M floppy disc. Another was an IntelliTrace debug log from the 1980’s. Back then, IntelliTrace recorded the history onto index cards, which were stored in trays like in a library card catalog. Made jumping back and forth really easy, but setting breakpoints was a pain.</p>
