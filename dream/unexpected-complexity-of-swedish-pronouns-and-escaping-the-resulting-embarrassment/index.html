<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Unexpected complexity of Swedish pronouns, and escaping the resulting embarrassment</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that Swedish had separate third-person-plural pronouns based on gender. They were formed from <i>han</i> and <i>hon</i> by adding a common suffix, but the pattern broke down for <i>det</i>, and I got stuck trying to finish a sentence without knowing the correct word. </p>
<p> I was able to escape from this embarrassing situation by using a technique available only in dreams: I woke up. </p>
