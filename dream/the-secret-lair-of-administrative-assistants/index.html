<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The secret lair of Administrative Assistants</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that a colleague and I were looking for a copy of a TN3270 emulator in order to investigate a bug. The search took us into an abandoned-looking Building 5. But upon entering, we discovered that Building 5 was actually the secret lair of all the Administrative Assistants. </p>
<p> Oh, and we eventually found the bug in TN3270. It was an application bug that caused it to leave the laser on for too long in one spot, causing it to burn your thumb. </p>
