<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">That doesn't sound like South Frisian to me</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that I was back in college taking a course in South Frisian, but I suspected something was up because the words didn’t sound Germanic at all, and we were taught the words to a Christmas carol as <i>Nom Yom Hear What I Hear?</i> </p>
<p> Also, because the course was taught by <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2008/02/17/Southpinellas/TV_chef_spiced_up_his.shtml"> known prevaricator/exaggerator Robert Irvine</a>. </p>
