<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Let me take this shortcut across Lake Saskatchewan</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I dreamed that I had to drive from Los Angeles to Berkeley to catch my flight home. To do this, I used a product from a local startup company: A computerized map of the Bay Area.</p>
<p> There were two routes across Lake Saskatchewan. The southern route is highway I-70, and the northern route is an elevated highway that goes right past the head of the Canadian Statue of Freedom, a 300-foot-tall statue carved from a single rock. This shows that computer nerds are horrible cartographers:  Berkeley has an airport, Los Angeles is on the peninsula just south of San Francisco, and the Bay Area is in Canada. </p>
<p> Sure, this is an absurd dream, but you gotta admit, that shortcut across Lake Saskatchewan would be pretty awesome. </p>
