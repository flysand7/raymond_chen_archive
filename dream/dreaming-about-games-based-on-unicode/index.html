<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Dreaming about games based on Unicode</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I dreamed that two of my colleagues were playing a game based on pantomiming Unicode code points. One of them got LOW QUOTATION MARK, and the other got a variety of ARROW POINTING NORTHEAST, ARROW POINTING EAST, ARROW POINTING SOUTHWEST. </p>
<p> I wonder how you would pantomime ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER. </p>
