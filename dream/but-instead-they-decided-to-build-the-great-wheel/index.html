<p> I dreamed that Seattle was building its own version of the Eiffel Tower. Just like the original, except that it was also a thrill ride similar to <a href="http://www.ride-extravaganza.com/intermediate/roundup/"> Round Up</a> but you are seated. </p>
<p> It turns out that the city of Seattle accepted my subconscious’s instructions to replicate another city’s famous landmark, but the message wasn’t received loud and clear. Instead of making an Eiffel Tower knock-off, we decided to make <a href="http://seattlegreatwheel.com/"> a London Eye knock-off</a>. </p>
