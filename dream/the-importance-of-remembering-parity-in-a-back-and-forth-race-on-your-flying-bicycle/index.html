<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The importance of remembering parity in a back-and-forth race on your flying bicycle</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I dreamed that one of my friends had made the U.S. cycling team. (Perhaps because everybody else got busted for doping.) Even more implausibly, <i>I</i> also made the team.</p>
<p> To celebrate, he challenged me to a short race. The path ran along a river, in which a medium-sized boat was setting sail. Our bicycles somehow could fly (which we considered perfectly normal) and we were flying over the boat, just about keeping pace with it. </p>
<p> The boat reversed direction many times, and we reversed along with it. At one of the reversals, I thought, “I could take a shortcut if I kept going straight,” but I must’ve lost even/odd count because I flew off the boat… heading back to the starting line. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus weirdness</b>: For some reason, we were in Sweden, and the race commentator saw a school labeled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)"> Gymnasium</a> and made some remark about repurposing buildings left over from the Olympics. </p>
