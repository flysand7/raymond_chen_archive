<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Derive the age of the planet Jupiter from the properties of liquid hydrogen and the planet’s surface temperature</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I dreamed that my homework assignment was to derive the age of the planet Jupiter. The professor hinted that physical properties of liquid hydrogen and the current Jupiter surface temperature would be useful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebunn/"> My classmate Ted</a>, on the other hand, had to extend a C++ base class to record a GUID name. </p>
<p> The two of us were taking a class together where we watched a reality show about two ditzy celebrities, and the professor said, “The next episode is so stupid, I don’t even want anybody to watch it. But they do learn about Sirens of Greek mythology, so can you guys write up a quick one-pager to get everybody up to speed?” </p>
<p> That’s how I ended up dreaming that Ted and I had to write a one-page overview of Greek Sirens. </p>
