<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">State law requires you to watch this video of a singing hippo</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/18/9771136.aspx"> did it briefly a few years ago</a>, but I’m going to make it a regular Monday feature, at least for this year: Blogging my dreams. </p>
<p> I dreamed that I was back in my high school English class, and due to some new state law, everybody was required to watch this video of a singing hippo. The hard part was walking four miles to the nearest viewing location, seeing as we didn’t even have a TCP/IP standard yet, much less YouTube. </p>
<p> To think that this is the culmination of the technological advances of the last three decades: Being able to watch a singing hippo on demand. </p>
