<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">It really wasn't that fancy a Swedish sentence</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I dreamed that I was on vacation with my family at a cabin in the woods. I went downstairs with my elder child, and in the playroom I saw another family who are good friends of ours. I guess they chose to vacation at the same place.
 They had hired a Swedish-speaking nanny to help with the kids. The nanny asked me a simple question, and I gave a straightforward answer. “Hon är den äldre av mina två barn.”
 The nanny was all so impressed that I was using like super-fancy-pants Swedish grammar.</p>
<p> Spoiler alert: It isn’t particularly fancy. </p>
