<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you had to deal with preschoolers all day, you'd need a nap too</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Today, I’m turning it around: This is a dream that one of my friends had about <i>me</i>! </p>
<p> She dreamed that she took her camera to school to take some pictures, possibly for the yearbook. She was somewhat surprised to discover that I was the new preschool teacher. When she popped in to my classroom to get a couple of pictures of me, she wasn’t able to take any: Apparently, my new position was so exhausting that I’d had to take a nap on the king-size classroom bed… </p>
