<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Email tip: Don't add people to a thread without saying why</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you add me to an existing discussion, you have to say why. Do you have a specific question for me? Do you want my opinion on something? Are you just sharing a funny joke?
 Sometimes, I’ll get a piece of mail that goes like this:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b>From</b>: Xxxxx<br/> <b>To</b>: Aaaaa; Bbbbb; Ccccc; Raymond<br/>  Adding Raymond. </p>
<p> — Original Message —<br/> … </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Gee, that’s very nice of you to add me, but you didn’t say why. Is this a FYI? Is there a question you want answered? Often, the discussion is just “Gosh, there’s this bug, person A proposes a theory, person B proposes a counter-theory, person C runs some tests and has some preliminary results, <b>adding Raymond</b>.”
 It’s like “Adding Raymond” is a ritual phrase people sprinkle into a mail thread. They don’t know what’ll happen when they say it, they don’t even have any expectations, but it doesn’t hurt to say it, right? “When in doubt, add Raymond.”</p>
<p> If you don’t explain why you added me to a thread, I’m just going to killfile it. </p>
