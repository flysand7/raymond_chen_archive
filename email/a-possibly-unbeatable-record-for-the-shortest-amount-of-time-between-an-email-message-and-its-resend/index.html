<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">A possibly unbeatable record for the shortest amount of time between an email message and its resend</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I occasionally bring up the issue of people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/13/2106139.aspx"> ask a question and then repeat the question</a>, especially people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/18/8745271.aspx"> repeat the question with some impatience</a>. At the time, the record for the shortest time between the message and its repeat was eight minutes.
 But I think I have something unbeatable.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>From</b>: X<br/> <b>To</b>: ABC Team </p>
<p> I hit this crash in ABC. Can somebody take a look at it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A half hour later, somebody replied:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>From</b>: A<br/> <b>To</b>: X, ABC Team </p>
<p> This looks like the problem is really in the DEF component. You should have the DEF team look at it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Person X waited a few hours, then got impatient.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>From</b>: X<br/> <b>To</b>: DEF Team </p>
<p> Any update on the attached issue? <span style="font-size: 200%">✉</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Notice that person X’s request for an update was the <i>initial contact</i> with the DEF team. One way of looking at this was that the time between the message and its resend was zero seconds. The only way to beat this, I guess, is to send the repeat message <i>before</i> sending the original.</p>
<p> But if you look at it another way, this is in fact unbeatable: Since there was no earlier message, the time between the message and its resend is actually NaN. </p>
