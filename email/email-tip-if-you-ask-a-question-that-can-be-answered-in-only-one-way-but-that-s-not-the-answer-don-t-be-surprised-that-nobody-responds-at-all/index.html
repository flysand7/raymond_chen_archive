<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Email tip: If you ask a question that can be answered in only one way, but that’s not the answer, don’t be surprised that nobody responds at all</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It’s not infrequent that I see somebody ask a question that can be answered in only one way. But if that’s not the answer, then nobody will respond.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Is there a module that does XYZ? </p></blockquote>
<p> This question can be answered in only one way: “Yes, here it is.” If nobody has written such a module, nobody is going to reply saying, “No, nobody has written the module you request,” because that would require the responder to prove a negative. </p>
<p> “I have scoured the entire planet, including code sitting on a hard drive in somebody’s mother’s basement, and have verified that there is no module that does XYZ. Furthermore, I have altered the rules of the universe to ensure that nobody will write such a module in the time between I completed this investigation and the time you receive this message.” </p>
<p> If you ask a question asking whether something exists, there’s only one possible response, because nobody is going to say that the code you request has never been written. </p>
<p> So far, nothing is wrong. Perhaps the person who asked the question was about to write an XYZ module, but wanted to make sure the effort was not being duplicated. </p>
<p> However, there are some people who fail to realize that they just asked for proof of a negative, and send a follow-up: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Resending. Can somebody please tell me whether this module exists? </p></blockquote>
<p> What’s particularly scary are the people who ask the question in such a way that they are not only asking for proof of a negative, but in fact proof of a <i>perpetual</i> negative. There was one customer who was rather insistent upon receiving an answer to a question of the form “Will there ever be a tool that will…?” </p>
<p> And once again, the round-up of unhelpful or rude subject lines I’ve seen in the past five months: </p>
