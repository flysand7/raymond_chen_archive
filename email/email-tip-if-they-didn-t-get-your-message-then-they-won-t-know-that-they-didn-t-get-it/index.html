<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Email tip: If they didn't get your message, then they won't know that they didn't get it</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I illustrate this point with a conversation that actually happened:
 Person 1: “Did you get my email?”
 Person 2: “Which one?”</p>
<p> Person 1: “The last one.” </p>
