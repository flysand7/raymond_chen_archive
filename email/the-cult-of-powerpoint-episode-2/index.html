<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The cult of PowerPoint, episode 2</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>PowerPoint is a fine presentation tool, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/22/45301.aspx"> some people have elevated it to the level of a cult</a>. The most recent member of the PowerPoint cult was a customer who decided to use PowerPoint in an email message.</p>
<p> No, I don’t mean that the customer attached a bad PowerPoint presentation to the email. I mean that the customer’s email was itself a three-slide PowerPoint presentation. </p>
<p> Well, not quite. </p>
<p> What they actually did was create a three-slide presentation, then take screenshots of each slide and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/19/8877486.aspx"> embed them in the email</a>. </p>
<p> Well, not quite. </p>
<p> The screenshots were shrunk to save size. Each page from the PowerPoint presentation contained about 50 words of text. Which were very hard to read because the screenshots were shrunk. </p>
<p> The PowerPoint presentation itself was a shortened form of your typical boring PowerPoint slide presentation. The first slide was an introduction to the program they were using. The second slide was a statement of the problem they were having. The third slide was a call to action for Microsoft to assist in determining why the program was having the problem. </p>
<p> Thank goodness it didn’t have a concluding “Any questions?” slide. </p>
