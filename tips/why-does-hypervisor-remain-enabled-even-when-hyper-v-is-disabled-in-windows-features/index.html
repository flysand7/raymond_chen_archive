<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does hypervisor remain enabled even when Hyper-V is disabled in Windows Features?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer found that even though they set <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/keithcombs/2009/12/08/hypervisorlaunchtype-not-set-after-bcd-changes-here-is-the-fix/">the hypervisorlaunchtype to <i>off</i> in the boot configuration</a>, and they unchecked <i>Hyper-V</i> in the <i>Turn Windows features on or off</i> dialog, they found that hypervisor was still enabled. As a result, Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager refuses to create a 64-bit guest. </p>
<p>Someone from the kernel team explained that the hypervisor might still be enabled in the UEFI, so that’s one thing to check. </p>
<p>Another thing that will force the hypervisor on is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs">Virtualization-Based Security</a>, which goes by the acronym VBS. This is confusing because to most people VBS stands for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t0aew7h6(v=vs.84).aspx">VBScript</a>. </p>
