<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The case of the volume label that doesn’t change</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer liaison forwarded a problem from their customer: When the customer changed the volume label on a drive, the change is not reflected in Explorer. Explorer continues to show the old volume label. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx">ProcMon</a> trace revealed that <code>svchost.exe</code> running as <code>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</code> attempted to open the root of the drive but got <code>STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED</code>. The access was coming from the shell hardware service at a point where it calls <code>Get­Volume­Information</code> to get the volume label. </p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense that the shell hardware service was trying to access the volume to read the volume label. After all, it was told that there was a change to the volume label, so it’s going to the volume to see what the new label is. The question is why the shell hardware service, running as <code>SYSTEM</code>, got <code>STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED</code>. </p>
<p>I asked, “How did that happen? The <code>SYSTEM</code> account should have full access to the drive by default. Did the customer apply a custom ACL that revokes <code>SYSTEM</code> access? You’ll find that a lot of things stop working when you revoke <code>SYSTEM</code> access.” </p>
<p>The customer liaison wrote back, “Indeed, the customer did remove the <code>SYSTEM</code> account from the drive’s permissions. I am not sure exactly what they were thinking when they revoked <code>SYSTEM</code> access. I need to ask them.” </p>
<p>We didn’t hear back from the customer, so maybe the customer was too embarrassed to explain why they revoked <code>SYSTEM</code> access to the drive. </p>
<p>Another case of a customer changing a security setting without really understanding why they did it, and then wondering why stuff stops working. </p>
