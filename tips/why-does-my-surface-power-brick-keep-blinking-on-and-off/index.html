<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does my Surface power brick keep blinking on and off?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you try to charge your phone and your Surface from the same power brick, keep a close eye on the charger: See if the charging light is blinking. </p>
<p>Here’s the deal. There’s an issue with some phones in the way they negotiate current with Surface power brick. The two get into a current negotiation fight. </p>
<ol>
<li>The power brick detects that there is a phone plugged in.</li>
<li>The power brick says, “Hey, I can give you 1.2mA, is that okay?”     (Note: All numbers in this story are made up.)</li>
<li>The phone says, “I’m cool with that.”</li>
<li>The power brick says, “Okay, heres 1.2mA. Enjoy.”</li>
<li>The phone gets confused and draws 1.3mA instead of 1.2mA.</li>
<li>The power brick shuts down due to overcurrent.     The charging light goes off.</li>
<li>Your Surface is now running on battery.</li>
<li>The phone says,     “Okay, well, easy come easy go.” It stops drawing power.</li>
<li>The power brick says, “Whew, that overcurrent situation is over.     I sense no load.     The user must have unplugged the curling iron or whatever it was.     Let me turn myself back on.” The charging light goes on.</li>
<li>The Surface is now running on AC power.</li>
<li>Go to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result of this issue is that the PC is constantly switching between battery and AC, and the phone doesn’t charge. Basically, everybody loses. </p>
<p>The Lumia folks issued a firmware update to address this issue, but if you’re using some other phone model, then who knows when/if it’ll get fixed. But at least you know what’s going on. </p>
