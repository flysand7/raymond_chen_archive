<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Asking for clear written documentation that “Require trusted path for credential entry” is no longer recommended</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had turned on the <i>Require trusted path for credential entry</i> policy (under Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Credential User Interface). They demanded that Microsoft provide clear written documentation that the policy is no longer recommended.</p>
<p>This was an interesting demand, because that setting was never recommended in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaron_margosis/"> Aaron Margosis</a>, who knows a lot about recommended security settings, confirmed that that setting was never in any Microsoft-published security baseline. He recalls that it was part of a draft government baseline, but was quickly removed and never made it past the draft stage. Aaron even gave a talk titled <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/SIM304"> <i>Unintended Consequences of Security Lockdowns</i></a> where he demonstrates how useless that policy is:</p>

<p>The demonstration begins at timecode 32:47, and he continues at 37:10 with a discussion of the secure attention sequence.</p>
<p>Being told that Microsoft never recommended the setting was not enough to placate the customer, who reiterated their demand that Microsoft formally publish a recommendation <i>not</i> to set that setting.</p>
<p>Faced with another case of a customer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/technet-magazine/jj643252(v=msdn.10)"> demanding that there be published documentation stating that a bad idea is a bad idea</a>, Aaron suggested that the customer consider <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/fdcc/2010/10/06/sticking-with-well-known-and-proven-solutions/"> sticking with well-known and proven solutions</a>.</p>
