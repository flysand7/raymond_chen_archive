<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's the deal with the System Volume Information folder?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In the root of every drive is a folder called “System Volume Information”.  If your drive is NTFS, the permissions on the folder are set so not even administrators can get in there. What’s the big secret? </p>
<p> The folder contains information that casual interference could cause problems with proper system functioning.  Here are some of the things kept in that folder. (This list is not comprehensive.) </p>
<ul>
<li>System Restore points.  You can disable System Restore from     the “System” control panel. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/reskit/prkc_fil_ngyp.asp">     Distributed Link Tracking Service</a> databases for repairing     your shortcuts and linked documents. </li>
<li> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/indexserv.asp">     Content Indexing Service</a> databases for fast file searches.     This is also the source of the <code>cidaemon.exe</code> process:     That is the content indexer itself, busy scanning your files and     building its database so you can search for them quickly.     (If you created a lot of data in a short time, the content indexer     service gets all excited trying to index it.) </li>
<li>Information used by the     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/XPKernel/default.aspx">     Volume Snapshot Service</a> (also known as “Volume Shadow Copy”)     so you can back up files on a live system. </li>
<li>Longhorn systems keep WinFS databases here. </li>
</ul>
