<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Start menu pin list is just a list of items; there’s no magic</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Kevin Dente asks, “<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#553256">Is it possible to put a folder on the Start Menu Pin list and have it cascade?</a>”</p>
<p> No. The last time I checked (which was back in Windows XP), the Start menu pin list was a list, not a menu. (Specifically, a list view in tile mode.) When you click on the icon, it launches. There is no code to say “Oh, if this flag is set, then let me draw a little menu arrow next to the item, and if the user clicks the arrow, bind to the target of this shortcut, enumerate its contents, and create a menu from it.” </p>
<p> Remember, <a href="http://blog.ryjones.org/2005/07/12/product-development/"> features don’t exist by default; somebody has to implement them</a>. </p>
