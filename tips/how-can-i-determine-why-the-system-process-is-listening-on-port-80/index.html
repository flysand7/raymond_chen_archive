<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I determine why the System process is listening on port 80?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer observed that the System process was listening on port 80 and couldn’t figure out why. </p>
<p>The <code>netsh http show urlacl</code> command will show which URLs have been reserved, as well as the access control lists (ACLs) associated with them. </p>
<pre>
Reserved URL : http://+:80/Temporary_Listen_Addresses/
  User: \Everyone
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;WD)

Reserved URL : http://+:80/0131501b-d67f-491b-9a40-c4bf27bcb4d4/
  User: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;NS)

Reserved URL : http://+:80/116B50EB-ECE2-41ac-8429-9F9E963361B7/
  User: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;NS)

<p>At this point, you have information you can enter into a search engine to see what they’re about. </p>
<p>The first URL is used by the Windows Communication Framework; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-replace-the-wcf-url-reservation-with-a-restricted-reservation">this web page tells you how to modify or delete it</a>. </p>
<p>The second one is assigned to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd359780.aspx">[MS-PCHC]: Peer Content Caching and Retrieval: Hosted Cache Protocol</a>, which appears to be used for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa964314(v=vs.85).aspx">subnet-level peer caching as part of Windows BranchCache</a>. </p>
<p>The third one is assigned to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd303297.aspx">[MS-PCCRR]: Peer Content Caching and Retrieval: Retrieval Protocol</a>, which also part of Windows BranchCache. </p>
<p>The customer confirmed that disabling BranchCache caused Windows to stop listening on the second and third URLs. </p>
