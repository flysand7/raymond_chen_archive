<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do network servers sometimes show up as a Recycle Bin Location?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know why some of their users showed network servers among the locations shown in the Recycle Bin property sheet.
 Answer: Because those users are using Folder Redirection.
 In particular, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc785925(WS.10).aspx"> if you redirect the My Documents folder</a>, then a network Recycle Bin location is created to hold the files deleted from My Documents.</p>
<p> The Recycle Bin folder in the user interface shows the union of all the recycled files in the individual Recycle Bin locations. </p>
