<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What do the colors in the elevation dialog mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On Windows Vista with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/uac/"> User Account Control</a> enabled, when you right-click a program and select <i>Run as Administrator</i>, the elevation prompt contains a particular snippet of warning text and a corresponding color-coding. Here are what the four colors mean.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#045082" colspan="2">     Windows needs your permission to continue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50"></td>
<td style="width: 30pc">A blue-green banner indicates that the program is a     Windows operating system component. <i>Remain calm</i>.</td>

 <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: “UAC sucks!”
 The purpose of this entry is not to discuss whether UAC is a good idea or not. I’m just trying to help by providing information on what the colors mean. This is one of the entries that I was afraid to write. On its own, it’s useful information, but I anticipate a torrent of nasty comments from people who see it as an opportunity to start flaming. I have other tips and stories related to controversial topics; this is a trial balloon entry. If I get a bad experience from this entry, I’ll delete the others. Just like how I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/01/1184734.aspx"> deleted all my stories about Bob</a>.</p>
<p> Update: Okay, just to make it clear (since I’m told that people don’t read other comments before posting their own). I did not work on UAC. If you ask me a question about its design or how it works, the answer will be “I don’t know.” That’s why I included a link to a talk from the people who actually know something about it. </p>
