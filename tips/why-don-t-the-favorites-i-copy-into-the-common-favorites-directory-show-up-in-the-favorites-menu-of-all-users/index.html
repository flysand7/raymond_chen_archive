<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why don’t the favorites I copy into the common Favorites directory show up in the Favorites menu of all users?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Favorites menu in Internet Explorer shows the user’s favorites. And stuff in the <code>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%</code> is visible to all users. Therefore, Internet shortcuts placed into the <code>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Favorites</code> directory should show up on the Favorites menu of all users, right? So why doesn’t it work?</p>
<p> Because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070609020513/blog.ryjones.org/2005/07/12/Product+Development.aspx"> features don’t exist by default</a>. </p>
<p> It’s true that there are a few highly-visible cases where the items shown to the user are a combination of files from the <code>%USERPROFILE%</code> and the <code>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%</code>, the most commonly encountered ones being the desktop and the Start menu. But that doesn’t happy as a result of magic. Somebody had to sit down and hook them up. </p>
<p> Even the highly visible cases show that the behavior is implemented on a case-by-case basis. For example, the <i>Music</i> folder does not show the items in the all-users version of the <i>Music</i> directory; there is just a shortcut that takes you there. Similarly, items in the all-users <i>Documents</i> folder do not show up in every user’s <i>Documents</i> folder; instead there is a separate <i>Shared Documents</i> folder. </p>
<p> Each of those cases had to be hooked up separately, and most of them are not hooked up at all. </p>
<p> Now, the common Favorites folder may be a tempting target, seeing as the shell team even defined a <code>CSIDL</code> value for it, but it’s just another example of something <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/25/5658731.aspx"> that never got hooked up but whose vestiges didn’t get completely cleaned up either</a>. </p>
