<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I save the results of a file search in Explorer? Not the query itself, but the results</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Say you perform a file/folder search in Explorer and you get the results. How do you save the results? That is, save the list of files that were found. </p>
<p>This is not the same as saving the query, which you can do by going to the <i>Search</i> tab and selecting 💾 <i>Save search</i>. </p>
<p>To save the results, you can select all of them, say with the ⊞ <i>Select all</i> button, and then shift-right-click on the selection and say <i>Copy as path</i>. This will put all the paths on the clipboard, and you can save them wherever you like. </p>
<p>It’s not exactly the most obvious thing, but it’s a neat trick once you know it. </p>
