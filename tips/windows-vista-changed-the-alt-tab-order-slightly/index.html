<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Windows Vista changed the Alt+Tab order slightly</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>For decades, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/20/55367.aspx"> the Alt+Tab order was the same as the Z-order</a>, but that changes in Windows Vista if you use the enhanced Alt+Tab feature known as <i>Flip</i>, which is on by default on most systems. There are three types of interactive task switching in Windows Vista:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic Alt+Tab: This is the same one that’s been around since     Windows 95.  It shows a grid of icons. </li>
<li>Flip (new for Windows Vista):     This shows a grid of thumbnails. </li>
<li>Flip3D (also new for Windows Vista):     This shows a stack of windows in 3D. </li>
</ul>
<p> Classic Alt+Tab continues to show the icons in Z-order order, but the developer who wrote Flip told me that Flip changed it up a bit based on feedback from the design team. The first several icons are still shown in Z-order order, but if you have a lot of windows open, the rest of them are shown in alphabetical order to make it easier to pick the one you want from the list. </p>
<p> I think it’s a good sign that nobody seems to have noticed. A lot of user interface work tries to be invisible. </p>
