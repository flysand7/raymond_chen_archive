<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I compress files (via NTFS compression) from the command line?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know whether there was a way to compress files and directories (in the sense of NTFS compression) from a script or from the command line. They knew about the Properties dialog, but they wanted something scriptable.
 The command-line tool for this is <code>COMPACT.EXE</code>. Type <code>compact /?</code> for usage information.
 The customer liaison was grateful for this information.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Thanks for the prompt response, and yes, this will meet our customer’s need to compress specific files such as *.docx under a particular directory and all its subdirectories. </p></blockquote>
<p> Um, *.docx files are already compressed. Compressing them again gains you nothing.</p>
