<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can’t I print when I boot Windows into audit mode?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer found that when they deployed Windows and booted into audit mode, they were unable to print anything.</p>
<p>If they were not in audit mode, then everything printed fine. It was just audit mode that was broken. They wanted to know how to print in audit mode.</p>
<p>Don’t print in audit mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/boot-windows-to-audit-mode-or-oobe"> Audit mode</a> is for you to configure your system in preparation for resealing it, so that the next boot will run through the Out of Box Experience, commonly abbreviated OOBE and pronounced /oo-bee/. You aren’t expected to be using the system as a normal user. Install the apps, make your final tweaks, and reseal that puppy.</p>
<p>Specifically, a number of services are disabled in audit mode. It’s not surprising that printing wouldn’t work.</p>
