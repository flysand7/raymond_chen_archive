<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What are the possible Status values for Win32_ComputerSystem?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190711222946/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-computersystem" title="Archived documentation: Win32_ComputerSystem class"> documentation for the Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System class</a> contains the following documentation for the Status property:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p><b>Status</b></p>
<p>Data type: <b>string</b></p>
<p>Access type: Read-only</p>
<p>Qualifiers: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/standard-qualifiers" title="Standard qualifiers"> MaxLen</a> (10), <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/standard-qualifiers" title="Standard qualifiers"> DisplayName</a> (“Status”)</p>
<p>Current status of an object. Various operational and nonoperational statuses can be defined. Operational statuses include: OK, Degraded, and Pred Fail, which is an element such as a SMART-enabled hard disk drive that may be functioning properly, but predicts a failure in the near future. Nonoperational statuses include: Error, Starting, Stopping, and Service, which can apply during mirror-resilvering of a disk, reloading a user permissions list, or other administrative work. Not all status work is online, but the managed element is not OK or in one of the other states.</p>
<p>This property is inherited from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/cim-managedsystemelement" title="CIM_ManagedSystemElement class"> <b>CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element</b></a>.</p>
<p>Values include the following:</p>
<p><b>OK</b> (“OK”)</p>
<p><b>Error</b> (“Error”)</p>
<p><b>Degraded</b> (“Degraded”)</p>
<p><b>Unknown</b> (“Unknown”)</p>
<p><b>Pred Fail</b> (“Pred Fail”)</p>
<p><b>Starting</b> (“Starting”)</p>
<p><b>Stopping</b> (“Stopping”)</p>
<p><b>Service</b> (“Service”)</p>
<p><b>Stressed</b> (“Stressed”)</p>
<p><b>NonRecover</b> (“NonRecover”)</p>

<p>What is all this gibberish trying to say? And what does it tell us about the possible Status values for a Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System?</p>
<p>Okay, first the answer, and then the discussion.</p>
<p>The answer is that the Status for a Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System is always “OK”. The computer system itself does not report any interesting status for itself, though it does report status for other things, like Front­Panel­Reset­Status</p>
<p>So why does the Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System even have a Status property if it reports nothing interesting?</p>
<p>The clue for that is in the comment that snuck in between the description and the list of status values:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>This property is inherited from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/cim-managedsystemelement" title="CIM_ManagedSystemElement class"> <b>CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element</b></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System has a Status property not because it wants to report its own status, but because it is forced to report its own status due to inheritance.</p>
<p>This also explains the rambling description: That description was also inherited from CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element. The CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element class needs to describe all of the possible managed system elements, so it has a large variety of status values available, and the documentation tries to explain what those status values mean as they could be applied to arbitrary derived classes.</p>
<p>Some reformatting and additional clarifying words might help:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Current status of an object.</p>
<p>Various operational and nonoperational statuses can be defined.</p>
<p>Operational statuses include: OK, Degraded, and Pred Fail. (Pred Fail is reported by an element such as a SMART-enabled hard disk drive that may be functioning properly, but predicts a failure in the near future.)</p>
<p>Nonoperational statuses include: Error, Starting, Stopping, and Service. (Service can be reported during mirror-resilvering of a disk, reloading a user permissions list, or other administrative work. Such work may force the element to go offline temporarily.)</p>
<p>This property is inherited from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/cim-managedsystemelement" title="CIM_ManagedSystemElement class"> <b>CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element</b></a>. Not all status values described here may apply to a derived class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But really, the description for that property should be marked as non-inherited (even though the property is inherited), and a custom description used instead:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Current status of an object.</p>
<p>For <b>Win32_<wbr/>Computer­System</b> the Status is always “OK”.</p>
<p>This property is inherited from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/cim-managedsystemelement" title="CIM_ManagedSystemElement class"> <b>CIM_<wbr/>Managed­System­Element</b></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-computersystem" title="Win32_ComputerSystem class"> what the documentation says</a> <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/win32/pull/477" title="Pull request: Clarify Win32_ComputerSystem Status"> as of last week</a>.</p>
