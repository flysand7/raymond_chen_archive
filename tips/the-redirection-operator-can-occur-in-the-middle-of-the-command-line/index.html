<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The redirection operator can occur in the middle of the command line</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Although the redirection operator traditionally appears at the end
of a command line, there is no requirement that it do so.
All of these commands are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
echo A B&gt;C
echo A&gt;C B
echo&gt;C A B
&gt;C echo A B
</pre>
<p>
All of them echo “A B” to the file “C”.
</p>
<p>
You can use this trick to avoid
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/17/599916.aspx">
the redirection problem we discussed last time</a>.
We saw that writing
</p>
<pre>
set message=Meet at 2
echo %message%&gt;schedule
</pre>
<p>
inadvertently interprets the “2” as part of the redirection operator.
One solution was to insert a space:
</p>
<pre>
echo %message% &gt;schedule
</pre>
<p>
but this assumes that the space won’t cause a problem.
If you’re in a case where that space will indeed cause a problem,
you can use the trick above to move the redirection operator
to a location where it won’t cause any trouble:
</p>
<pre>
&gt;schedule echo %message%
</pre>
