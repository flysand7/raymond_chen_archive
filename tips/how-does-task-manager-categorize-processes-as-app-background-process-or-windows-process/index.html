<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does Task Manager categorize processes as App, Background Process, or Windows Process?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you go to the Processes tab in Task Manager, you see the processes grouped into three categories: App, Background Process, and Windows Process. How does it decide which process goes into which category? </p>
<p>These are terms that Task Manager simply made up. The system itself doesn’t really care what kind of processes they are. </p>
<p>If the process has a visible window, then Task Manager calls it an “App”. </p>
<p>If the process is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn386160(v=vs.85).aspx">marked as critical</a>, then Task Manager calls it a “Windows Process”. </p>
<p>Otherwise, Task Manager calls it a “Background Process”. </p>
<p>That’s all. Nothing fancy. And completely arbitrary. </p>
