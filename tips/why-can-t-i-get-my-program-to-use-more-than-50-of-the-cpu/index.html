<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why can't I get my program to use more than 50% of the CPU?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This is sort of the reverse of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/12/02/499389.aspx"> Why is my CPU usage hovering at 50%?</a>, but the answer is the same.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When I run a CPU-intensive task, the CPU percentage used by that process never goes above 50%, and the rest is reported as idle. Is there some setting that I set inadvertently which is preventing the program from using more than half of the CPU? </p></blockquote>
<p> My psychic powers tell me that you have a single processor with hyperthreading enabled. (Because if you had a dual processor machine, you probably would have mentioned it in your question.) And my psychic powers tell me furthermore that the program in question is single-threaded, or at least has only one thread that is doing CPU-intensive work. Therefore, that thread is being run by one of the hyperthreading units of the CPU, and the other one isn’t doing anything.</p>
<p> That’s why you can’t get more than 50% CPU usage. </p>
