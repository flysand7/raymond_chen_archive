<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What are the requirements for the built-in Windows 10 camera-based barcode scanner?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Windows Point of Service Barcode Scanner supports a camera-based scanner. What are the requirements for this camera?</p>
<p>Basically, the camera-based scanner needs to be able to get a clear, large picture of the barcode.</p>
<p>If the camera is fixed-focus then there’s a good chance it’s just going to get a blurry picture unless you manage to get the target at the right focal distance.</p>
<p>And even if you manage to hit the right distance, it’s probably going to be far enough away from the camera that the barcode itself will be very small.</p>
<p>Autofocus cameras will do much better than fixed-focus camera, since you can hold the barcode relatively close to the camera (to make it big), and the autofocus will try to make the image sharp enough to be readable.</p>
<p>The Point of Service folks tell me that the Surface Pro 3 camera isn’t very good for camera-based barcode scanning. The Surface Book and Surface Go cameras do much better.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://aka.ms/justscanit"> JustScanIt</a> app to tinker with the software camera-based barcode scanner. On the Settings menu, turn on <i>Show Camera Controls</i> to see the controls available for your camera. You can also go to the <i>Device Information</i> screen to view the capabilities of your camera.</p>
