<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Stupid <code>cmd.exe</code> tricks: Entering a directory that doesn’t exist, then immediately leaving</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I discovered that <code>cmd.exe</code> lets you enter a nonexistent directory, as long as you leave it before anybody notices. </p>
<pre>
rem acts like cd C:\Windows
cd C:\doesnt-exist\..\Windows

rem acts like cd C:\Windows
cd C:\really\doesnt-exist\..\..\Windows

rem acts like type C:\Windows\win.ini
type C:\doesnt-exist\..\Windows\win.ini
</pre>
<p>This is handy if you have a full path to a file on the clipboard and you want to access the parent directory. For example, to <code>chdir</code> into the parent directory, you can type <code>cd</code>, a space, and then paste the full path, and then append <code>\..</code> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. </p>
<pre>
rem suppose clipboard contains C:\directory\with\file.txt
rem The next line acts like cd C:\directory\with
cd C:\directory\with\file.txt\..
</pre>
<p>This trick works because <code>cmd.exe</code> does some path simplification before calling into the file system. It sees the <code>..</code> and says, “Oh, I can do that myself!” and uses it to counteract the previous directory. The previous directory is never accessed, so the command processor doesn’t notice that <i>it never existed</i>. </p>
