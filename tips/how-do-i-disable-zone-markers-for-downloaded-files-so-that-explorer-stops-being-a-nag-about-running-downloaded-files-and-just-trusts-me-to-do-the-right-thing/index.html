<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I disable zone markers for downloaded files, so that Explorer stops being a nag about running downloaded files and just trusts me to do the right thing?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>My Little Program about manipulating the zone identifier for downloaded files appears to have struck a nerve with commenter Tess, who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/11/04/10463035.aspx#10463265"> launched into some sort of diatribe about how Microsoft should stop being a busybody and warning users about opening files that they downloaded</a>.
 You are welcome to disable the feature if it offends you so.
 In the Group Policy editor, go to User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Attachment Manager, and enable <i>Do not preserve zone information in file attachments</i>.
 For bonus points, you can set a bunch of other policies to make your computer even more dangerous. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883260"> Here’s a list of them</a>. For example, if your goal is to create the most insecure deployment of Internet Explorer, you can set <i>Inclusion list for moderate risk file types</i> and <i>Inclusion list for low risk file types</i> both to <code>*.*</code>, and then on top of that, set <i>Launching applications and unsafe files</i> to <i>Enabled (not secure)</i> so that Internet Explorer never warns you about running anything.</p>
