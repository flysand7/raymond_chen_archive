<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">In the file copy conflict dialog, what happened to the option to copy the new file with a numeric suffix?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you use Explorer to paste a file into a directory, and there’s already a file with that name in the directory, you get a <i>Replace or Skip Files</i> dialog with options to replace the existing file, skip the file, or compare info for both files. A customer remembered that in earlier versions of Windows, there was no option to compare info, but there <i>was</i> an option to copy the file with a new name, so that the directory contains both the old file (with its original name) and the new file (with a numeric suffix). Where did that option go?</p>

<p>The option to keep both files is still there. It’s hiding under <i>Compare info for both files</i>.</p>

<p>In the resulting dialog, you are given information about the conflicting files and can select which version you want. If you select both versions, then the copied file will have a number added to its name.</p>
