<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Is there a way to disable a specific balloon notification without disabling all of them?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There is a group policy called <i>Turn off all balloon notifications</i>, but what if you want to turn off only one specific notification?
 The taskbar does not offer fine-grained policy control over balloon notifications. All you have is the giant sledgehammer that turns off all of them. If there is a specific balloon you want to disable, you have to check with the specific program that is raising them, or the specific product feature, to see if it offers a way to turn the balloon off.</p>
<p> For example, there is a setting to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/285107"> disable the low disk space checks</a> and another one to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms814801.aspx"> disable notifications that tell you when you have lost the connection to a networked file and are working on the local copy</a>. </p>
