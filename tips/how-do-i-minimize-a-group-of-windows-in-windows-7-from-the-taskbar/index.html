<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I minimize a group of windows in Windows 7 from the taskbar?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Windows 7 taskbar automatically groups similar windows, and when you right-click on the grouped icon, you may get fancy stuff like a jump list or a task list, but you will also get a very small repertoire of window management options. In particular, the only option that operates on the group is <i>Close all windows</i>. What about the other group options?
 To get a list of more group window options, hold the shift key when you right-click on the grouped icon. Then you’ll get more options like <i>Cascade</i> and <i>Minimize all windows</i>.
 Since the contents of the regular right-click pop-up window are dynamic, when you hit “C” for <i>Close all windows</i>, it still waits for you to confirm by hitting Enter. On the other hand, the shift+right-click menu auto-executes <i>Close all windows</i> when you hit the “C” hotkey. Doesn’t save you any more keystrokes (trading an Enter for a shift key), but you do get predictability since the shift+right-click menu is pretty stable.</p>
<p> Bonus tip: To get the System menu for a window, you can right-click on its pop-up thumbnail. </p>
