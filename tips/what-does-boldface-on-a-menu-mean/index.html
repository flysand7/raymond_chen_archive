<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does boldface on a menu mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>On many context menus you will see an item in boldface. For example, if you right-click a text file, you will most likely see “Open” in boldface at the top of the mean. What does the boldface mean?</p>
<p> The boldface menu item is the default command for that menu. It represents the action that would have occurred if you had double-clicked the item instead of viewing its context menu. </p>
<p> In the above example, the fact that “Open” is in boldface means that if you had double-clicked the text file instead of right-clicked it, you would have opened the document. </p>
<p> Programmatically, the default menu item is set via <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Resources/Menus/MenuReference/MenuFunctions/SetMenuDefaultItem.asp"> the SetMenuDefaultItem function</a> and can be retrieved with the corresponding <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Resources/Menus/MenuReference/MenuFunctions/GetMenuDefaultItem.asp"> GetMenuDefaultItem function</a> </p>
<p> If you put a default menu item in a submenu, then Windows will invoke the default item in the submenu when you double-clicking the submenu’s parent. But if you put a default menu item in a top-level menu (i.e., not on a submenu), then it is your responsibility to invoke the default menu item when the user double-clicks the object that led to the menu. (This last bit should be obvious: It is the code for the object being clicked on which decides what to do on a double-click.) </p>
