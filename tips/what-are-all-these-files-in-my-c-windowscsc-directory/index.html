<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What are all these files in my C:WINDOWSCSC directory?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>     This is where Windows keeps the files that you have marked for being available offline.      (CSC was the working name for the feature now called Offline Files. It stands for     Client-Side Caching.)</p>
