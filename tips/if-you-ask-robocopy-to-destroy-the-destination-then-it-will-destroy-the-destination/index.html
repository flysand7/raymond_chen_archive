<p>A customer reported that Explorer was not showing a folder on their hard drive that they were sure was there. </p>
<p>I asked them to check whether the folder really was there, by going to a command prompt and using the <code>dir /a</code> command. </p>
<p>Turns out the folder really was gone. </p>
<p>The customer went back and retraced their steps and reconstructed what happened. </p>
<p>First, the customer created a folder on their <code>D:</code> called <code>D:\backups\fdrive\spreadsheets</code>. </p>
<p>Next the customer copied two files from their <code>F:</code> drive to the <code>D:\backups\fdrive\spreadsheets</code> folder. </p>
<p>So far so good. </p>
<p>Next, the customer wanted to copy their entire <code>F:</code> drive to the  <code>D:\backups\fdrive</code> folder, so they performed the following command: </p>
<pre>
robocopy /MIR F: D:\backups\fdrive
</pre>
<p>The customer let this command run for a while, but then the operation started encountering Access denied errors, so they hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the robocopy command. </p>
<p>At this point, the customer noticed that the <code>spreadsheets</code> folder was gone. </p>
<p>The customer theorized, “I suspect that what happened is that robocopy was matching the directory structure of the <code>F:</code> drive against the directory structure of <code>D:\backups\fdrive</code>, and since my important spreadsheet files weren’t present in the <code>F:\spreadsheets</code> folder on the source, it deleted them from the destination. If I had let the copy run to completion, it presumably would have eventually copied the files from their location on the <code>F:</code> drive to the corresponding subdirectory of <code>D:\backups\fdrive</code>.” </p>
<p>The customer continued, “From a user perspective, it seems that I <i>should</i> have really been alerted by robocopy that the target folder (in this case, <code>D:\backups\fdrive</code>) wasn’t empty, and it should have asked for confirmation that I didn’t really want to lose those files (which I didn’t).” </p>
<p>Well, um, yeah, because that’s what the <code>/MIR</code> option means. </p>
<pre>
       /E :: copy subdirectories, including Empty ones.
   /PURGE :: delete dest files/dirs that no longer exist in source.
     /MIR :: MIRror a directory tree (equivalent to /E plus /PURGE).
</pre>
<p>The <code>/MIR</code> option means that the destination folder should be an exact copy of the source folder. The documentation points out that this is the same as <code>/E</code> (copy recursively) combined with <code>/PURGE</code> (remove anything from the destination that is not present in the source). </p>
<p>The <code>/PURGE</code> behavior is by definition destructive. </p>
<p>If that’s not what you want, then don’t pass the <code>/MIR</code> flag. </p>
