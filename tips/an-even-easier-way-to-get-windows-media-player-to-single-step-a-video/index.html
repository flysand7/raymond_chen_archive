<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">An even easier way to get Windows Media Player to single-step a video</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Since my original article explaining <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/21/10177190.aspx"> how to get Windows Media Player to single-step a video</a>, I’ve learned that there’s an even easier way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pause the video. </li>
<li>To single-step forward, Ctrl+Click the Play button. </li>
<li>To single-step backwrd, Ctrl+Shift+Click the Play button. </li>
</ul>
<p> Backward-stepping is dependent upon the codec; some of them will go backward to the previous keyframe.
