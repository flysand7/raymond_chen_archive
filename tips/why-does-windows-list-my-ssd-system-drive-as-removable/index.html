<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Windows list my SSD system drive as removable?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This has probably happened to you. You right-click the <i>Safely remove hardware and eject media</i> icon, and among the removable devices is your primary hard drive! Surely you can’t eject your primary hard drive. Why is this on the list?</p>
<p>Because the device driver reported that the device was removable.</p>
<p>Explorer doesn’t try to second-guess the device driver. If the device driver says that the drive is removable, then it’s removable.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues reports that whenever he runs into this problem, he installs Intel Rapid Storage Technology, which includes the drivers that fix the problem.</p>
