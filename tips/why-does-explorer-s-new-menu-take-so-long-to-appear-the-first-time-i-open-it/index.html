<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Explorer’s <i>New</i> menu take so long to appear the first time I open it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you right-click on an empty space in an Explorer folder and select the <i>New</i> menu item, there is sometimes a delay of up to two seconds before the menu appears. What’s going on during that delay?</p>
<p>The items in the <i>New</i> menu are discovered by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/shell/context#extending-the-new-submenu"> looking for <code>Shell­New</code> subkeys</a> in <code>HKEY_</code><code>CLASSES_</code><code>ROOT</code>.</p>
<p>This search takes some time, seeing as <code>HKEY_</code><code>CLASSES_</code><code>ROOT</code> is a rather large registry key. The <i>New</i> menu starts a background task to collect all the information and waits up to two seconds for it to report results. If the task doesn’t finish within two seconds, then the <i>New</i> menu gives up waiting and merely shows the result from the previous time the task ran, hoping that no new items were added in the meantime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the task continues to run and eventually completes with a list of items. If it finishes in time, the <i>New</i> menu will use it right away. Otherwise, it is saved for the <i>New</i> menu to use next time.</p>
