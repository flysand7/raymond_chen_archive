<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How to get Windows Media Player to single-step a video</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I always forget how to do this, so I’m going to write it down so I can look it up later.
 When a video is playing, right-click the volume control slider and select <i>Enhancements</i>, then <i>Play speed settings</i>. (Actually, it also works if you right-click the speaker icon, the Stop button, the Replay button, or the Shuffle button, but the volume control slider is the biggest target.)
 On the <i>Play speed settings</i> dialog, the single-step controls are at the bottom; they look like triangles.</p>
