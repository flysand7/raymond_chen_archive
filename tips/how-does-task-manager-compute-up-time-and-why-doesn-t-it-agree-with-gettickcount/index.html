<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does Task Manager compute Up Time, and why doesn't it agree with GetTickCount?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Task Manager shows a piece of information called “Up time”. How is this value calculated, and why doesn’t it agree with the value reported by <code>Get­Tick­Count</code>/<code>Get­Tick­Count64</code>? 
 Task Manager calculates “up time” by subtracting the system boot time from the current time. In other words, it is misnamed; it really should be called <i>time since system was started</i>. It doesn’t subtract out the time when the computer was in sleep or hibernation.</p>
<p> The tick count, on the other hand, counts only time that elapses while the computer is on. </p>
