<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Can a server-side Web application trigger the creation of thumbs.db files?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer had a server-side Web application which creates a large number of image files. The customer was concerned that the system would spend a lot of effort generating thumbnails to be put into the <code>thumbs.db</code> file and wanted to disable the <code>thumbs.db</code> file in order to improve the performance of their Web application. The customer liaison added, “From a brief experiment, it seems that the <code>thumbs.db</code> file is written when a user displays thumbnails on Explorer. Merely creating and copying image files does not trigger the creation of a <code>thumbs.db</code> file. I don’t think the customer needs to worry about the overhead of the <code>thumbs.db</code> file since neither the user account of the Web application nor the SYSTEM account will create a thumbnail cache. Is that correct?” </p>
<p>Yes, that’s correct. </p>
<p>The <code>thumbs.db</code> file is created by Explorer or any other application that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774628(VS.85).aspx">uses Explorer’s thumbnail cache</a>. It is unlikely that the customer’s Web server is using the Explorer thumbnail cache, so the file won’t be created. </p>
<p>To be extra sure, the customer can set the policy <i>User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, File Explorer, <a href="http://gpsearch.azurewebsites.net/#4762">Turn off the caching of thumbnails in hidden thumbs.db files</a></i>. </p>
<p>The customer liaison thanked us for confirming what their experimentation revealed. </p>
