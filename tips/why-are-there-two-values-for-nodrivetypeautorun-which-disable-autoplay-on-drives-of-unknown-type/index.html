<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why are there two values for NoDriveTypeAutoRun which disable Autoplay on drives of unknown type?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

the <code>No­Drive­Type­Auto­Run</code> policy</a>
as consisting of a bitfield whose values are as follows:

Hey, wait, two of the entries are the same.
What’s the difference between 0x1 (<i>Disables Autoplay
on drives of unknown type</i>)
and
0x80 (<i>Disables Autoplay on drives of unknown type</i>)?
</p>
<p>
The values in the bitfield correspond to return values
of the <code>Get­Drive­Type</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
#define DRIVE_UNKNOWN     0
#define DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR 1
#define DRIVE_REMOVABLE   2
#define DRIVE_FIXED       3
#define DRIVE_REMOTE      4
#define DRIVE_CDROM       5
#define DRIVE_RAMDISK     6
</pre>
<p>
The value 0x1 corresponds to bit zero, which means that
the <code>Get­Drive­Type</code> function could not tell what
type of drive it is.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the value 0x80 does not correspond to
any known return value of <code>Get­Drive­Type</code>.
It’s reserved for future use.
</p>
<p>
My guess as to how this happened is that the original table
did not have an entry for 0x80.
Then somebody asked,
“What does 0x80 mean?”
</p>
<p>
The response was,
“It’s not used yet.
It’s for some future unknown drive type that has yet to be invented.”
</p>
<p>
“Okay, thanks. I’ll just say that the drive type is unknown.”
</p>
<p>
Bingo, now you have two copies of “drives of unknown type.”
The 0x1 means “drives whose type cannot be determined”
whereas the 0x80 means
“drives of a type not currently known to mankind.”
</p>
<p>
So let’s just pretend that the entry for
0x80 reads “Reserved for future use.”

going to be updating it.)

<b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>:
“Autoplay is the stupidest feature on the face of the planet.”
The issue here is not discussing whether Autoplay is a good idea or
bad idea.
I’m trying to improve the documentation.
I try to avoid providing tips/support about
controversial features because of the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/07/9991494.aspx">
flame-fest that invariably results</a>.
This is an experiment to see if it’s safe to go back into the water.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b>: Comments have been disabled because everybody wants to
discuss whether Autoplay is a good idea or not, even though that topic
was explicitly taken off the table.
Strike two.</p>
