<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can use a Coke slogan as your password, but not a Pepsi one</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/"> Larry Osterman</a> mentioned <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2008/06/03/news-flash-spaces-are-legal-characters-in-both-filenames-and-passwords.aspx"> News Flash: Spaces are legal characters in both filenames and passwords</a>, I was reminded of my own little experiment with passwords and spaces.
 Over a decade ago, I tried using spaces in my password, and they were accepted, but I ran into a different problem: Brand name bias.</p>
<p> The password system accepted “Coke adds life” as my password, but it rejected “Pepsi the choice of a new generation”. Why did the password system accept a Coke slogan but not a Pepsi one? <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/community/columns/security/askus/au042400.mspx"> Hint</a>. </p>
