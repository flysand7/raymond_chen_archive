<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I find all files with at least one space in their name?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
You already know how to do this,
you just don’t realize it.
</p>
<p>
How do you find files with an “x” in their name?
That’s right, you use <code>dir *x*</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now you just have to change that x to a space.
And since spaces are command line delimiters, you need to quote
the sequence so it gets treated as a single parameter
rather than two “*” parameters:
</p>
<pre>
dir "* *"
</pre>
<p>
Stick in a <code>/s</code> if you want to search recursively.</p>
