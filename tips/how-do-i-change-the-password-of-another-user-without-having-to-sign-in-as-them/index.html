<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I change the password of another user without having to sign in as them?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Here’s a quick trick: You are signed in as yourself, but you need to change the password for another account, say, a service account. You could change the account by doing this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Add the account to your machine.</li>
<li>Sign in as that user.</li>
<li>Change the password.</li>
<li>Sign out.</li>
<li>Sign back in as yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that’s a lot of work, and it adds the account to your machine just to change its password. </p>
<p>Here’s the trick: You can change the password directly from the password change dialog. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>.</li>
<li>Select <i>Change a password</i>.</li>
<li>On the <i>Change a password</i> screen,     focus defaults to the <i>Old password</i> edit box,     but you can go up to the account name box and change     the account name to the account whose password you want to change.</li>
<li>Enter the account name, the old password, and the new password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bingo, you changed somebody else’s password without having to sign out or even add them to your local machine. </p>
