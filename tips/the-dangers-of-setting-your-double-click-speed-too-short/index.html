<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The dangers of setting your double-click speed too short</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>After I noted how <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/23/8417521.aspx"> the window manager uses the double-click time as a basis for determining how good your reflexes are</a>, people got all excited about <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/04/28/speed-up-the-feel-of-windows-with-the-double-click-speed-setting/"> reducing the double-click speed to make Windows feel peppier</a>. But be careful not to go overboard.</p>
<p> Back in the Windows 95 days, we got a bug from a beta tester that went roughly like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b>Title</b>: Double-clicks stop working after using mouse control panel<br/> <b>Reproducibility</b>: Consistent, hardware-independent<br/> <b>Severity</b>: Major loss of functionality<br/> <b>Description</b>: </p>
<ol>
<li>Open the mouse control panel. </li>
<li>Go to the Double-click speed slider. </li>
<li>Drag the slider all the way to the right (fastest). </li>
<li>Click OK. </li>
</ol>
<p> Result: Mouse double-clicks no longer recognized. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> We had to explain to the beta tester that, no, everything is actually working as intended. But if you set the double-click slider to the fastest setting, you had better be good at double-clicking really fast. You have clearly set the double-click speed was faster than you are physically capable of double-clicking. Maybe you can ask your twelve-year-old nephew to do your double-clicking for you. </p>
<p> That’s why there is the test icon next to the slider. Before clicking OK, make sure you can still double-click the test icon. If you can’t, then you picked a setting that’s too fast for your reflexes and you should consider a slower setting. </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive Yuhong Bao comment</b>: In Windows 95, the test icon was a jack-in-the-box. </p>
