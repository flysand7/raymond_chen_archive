<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Psychic debugging: Why does opening a command prompt always print a weird error message?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Every so often, somebody reports that whenever they open a command prompt, they get a weird error message between the version banner and the prompt. </p>

<p>Where is that message “The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect” coming from? </p>
<p>My psychic powers tell me that it’s coming from <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071121-00/?p=24433/">AutoRun</a>. </p>
<p>AutoRun is a hidden gotcha of the command processor which lets you set a registry key to inject a command into every command prompt as soon as it starts up. And I’m guessing that there’s a rogue AutoRun entry that is doing something which is generating that message. </p>
<p>For example, I was able to reproduce the message by doing this: </p>
<pre>
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /d \"C:|
</pre>
<p>After running this command, open a command prompt, and you’ll get that same error message. </p>
<p>And before you forget, run this command to get rid of the bogus AutoRun: </p>
<pre>
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /f
</pre>
