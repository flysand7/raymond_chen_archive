<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Settings app lets me pick a custom color for my mouse pointer, how do I get in on that action?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In the <i>Settings</i> app, under <i>Ease of Access</i>, <i>Cursor &amp; pointer</i>, you can choose your mouse pointer color. There are some preselected colors, but there’s also an option to choose a custom color.</p>
<p>Some people are looking to see how mouse custom colors work, specifically, what registry key they need to modify to set the color.</p>
<p>There is no registry key that controls the mouse pointer color.</p>
<p>So how does it work?</p>
<p>Simple: The Settings app creates a brand new mouse cursor from scratch based on the color you picked: It painstakingly generates a bitmap that has the color you want, converts it to a cursor file, and saves it to your profile. And then it sets those custom-made cursors as your default mouse cursors.</p>
<p>In other words, each time you pick a color, you get an artisanal mouse cursor, hand-crafted and made to order.</p>
