<p>Has this ever happened to you? You’re hard at work <strike>blasting zombies</strike> being super-productive with a program that has an always-on-top fullscreen window. And then the program hangs. How can you get to Task Manager so you can kill the hung program? </p>
<p>One way to do this is to launch Task Manager and use keyboard accelerators to get it to be always-on-top: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hit     <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>     and say that you want to run Task Manager.     Task Manager will run, but it’s covered by the always-on-top fullscreen     window.</li>
<li>Whenever you need to see Task Manager,     use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to select     Task Manager and hold the <kbd>Alt</kbd> for a few seconds.     This will give you a preview of Task Manager so you can     see what state it is in.     You can’t interact with it, but you can at least see it.</li>
<li>If Task Manager is in compact mode, then press     <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to get out of compact mode     into details mode.     If you’re the sort of person who     likes to open Task Manager a lot, you are probably already     in details mode.</li>
<li>Type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> followed by     <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to enable <i>Always on Top</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have an always-on-top Task Manager, and you can now use it to select the hung program and terminate it. </p>
<p>But here’s a shortcut: Use virtual desktops. </p>
<ul>
<li>Press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to call up the switcher.</li>
<li>Click the <kbd>+</kbd> to create a new virtual desktop.     This gives you a clean desktop with nothing on it.     In particular, the hung application is not on this desktop.</li>
<li>Run Task Manager on this new virtual desktop and use it to     terminate the hung program.</li>
</ul>
