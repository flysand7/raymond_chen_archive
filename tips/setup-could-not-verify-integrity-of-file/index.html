<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Setup could not verify integrity of file</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>          When you try to install a patch, you may get the error message “Setup could not verify          integrity of file. Make sure the cryptographic service is running.”       </p>
<p>          This typically means that the signature catalog has been corrupted. There was a patch          to fix this problem, but of course if you haven’t been keeping up with your patches          you probably don’t have that patch yet either, and of course you can’t install that          patch yet either because the signature catalog is corrupted…       </p>
<p>          Fortunately, the nice people at <a href="http://www.updatexp.com/">http://www.updatexp.com/</a> have          written up a web page <a href="http://www.updatexp.com/cryptographic-service.html">describing          how to fix it</a>.       </p>
