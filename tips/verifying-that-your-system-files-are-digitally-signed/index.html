<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Verifying that your system files are digitally signed</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you want to re-check that the files on your system  haven’t been tampered with, you can run  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/datacenter/help/sig_verification_tool.htm">  sigverif</a>  (by typing its name into the Start.Run dialog)  and tell it to start scanning.
  (UI note: If you go into the Logging page on the Advanced dialog,  you can get trapped where it insists on having a valid  log file name even if you didn’t ask for logging!)
  The signature verification process takes a while, so go and  do something else while you’re waiting. When it’s done, you’ll  get a list of all the system files that are not digitally  signed by Microsoft.  Just because a file is listed here  doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily bad, however.  For example, it might be a video driver or printer driver.
  (Another UI note: You can’t right-click the items in the list  to view their properties, say, to see what company issued the files.)</p>
<p>  One case when you would want to run sigverif is after you remove  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/12/54634.aspx">  the test root certificate  which was causing your desktop to say “for test/evaluation purposes  only”</a>.  That way you can find all the uncertified drivers that snuck in  under cover of the test signature.  </p>
