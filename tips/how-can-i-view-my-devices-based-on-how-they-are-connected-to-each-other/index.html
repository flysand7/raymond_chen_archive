<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I view my devices based on how they are connected to each other?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>More than once, someone mentioned to me that one feature they really want to see in Windows is the ability to view the devices in the system and how they are connected to each other.</p>
<p>It turns out this feature has existed since the first version of Device Manager back in 1995. It’s just that people don’t know about it.</p>
<p>In Device Manager, go to the <i>View</i> menu and select <i>View by connection</i>. This reorganizes the display so that the structure reflects how the various devices are connected to each other.</p>
