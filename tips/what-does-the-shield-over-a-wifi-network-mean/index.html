<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What does the shield over a WiFi network mean?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Windows 10 has a new icon in the networking flyout:</p>

<p style="clear: both;">It’s a WiFi network with a shield and an exclamation point. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means that the network is not secure.</p>
<p>What does it mean for the network not to be secure?</p>
<p>It’s the same as “Open”. The network does not require a password and consequently does not use encryption. Anybody can snoop on your network activity unless you take your own encryption measures (such as using https).</p>
