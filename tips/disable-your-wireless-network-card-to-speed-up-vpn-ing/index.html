<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Disable your wireless network card to speed up VPN’ing</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> As a follow-up to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/20/1109013.aspx"> my tip on speeding up connecting via RAS and a SmartCard</a>, I’ve been told that another trick you can do is to disable your wireless networking card before initiating the VPN connection. Wireless networking cards are a huge attack surface, and the VPN software spends a lot of time trying to secure it. </p>
<p> I don’t have a wireless networking card on the machine I use at home to connect to the work network, so I haven’t tried it, but who knows, maybe it’ll work for you. </p>
