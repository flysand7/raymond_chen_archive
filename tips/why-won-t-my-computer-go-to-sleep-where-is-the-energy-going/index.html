<p>The <code>powercfg</code> utility <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/13/7658352.aspx"> has been around for a while</a>, but in Windows 7, it gained a little bit more awesome.
 <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/jamesone/archive/2009/02/18/testing-windows-7-on-a-laptop-try-this.aspx"> <code>powercfg /energy</code></a> will analyze your computer’s power consumption and report on things like devices that prevent the computer from sleeping, devices which won’t suspend, and processes which are increasing your battery drain.</p>
<p> Another neat flag is <code>powercfg /requests</code> which will report on why your computer can’t go to sleep, for example, because it has open files on the network, or because the clown will eat it. </p>
