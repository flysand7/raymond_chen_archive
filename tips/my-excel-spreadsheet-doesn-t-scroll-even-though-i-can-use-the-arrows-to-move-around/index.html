<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">My Excel spreadsheet doesn’t scroll even though I can use the arrows to move around</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I was sent a link to an Excel spreadsheet with instructions to look for my name and update the <i>blah blah blah blah</i>. When I opened the spreadsheet, I found that I couldn’t get it to scroll. I could use the arrow keys to move around: The coordinate indicator and the formula bar both updated to reflect where I had gone to, but the window wouldn’t scroll to show the current cell.</p>
<p>Eventually, I figured out what happened.</p>
<p>The panes were <i>frozen</i>.</p>
<p>To unfreeze them, go to the <i>View</i> tab, then open the <i>Freeze Panes</i> menu and select <i>Unfreeze Panes</i>.</p>
<p>What happened is that somebody had used the same menu and selected <i>Freeze Panes</i> while the current cell was somewhere around cell <i>H50</i>. This means that the first seven columns (A through G) and 49 rows (1 through 49) were locked in place, and any scrollable content appeared to the right and below.</p>
<p>They must have done this on a monitor far larger than mine, because my screen wasn’t big enough to show that many rows and columns. All of the scrollable content was being jammed into a region that didn’t even fit on the screen!</p>
