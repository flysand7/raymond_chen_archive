<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do my file creation, access, or modified time disappear if I set it to midnight on January 1, 1980?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer discovered that if their program used the <code>Set­File­Time</code> function to set a network file’s creation, access, or modified time to the specific value of “midnight on January 1, 1980”, then the corresponding timestamp is removed. What’s up with that? </p>
<p>As you may recall, midnight on January 1, 1980 is <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20051028-29/?p=33573/">a special sentinel value</a>: It is the epoch for the MS-DOS time/date format. </p>
<p>At this point, I believe the responsible thing to do is to speculate irresponsibly. </p>
<p>It appears that the network server they are using is trying very hard to accommodate MS-DOS clients. In particular, if somebody tries to set a file timestamp to midnight January 1, 1980, the server assumes that the client is trying to clear the timestamp. </p>
<p>Explorer is one of those accommodating programs. If it sees a file whose timestamp is exactly January 1, 1980 at midnight, then it assumes that the timestamp came from a FAT filesystem (possibly tunnelled through other file systems along the way, like a network redirector), and treats it as equivalent to a missing timestamp. </p>
