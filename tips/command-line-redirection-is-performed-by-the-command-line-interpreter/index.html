<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Command line redirection is performed by the command line interpreter</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
The magic characters like
<tt>&lt;</tt>,
<tt>&gt;</tt>, and
<tt>|</tt>
in command lines like
</p>
<pre>
myprogram.exe | sort &gt; output.txt
</pre>
<p>
are interpreted by the command interpreter <code>CMD.EXE</code>;
they aren’t built into the <code>CreateProcess</code> function.
(This is obvious if you think about it.
That command line created two processes; which one should
<code>CreateProcess</code> return a handle to?)
</p>
<p>
If you pass a command line like this to <code>CreateProcess</code>,
it will merely run the
<code>myprogram.exe</code> program with the command line arguments
“<tt>| sort &gt; output.txt</tt>“.
(The <code>ShellExecute</code> function behaves similarly.)
If you want these characters to be interpreted as redirection
operators, you need to give them to someone who will interpret
those characters in the manner you intend:
</p>
<pre>
cmd.exe /C myprogram.exe | sort &gt; output.txt
</pre>
<p>
Since different command line interpreters use different syntax,
you have to specify which command line interpreter you want to use.
</p>
<p>
If the command line came from the user, you probably want to use
the <code>COMSPEC</code> variable in order to give the command
to the user’s command line interpreter of choice.</p>
