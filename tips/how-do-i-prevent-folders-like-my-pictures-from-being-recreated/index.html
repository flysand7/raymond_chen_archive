<p>Another converse of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/04/23/10519589.aspx"> <i>How do I programmatically create folders like My Pictures if they were manually deleted?</i></a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/23/268486.aspx"> <i>Why do folders like “My Pictures” come back after I delete them?</i></a> is <i>How do I prevent folders like My Pictures from being recreated?</i>
 Starting in Windows 7, there is a group policy called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744697(v=WS.10).aspx#WS_DisableKnownFolders"> <i>Disable Known Folders</i></a> which lets you specify a list of known folders which should be disabled.
 If somebody tries to create a known folder programmatically, the call will fail with <code>ERROR_ACCESS_DISABLED_BY_POLICY</code>.</p>
<p> Note that this policy only blocks creation of the folder. If the folder already exists, then the policy has no effect. (You’re locking the door after the horse has bolted.) </p>
