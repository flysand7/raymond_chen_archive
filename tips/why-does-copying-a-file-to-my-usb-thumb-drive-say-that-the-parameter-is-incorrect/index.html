<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does copying a file to my USB thumb drive say that the parameter is incorrect?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Consider the following sequence of operations, assuming that F: is a
USB thumb drive with plenty of disk space.
</p>
<pre>
C:\Users\Bob\Downloads&gt; copy readme.txt F:\
        1 file(s) copied.
C:\Users\Bob\Downloads&gt; copy Update.iso F:\
The parameter is incorrect.
</pre>
<p>
Why is the second file copy failing?
</p>
<p>
The hint is the file extension: *.iso, which suggests that this
is a CD or DVD image, and DVD images have the feature that they
tend to be really big.

big.
</p>
<p>
USB thumb drives tend to be formatted with the FAT32 file system
rather than
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/05/108205.aspx">
with NTFS</a>.
And
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314463">
FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB minus one byte</a>.
</p>
<p>
The user confirmed that the <code>Update.iso</code> file was
larger than 4GB and that the USB thumb drive was formatted as FAT32.
</p>
<p>
Mind you, the error message doesn’t help at all in identifying
that this is what’s going on.
I don’t know where it’s coming from, but my guess is that
somewhere inside the <code>copy</code> command, it tries to create
the destination file and set its file size.
Since the file size is out of range for FAT32, the call fails
with the error <code>ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER</code>,
and that’s what ends up bubbling out to the user.
</p>
<p>
But at least now you know what the confusing error message is trying
to tell you.</p>
