<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">When you start getting in-page errors on your hard drive, it’s time to go shopping for a new hard drive, redux</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I explained that <a href="/tips/when-you-start-getting-in-page-errors-on-your-hard-drive-it-s-time-to-go-shopping-for-a-new-hard-drive"> receiving a <code>STATUS_IN_PAGE_ERROR</code> from your hard drive means that it’s time to go shopping for a new hard drive</a>. It means that the system needed to page in code or data from a storage device, but the storage device was unable to produce the data. This can happen if you are running a program from removable media or over the network, but if it happens for your hard drive, that’s bad news.</p>
<p>Your hard drive is starting to die. Back up everything you can and replace it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Now, the <code>STATUS_IN_PAGE_ERROR</code> code is used when the system could not page data in for a user-mode application, and the kernel is forced to terminate the program. But the I/O failure could also occur if the system could not page data in for the kernel itself, and that’s a much more dire situation.</p>
<p>There is no process to terminate when the kernel itself suffers an in-page error. The only thing it can do is terminate itself, and that gives you <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140910-00/?p=44113"> the infamous blue screen of death</a>.</p>
<p>There are two different stop codes for in-page errors, depending on whether the thing that couldn’t be paged in was static data or stack data.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Stop number</th>
<th>Stop code</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>0x77</tt></td>
<td><tt>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>0x7A</tt></td>
<td><tt>KERNEL_STACK_INPAGE_ERROR</tt></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The difference between them is not really important. They both mean, “Back up all your data and get a new hard drive ASAP.”</p>
