<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is this Xerox directory doing in Program Files?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you go snooping around, you may find an empty <code>C:\Program Files\Xerox</code> directory. What’s that for?</p>
<p> This directory is being watched by Windows File Protection, because it needs to protect the file <code>xrxflnch.exe</code> should it ever show up. (Why does the directory have to exist in order for Windows File Protection to be able to watch it? I’m told it’s a limitation of the Windows File Protection engine. I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/fileio/base/findfirstchangenotification.asp"> the <code>FindFirstChangeNotification</code> function</a> can’t watch a directory that doesn’t exist.) </p>
<p> Why is <code>xrxflnch.exe</code> so special? I don’t know. My guess is that it’s some file that is frequently overwritten by setup programs and therefore needs to be protected. </p>
