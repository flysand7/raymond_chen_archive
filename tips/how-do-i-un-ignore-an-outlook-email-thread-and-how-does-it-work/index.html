<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I un-ignore an Outlook email thread, and how does it work?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Okay, first to answer the “How to do it” part of the question: To un-ignore an email thread, find a message that is part of the ignored thread and select it. The <i>Ignore</i> button in the ribbon will go into the pressed state to indicate that this thread is being ignored. Click the <i>Ignore</i> button to uncheck it, thereby un-ignoring the thread.</p>
<p>Note that un-ignoring a thread will not un-delete the messages that were ignored when the rule was in effect. But future messages will not be ignored.</p>
<p>Okay, so how does this work internally? If you open your Rules, you won’t find any rules for deleting the ignored thread. Where are the ignored-thread rules kept?</p>
<p>The rules for ignored threads are kept in a hidden folder in your mailbox named <i>Conversation Action Settings</i>, in the <i>Associated Contents</i> table. You can use <a href="https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi"> the MFCMAPI tool</a> to view them.</p>
<p>This trick is handy not just for snooping around under the hood: It’s also useful if you want to un-ignore a thread for which you don’t have a copy in your <i>Deleted Items</i> folder. You can go into the <i>Associated Contents</i> table and delete the rule for the ignored thread. (Note: I’ve never done this myself, but it’s nice to know I could do this if I had to.)</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Rules for ignored threads <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/messages-in-an-e-mail-thread-are-automatically-moved-to-the-deleted-items-folder-7681a141-0b24-02ad-daac-32312bfcffd0"> expire after 14 days of inactivity</a>, which is nice to know. It means that your <i>Conversation Action Settings</i> folder is self-cleaning to some degree.</p>
