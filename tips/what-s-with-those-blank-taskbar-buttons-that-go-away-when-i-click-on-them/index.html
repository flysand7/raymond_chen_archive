<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What's with those blank taskbar buttons that go away when I click on them?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sometimes you’ll find a blank taskbar button that goes away when you click on it. What’s the deal with that?
There are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_int/shell_int_programming/taskbar.asp">some basic rules on which windows go into the taskbar</a>. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the WS_EX_APPWINDOW extended style is set, then it will show (when visible).   </li>
<li>If the window is a top-level unowned window, then it will show (when visible).   </li>
<li>Otherwise it doesn’t show. </li>
</ul>
<p>(Though the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/itaskbarlist/itaskbarlist.asp">ITaskbarList</a> interface muddies this up a bit.)
When a taskbar-eligible window becomes visible, the taskbar creates a button for it. When a taskbar-eligible window becomes hidden, the taskbar removes the button.
The blank buttons appear when a window changes between taskbar-eligible and taskbar-ineligible <em>while it is visible</em>. Follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Window is taskbar-eligible.   </li>
<li>Window becomes visible ? taskbar button created.   </li>
<li>Window goes taskbar-ineligible.   </li>
<li>Window becomes hidden ? since the window is not taskbar-eligible at this point, the taskbar ignores it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Result: A taskbar button that hangs around with no window attached to it.
This is why the documentation also advises, “If you want to dynamically change a window’s style to one that doesn’t support visible taskbar buttons, you must hide the window first (by calling <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/showwindow.asp">ShowWindow</a> with SW_HIDE), change the window style, and then show the window.”
Bonus question: Why doesn’t the taskbar pay attention to <em>all</em> windows as they come and go?</p>
<p>Answer: Because that would be expensive. The filtering out of windows that aren’t taskbar-eligible happens inside USER32 and it then notifies the taskbar (or anybody else who has installed a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Hooks/HookReference/HookFunctions/ShellProc.asp%0D%0A">WH_SHELL hook</a>) via one of the HSHELL_* notifications only if a taskbar-eligibie window has changed state. That way, the taskbar code doesn’t get paged in when there’s nothing for it to to. </p>
