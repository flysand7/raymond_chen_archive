<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I change among the three levels of play in Space Cadet Pinball?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Many many years ago, a customer presumably was taking advantage of the <i>unlimited support</i> part of their support contract when they asked </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> In the documentation for Space Cadet Pinball, it says… </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The game is divided into three levels of play: basic, intermediate, and advanced. The objective of all levels is to achieve the highest point total. The more advanced the level of play, the greater the point reward. </p></blockquote>
<p> How does one advance to the next level of play? The documentation doesn’t explain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The level of play being described in the documentation refers not to any particular in-game option or accomplishment. It’s describing three different styles of playing the same game. </p>
<ul>
<li>Basic level: You try not to lose the ball. </li>
<li>Intermediate level: You earn more points by     hitting the targets in the right order. </li>
<li>Advanced level: You earn even more points by completing missions. </li>
</ul>
<p> It’s like how you can play tennis on multiple levels. </p>
<ul>
<li>Basic level: Chase the ball when it is hit to you,     and return it over the net. </li>
<li>Intermediate level: Anticipate where the ball will be hit,     and return it to where your opponent     will have difficulty reaching it. </li>
<li>Advanced level:     Plan multiple-stroke attacks.     Identify your opponent’s weakness and     adjust your style of play to take advantage of it. </li>
</ul>
<p> In other words, the answer is not in the game. The answer is inside you. </p>
