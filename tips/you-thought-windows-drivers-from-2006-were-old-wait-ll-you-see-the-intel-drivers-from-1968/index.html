<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You thought Windows drivers from 2006 were old, wait’ll you see the Intel drivers from 1968!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I noted that <a href="/other/why-are-all-windows-drivers-dated-june-21-2006-don-t-you-ever-update-drivers"> all Windows drivers are dated June 21, 2006</a>. This is a date hack so that the Windows-provided driver is always treated as the driver of last resort, taking a back seat to any manufacturer-provided drivers, which will have a more recent date.</p>
<p>The Intel drivers use the same trick, but <a href="https://downloadmirror.intel.com/29227/eng/Readme_Public.txt"> they go even further back</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Note: Intel(R) Chipset Device Software uses an unusual date for the devices it is targeting. The date 07/18/1968 is symbolic – Intel was founded that day. The reason this date is used is to lower the rank of Intel(R) Chipset Device Software.</p>
<p>This is necessary because it’s a supporting utility that should not overwrite any other drivers. Updating Intel(R) Chipset Device Software is not needed – do not worry if you don’t have the latest version.</p>
