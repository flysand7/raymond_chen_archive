<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why did I lose 3D display mode when I upgraded to the next version of Windows 10?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer was using the 3D display mode feature, which can be selected from the Display settings:</p>

<p>They found that after an update of Windows 10, the <i>3D display mode</i> option disappeared. The customer liaison said that the log files are unavailable from the customer but was nevertheless hoping for some background information that could help with troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The graphics team explained that in order to get 3D display mode, you must have a graphics card that supports it, a driver that is capable of producing it, and a monitor that can render it. They also note that nothing has changed in the system recently with respect to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/stereoscopic-3d"> support for 3D display mode</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that <i>did</i> change was manufacturer support for 3D mode.</p>
<p>In March 2019, <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2019/03/11/nvidia-3d-vision-end-of-support/"> NVIDIA announced</a> that <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4781"> the April 2019 the GeForce Game Ready Drivers would be the last version to support NVIDIA 3D Vision</a>. They advise that users who wish to continue using 3D Vision remain on that driver version, which will receive critical updates until April 2020.</p>
<p>The customer checked their video driver and noted that it had been upgraded to a version that no longer supports 3D. They confirmed that rolling back to the older version of the driver restored the <i>3D display mode</i> option.</p>
<p>Mind you, we have already passed the end of support for that version of the driver, so the customer is basically on their own now with an outdated, unsupported driver.</p>
