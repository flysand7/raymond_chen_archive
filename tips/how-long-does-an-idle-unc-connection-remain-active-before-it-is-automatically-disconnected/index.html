<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How long does an idle UNC connection remain active before it is automatically disconnected?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you access a resource via a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc232144.aspx#universal_naming_convention"> UNC</a>, the Windows network redirector keeps the virtual circuit open for a while even after you close the resource. This is done to take advantage of locality: If you access a network resource once, you’re probably going to access it again in a short time, so the redirector leaves the connection open for a little bit, on the off chance that you’re going to use it again. For example, if copying a bunch of files from a server via a UNC, once one file copy is complete, the next one is going to start very shortly thereafter.
 If there is no activity on a connection for a while, then the redirector decides, “Okay, well, I guess that’s all there is for that” and closes the connection.</p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58896.mspx"> default duration for this “UNC grace period” is ten minutes</a>. You can customize it by setting the <code>KeepConn</code> parameter. Increasing the value will keep the connection active longer, which is a greater convenience for the client, but it also increases the load on the server. </p>
