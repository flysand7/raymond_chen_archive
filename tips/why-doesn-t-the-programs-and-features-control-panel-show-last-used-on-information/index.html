<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why doesn’t the Programs and Features control panel show Last Used On information?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer observed that the <i>Last Used On</i> column in the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel doesn’t appear by default, and if they turn it on, the column is simply blank. The customer wanted to confirm this behavior and asked if there was a way to obtain the <i>Last Used On</i> information by some other means.</p>
<p>I thought it was odd that the customer asked us to confirm what they were seeing. “When I hold my arms above my head, my shoulder hurts. Can you confirm that?” Um, it’s your shoulder. We can’t tell you how your shoulder feels.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that what they wanted was not a confirmation that their eyes were not deceiving them, but rather a confirmation that the behavior is intentional.</p>
<p>And yes, it is intentional.</p>
<p>The <i>Last Used On</i> information was always a guess, and a really dodgy one at that. As we noted earlier, if the application itself does not provide the information, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040709-00/?p=38493"> the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel runs some really coarse heuristics to find the program</a>, consisting mostly of matching words in the program name in the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel against the words in the program name in the Start menu.</p>
<p>There is no way to provide <i>Last Used On</i> information in the application registration (which makes sense since that is a dynamic concept not know at registration time), so for the <i>Last Used On</i> property, the system is always guessing.</p>
<p>The heuristic is bad, and it eventually was recognized as so laughably bad that it simply wasn’t worth trying.</p>
<p>The column still exists in case there are programs which programmatically extract data from the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel. They will still have a column to manipulate, but the column never contains any useful information.</p>
<p>The customer insisted upon an alternative mechanism that gave them the <i>Last Used On</i> information. I got the impression that they use this information to decide which programs their employees are using.</p>
<p>I guess if you want to know for real when a program is run, you can turn on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/configure-an-applocker-policy-for-audit-only"> AppLocker auditing</a>. But the <i>Programs and Features</i> control panel doesn’t try any more.</p>
