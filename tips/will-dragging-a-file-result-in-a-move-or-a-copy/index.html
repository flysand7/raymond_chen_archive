<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Will dragging a file result in a move or a copy?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Some people are confused by the seemingly random behavior when you drag a file.  Do you get a move or a copy? </p>
<p> And you’re right to be confused because it’s not obvious until you learn the secret. Mind you, this secret hasn’t changed since 1989, but an old secret is still a secret just the same. (Worse: An old secret is a compatibility constraint.) </p>
<ul>
<li>If Ctrl+Shift are held down, then the operation creates a shortcut. </li>
<li>If Shift is held down, then the operation is a move. </li>
<li>If Ctrl is held down, then the operation is a copy. </li>
<li>If no modifiers are held down and the source and destination are     on the same drive, then the operation is a move. </li>
<li>If no modifiers are held down and the source and destination are     on different drives, then the operation is a copy. </li>
</ul>
<p> This is one of the few places where the fact that there are things called “drives” makes itself known to the end user in a significant way. </p>
