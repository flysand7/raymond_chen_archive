<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How can I tell if I have the 64-bit edition of Windows?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Answer: Your wallet is empty.
 Seriously, there is no way you bought an Itanium by mistake. They are expensive machines: The entry-level workstation available from HP (who co-developed the Itanium with Intel) goes for over $3000 and the entry-level server is over $13,000. And in addition to paying for the computer itself, you probably had to install a custom air conditioning system for your building to keep it cool.</p>
<p> If you still aren’t sure whether you have one, go to Help.About in Explorer. At the top of the About box, it will say “Windows XP 64-Bit Edition” if you have it. </p>
