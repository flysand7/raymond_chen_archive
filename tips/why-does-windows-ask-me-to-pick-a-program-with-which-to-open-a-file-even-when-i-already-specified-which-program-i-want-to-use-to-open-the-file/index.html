<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Windows ask me to pick a program with which to open a file, even when I already specified which program I want to use to open the file?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>So you’re working at your computer, everything is humming along just fine, and then when you double-click a file, instead of launching the associated application, Windows asks you what program you want to use to launch the document. Why doesn’t it just follow the instructions you gave it already?</p>
<p>A customer installed a new program that supports XYZ files, but was careful not to let that program take over as the XYZ file handler. But when they double-click a XYZ file, they still get the “How do you want to open this file?” dialog.</p>

<p>“Could you please confirm whether this is expected behavior? If so, what is it that changes when a new app is installed that triggers this prompt?”</p>
<p>Yes, this is expected.</p>
<p>If an app is installed that registers support for a file type, then the next time you launch a file of that type, Windows will confirm that you want to stay with the app you have, rather than switch to the new one.</p>
<p>You should be prompted only once per file type, at least until you install another app that registers for that file type.</p>
<p>Why does Windows prompt you one more time after installing a program that supports the file type?</p>
<p>Well, you may have installed that program with the intention of making it the default handler. Or conversely, a recently-installed program may have forced itself as the default handler (possibly by nefarious means), and this gives you a chance to switch it back.</p>
<p>In both cases, the dialog saves you a trip to the <i>Choose default apps by file type</i> settings page, which is important because most users don’t even realize that such a page even exists.</p>
