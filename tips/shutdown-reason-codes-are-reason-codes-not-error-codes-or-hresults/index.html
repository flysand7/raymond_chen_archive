A customer liaison asked the following question on behalf of
his customer:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>
My customer is finding that their Windows Server 2003 system has
restarted, and they want to find out why.
I’ve found some event log similar to the ones below,
but I don’t know what error code <code>0x84020004</code> is.
I’ve searched the Knowledge Base but couldn’t find anything relevant.
Please let me know why the system restarted.
</p>

<p>
The value <code>0x84020004</code> is not an error code.
It says right there that it’s a reason code:
</p>
<pre>
<u>Reason Code</u>: 0x84020004
</pre>
<p>
The system shutdown reason codes
are documented in MSDN under the devious heading
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376885.aspx">
System Shutdown Reason Codes</a>.
In this case, the value <code>0x84020004</code> is a combination of
</p>
<pre>
SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_PLANNED               0x80000000
SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_CLEAN_UI              0x04000000 // reason.h
SHTDN_REASON_MAJOR_OPERATINGSYSTEM      0x00020000
SHTDN_REASON_MINOR_RECONFIG             0x00000004
</pre>
<p>
That value for <code>SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_CLEAN_UI</code> is missing
from the MSDN documentation for some reason, but’s listed in
<code>reason.h</code>.
The flag means that the system was shut down in a controlled manner,
as opposed to <code>SHDTN_REASON_FLAG_DIRTY_UI</code> which means
that the system lost power and did not go through a clean shutdown.
</p>
<p>
In other words, this was a planned shutdown that was the result
of an operating system reconfiguration.
Perhaps somebody changed a system setting in the Control Panel,
and in response to the question
“The change you made requires that the system be restarted.
Restart now?”, the person said Yes.</p>
