<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What’s the difference between the hotkeys <kbd>F6</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd>?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, <a href="https://devblogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180918-00/?p=99765"> I listed some of the historical system hotkeys</a>, and I noted that of the ones on the list, only <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> are still around.</p>
<p>You’re probably familiar with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>. It’s the hotkey for closing the current window. The <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> hotkey is not as well known. It’s the hotkey for switching among windows within an application.</p>
<p>But what kind of “switching among windows within an application” are we talking about? Many programs use <kbd>F6</kbd> or even <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> for switching windows.</p>
<p>More specifically, the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> hotkey is for switching among <i>top-level</i> windows in an application. For example, start Notepad, type some text, and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to call up the search dialog. At this point, you can use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> to switch between the search dialog and the main Notepad window.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what it used to do. <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/disks/pcx86/windows/win95/4.00.950/"> You can try it yourself on Windows 95</a>. But it doesn’t seem to work in Windows 10. Not sure if that’s a bug or a feature.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s what <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> was for.</p>
<p>One related hotkey <kbd>F6</kbd> is not a system hotkey, but it is a common application convention for switching among sections of a window, or more generally, between sections of an application. For example, in most Web browsers, the <kbd>F6</kbd> hotkey moves between the address bar and the Web page.</p>
<p>Another related hotkey <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> is also not a system hotkey. It is a common application convention for switching among documents within a single window. In the old days, these were <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winmsg/about-the-multiple-document-interface"> Multiple Document Interface</a> windows, but nowadays they are more likely to be tabbed windows.</p>
<p>That’s the rundown of <kbd>F6</kbd>-related hotkeys. Only <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd> is a system hotkey. The others are application-defined hotkeys, but most applications use them for navigating within the main application window.</p>
