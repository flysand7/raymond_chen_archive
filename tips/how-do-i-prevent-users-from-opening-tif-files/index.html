<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I prevent users from opening TIF files?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer had a question about their Windows XP installations.
(This question was from several years ago, so the fine details
aren’t really relevant any more, but I’m actually telling this
story for a commentary opportunity.)
</p>
<p>
The customer wanted to disable all file associations for TIFF files.
Their first attempt was by deleting <code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.tif</code>
and
<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.tiff</code>.
This successfully renders TIFF files with a generic document icon,
but when the user double-clicks the file, the registration is
re-established and Windows Picture and
Fax Viewer opens the file.
</p>
<p>
The company had some
strange company security policy that says that TIFF files
should not have any file association. I don’t know the rationale
behind it, but they did say that they only needed to block
the default file association.
If the user explicitly creates a new association via the <i>Open With</i>
dialog, then that is not covered by the policy.
</p>
<p>
Deleting the registrations doesn’t work because Windows XP
has an autorepair feature for certain commonly-corrupted file
associations,
and TIFF is one of them.
If the TIFF registration is corrupted and the user is a member
of the Administrators group, then Windows XP will restore
the default association.
(If the user is not a member of the Administrators group,
then the usual “Windows cannot open this file” dialog box appears.)
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the solution to the customer’s odd problem is not to
delete the TIFF registrations (which causes them to be
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/30/169757.aspx">
detected as corrupted</a>)
but rather to simply set a new default handler for TIFF files
that merely displays a message to the user.
If you’re willing to use the Windows Script Host,
then it’s a one-line program:
</p>
<pre>
WScript.Echo("TIFF file associations are disabled.")
</pre>
<p>
If you have been reading carefully,
you have already noticed a serious problem with the customer’s
configuration:
The fact that they are seeing the TIFF autorepair code kicking in
means that they are letting their employees run with Administrator
privileges,
which means that their so-called “security requirement” is like
worrying about employees being able to sneak into the building
through a ventilation grating,
when you give everybody a key to the front door.</p>
