<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is this vmmem program that is using up all my CPU and memory?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Say you’re minding your own business and you discover that this process called <code>vmmem</code> is using up all your memory and CPU. What is this guy and how do you make him stop? </p>
<p>The <code>vmmem</code> process is a virtual process that the system synthesizes to represent the memory and CPU resources consumed by your virtual machines. In other words, if you see <code>vmmem</code> consuming a lot of memory and CPU resources, then that means your virtual machines are consuming a lot of memory and CPU resources. </p>
<p>If you want to make it stop, shut down your virtual machines. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: Strictly speaking, what it actually represents is the resources of the <i>other</i> virtual machines, since Windows itself is running in a virtual machine under the hypervisor. You may not be explicitly using the hypervisor, but <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180130-00/?p=97925">some other features are built on top of the hypervisor</a>. </p>
