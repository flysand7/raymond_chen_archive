<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does Outlook use a semicolon to separate multiple recipients by default?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Microsoft Outlook by default uses a semicolon to separate multiple recipients. <a href="http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/outlook/1649-outlook-allow-comma-as-address-separator.html">You can change this to a comma</a>, but why is the semicolon the default? </p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook was originally positioned as a business product, and many businesses complained that the use of a comma as a separator created havoc because they have a policy of setting names in the address book as “Last, First”. </p>
<p>In 2000, the Outlook folks tried to change the default, but the outcry from corporations made them go back to having the semicolon be the default separator. </p>
<p>Besides, there are a lot of people who have commas in their names, such as <a href="http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/">Martin Luther King, Jr</a>. </p>
