<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">All sorts of bad things happen when we disable the Task Scheduler service, is that bad?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer disabled the Task Scheduler service by applying group policy to set Task Scheduler’s startup mode to <i>Off</i>. When they did that, they found that a lot of stuff stopped working. For example, the Start menu would hang for several minutes. Search stopped working. “Any idea what tasks could be causing the issue?” </p>
<p>The customer liaison added “Obviously this is a bad idea, but I couldn’t find any official statement to that effect.” </p>
<p>Aha, the customer is looking for documentation that  <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj643252.aspx">explicitly states that a bad idea is a bad idea</a>, presumably because they want to shift the blame for their bad idea to Microsoft. </p>
<p>We responded that a bad idea is a bad idea, even if it’s not written down anywhere. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the customer liaison was able to find official documentation that confirmed that a bad idea is a bad idea! </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-services/security-guidelines-for-disabling-system-services-in-windows-server">Guidance on disabling system services on Windows Server 2016 with Desktop Experience</a> lists a bunch of services and what Microsoft has to say about disabling that service. </p>

<p>Each service on the system is categorized as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Should Disable</b>:     A security-focused enterprise will most likely     prefer to disable this service and forego its functionality     (see additional details below).</li>
<li><b>OK to Disable</b>:     This service provides functionality     that is useful to some but not all enterprises,     and security-focused enterprises that don’t use it     can safely disable it.</li>
<li><b>Do Not Disable</b>:     Disabling this service will impact essential functionality     or prevent specific roles or features from functioning correctly.     Therefore it should not be disabled.</li>
<li><b>(No guidance)</b>:     The impact of disabling these services has not been fully evaluated.     Therefore, the default configuration of these services     <u>should not be changed</u>.</li>
</ul>
