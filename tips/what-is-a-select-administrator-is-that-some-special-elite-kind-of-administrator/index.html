<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">What is a “Select Administrator”? Is that some special elite kind of administrator?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer wanted to know why, when they opened a command prompt, the title was “Select Administrator”.</p>

<p>What is a “Select Administrator”? Is that some special elite kind of administrator?</p>
<p>No, that’s not what “Select Administrator” is saying.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s not even “Select Administrator”.</p>
<p>The clue is the white box in the command prompt window that the customer included in the screen shot.</p>
<p>That white box is evidence that the user clicked in the command prompt window with the mouse and initiated a selection. When a selection is active, the word “Select” is added to the front of the title.</p>
<p>What we really have is two unrelated adornments. One for selection, and another for elevation.</p>

<p>The customer noted that they get this “Select Administrator” only when they launch the command prompt a certain way from a specific program. My guess is that the customer is double-clicking something that launches the command prompt on a single click. The command prompt appears after the first click, and the second click goes to the command prompt and triggers the selection.</p>
<p>So the solution is to single-click, not double-click. If you double-click by mistake, you can hit <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit selection mode.</p>
