<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do you undo Minimize All and Show Desktop?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>It seems it’s not well-known how to undo a Minimize All or a  Show Desktop,  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/27/143042.aspx">  two operations which I discussed briefly yesterday</a>.
  To undo a Minimize All, you can right-click the taskbar and select  “Undo Minimize All”, or at least you used to be able to do that.  Minimize All is no longer on the menus, presumably because it ended  up redundant with Show Desktop.
  So after you do your  <font face="Wingdings">ÿ</font>+M to Minimize All,  you can type  <font face="Wingdings">ÿ</font>+Shift+M to Undo Minimize All.</p>
<p>  To undo a Show Desktop, just click Show Desktop again.  If you used the keyboard accelerator  <font face="Wingdings">ÿ</font>+D, just press it a second time.  </p>
