<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">You can filter the Common File dialog with wildcards</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer reported an apparent inconsistency in the shell common file dialogs:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The question mark appears to be treated differently from other invalid file name characters. I tried to save a file in Paint under the name <code>?.jpg</code> but instead of telling me that I had an invalid character in the file name (as it does with other characters like <code>/</code> <code>&lt;</code> and <code>|</code>) or navigating to a new folder (like <code>\</code> or <code>*</code>), it appears to do nothing. </p></blockquote>
<p> Actually, it did do something. You just couldn’t tell because the result of that something was the same as doing nothing.
 If you type a wildcard like <code>?</code> or <code>*</code> into a common file dialog, the dialog interprets this as a request to filter the list of files to those which match the wildcard you specify. In this particular example, typing <code>?.jpg</code> says “Show me all the single-character files with the <code>.jpg</code> extension.” From the description in the original report, I gather that the customer’s tests took place in an empty directory (so the filter had no effect).</p>
<p> The customer responded with muted surprise. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Hmmmmm…..interesting. I hadn’t realized you can type in your own filter in dialog boxes. How long has this feature existed? </p></blockquote>
<p> The ability to filter the common file dialog has been around since the dialogs were introduced in Windows 3.1. </p>
