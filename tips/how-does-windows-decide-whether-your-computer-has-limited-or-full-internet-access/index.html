<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does Windows decide whether your computer has limited or full Internet access?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Windows lets you know when your computer’s Internet connection is limited or absent entirely. What is this sorcery?</p>
<p>Windows attempts to download a file from a dedicated Web server. Depending on which version of Windows, it’s <code>http://www.msftncsi.com/<wbr/>ncsi.txt</code> or <code>http://www.msftconnecttest.com/<wbr/>connecttest.txt</code>. If the download is successful and contains the correct contents, then Windows concludes that you have full Internet access.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong, Windows will report either limited or no Internet access, depending on what exactly went wrong.</p>
