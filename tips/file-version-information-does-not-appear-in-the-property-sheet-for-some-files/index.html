<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">File version information does not appear in the property sheet for some files</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
A customer reported that file version information
does not appear on the Details page of the property sheet
which appears when you right-click the file and select
<i>Properties</i>.
They reported that the problem began in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
The reason that the file version information was not appearing
is that the file’s extension was <code>.xyz</code>.
Older versions of Windows attempted to extract file version information
for all files regardless of type.
I believe it was Windows Vista that changed this behavior
and extracted version information only for known file types
for Win32 modules,
specifically
<code>.cpl</code>,
<code>.dll</code>,
<code>.exe</code>,
<code>.ocx</code>,
<code>.rll</code>,
and
<code>.sys</code>.
If the file’s extension is not on the list above,
then the shell will not sniff for version information.
</p>
<p>
If you want to register a file type as eligible for file version
extraction, you can add the following registry key:
</p>
<pre>
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \Software
  \Microsoft
    \Windows
      \CurrentVersion
        \PropertySystem
          \PropertyHandlers
            \<i>.XYZ</i></b>
             (Default) = REG_SZ:"{66742402-F9B9-11D1-A202-0000F81FEDEE}"
</pre>
<p>
(Thanks in advance for complaining about this change in behavior.
This always happens whenever I post in the Tips/Support
category about how to deal with a bad situation.
Maybe I should stop trying to explain how to deal with bad situations.)</p>
