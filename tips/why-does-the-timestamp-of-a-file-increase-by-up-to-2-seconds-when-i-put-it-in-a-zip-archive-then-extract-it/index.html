<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why does the timestamp of a file increase by up to 2 seconds when I put it in a ZIP archive, then extract it?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>We saw some time ago that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/03/10554551.aspx">the timestamp of a file increases by up to 2 seconds when you copy it to a USB thumb drive</a>. The underlying reason is that USB thumb drives tend to be formatted with the FAT file system, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/26/80492.aspx">the FAT file system records timestamps in local time to only two-second resolution</a>. </p>
<p>The same logic applies to ZIP archives. The ZIP archive format records file times in MS-DOS format, so it too is subject to the two-second resolution limitation. </p>
<p>And the reason the time <i>increases</i> to the nearest two-second interval rather than rounding is so that files do not go backward in time. This is useful when you freshen a ZIP archive: If the file time went backward, then the freshen operation would always report that there were files that needed to be updated. </p>
<p>From the point of view of time stamps, the ZIP archive acts like a tiny FAT-formatted USB thumb drive. </p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: If you want to copy files whose timestamps are newer, but take into account MS-DOS timestamp rounding, you can use the <code>robocopy</code> command with the <code>/FFT</code> command line options. </p>
