<p>When you view a folder for the first time, Explorer arranges the items in a nice default pattern. And when items are added to the folder, they get added to the end. And when you delete an item from the folder… the other items auto-arrange to close the gap? But wait, if you look at the View options, the Auto-Arrange option is not set.</p>
<p> So are we auto-arranging or not auto-arranging? </p>
<p> Well, yes, but only until you touch it. </p>
<p> As long as you express no interest in the placement of icons in a folder (and the desktop counts as a folder), then Explorer will auto-arrange them. But once you move an icon around, Explorer will turn off its double secret auto-arrangement and leave the icon arrangement to you. </p>
<p> (Programmatically, this mode is known as <code>LVS_EX_AUTOAUTOARRANGE</code>.) </p>
