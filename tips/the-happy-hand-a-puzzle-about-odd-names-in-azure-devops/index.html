<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">The happy hand: A puzzle about odd names in Azure DevOps</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A customer found that some word on Azure DevOps were being mysteriously changed to something odd, and a little cute. The table of contents on their wiki page was named “Happy”:</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>Happy</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Contoso?</li>
<li>Getting Started</li>
<li>To Learn More</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And when they went to look at their branches, the main branch was renamed to “hand”:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p><span id="p20211012_br"></span> hand</p></blockquote>
<p>Did they get pranked?</p>
<p>Somebody pointed out that the suspicious substitutions followed a pattern:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="cp3" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>French</th>
<th>English</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>contents</td>
<td>happy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>main</td>
<td>hand</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both of the suspiciously-substituted words happen to be valid words in French, and the corresponding meaning in English is what they got replaced with.</p>
<p>Further investigation showed that something about this particular repo causes the Web browser to think that their Azure DevOps repo pages are written in French, and it offers to auto-translate to English. The customer must have clicked “Yes” by mistake at some point.</p>
<p>Turning off auto-translation fixed the problem.</p>
<p>The customer added, “I sort of liked the names Happy and Hand. Maybe I’ll toggle it back on from time to time when I need a pick-me-up.”</p>
