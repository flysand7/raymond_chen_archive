<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I get a window back on the screen when it moved far, far away?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Commenter Aggravated notes that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#556833"> some programs remember their location when the window is closed and restore to that location when the window is reopened, even if that position is off the screen</a>. These programs clearly were using <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/12/54896.aspx"> screen coordinates instead of workspace coordinates</a> to save and restore the window.</p>
<p> Okay, so you’ve got a program that restored its window position incorrectly and ended up putting it off the screen. Now what do you do? </p>
<p> The keyboard interface comes to the rescue. </p>
<p> Switch to the application, say by clicking on its taskbar button or by Alt+Tab’ing to it. Then type Alt+Space to call up the System menu: You should get a window floating at the edge of the screen. Type M to select <u>M</u>ove, then press an arrow key to enter Move mode. (Doesn’t matter which.) </p>
<p> At this point, you could stick with the keyboard motif and hold down the appropriate arrow key to move the window back onto the screen. Or you can pull a little magic trick: Wave the mouse around. Boom, the window leaps to the mouse <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/09/449438.aspx"> like one of those cheapo magic tricks where something leaps into your hand</a>. </p>
<p> I’m like 95% sure they use string. But it could be magic. No, I’m going with the string. </p>
