<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Quotation marks around spaces aren't necessary in the PATH environment variable</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The purpose of quotation marks is to allow a character that would normally be interpreted as a delimiter to be included as part of a file name. Most of the time, this delimiter is the space. The <code>CreateProcess</code> function uses a space to separate the program name from its arguments. Most programs separate their command line arguments with a space. But the <code>PATH</code> environment variable doesn’t use spaces to separate directories. It uses semicolons.
 This means that if you want to add a directory with spaces in its name to the path, you don’t need quotation marks since spaces mean nothing to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. The quotation marks don’t hurt, mind you, but they don’t help either.</p>
<p> On the other hand, if the directory you want to add contains a semicolon in its name, then you do need the quotation marks, because it’s the semicolon that you need to protect. </p>
