<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I log on using a dial-up connection on Windows Vista?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Mike Stephens from the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy/">Group Policy Team Blog</a> explains <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/grouppolicy/archive/2007/07/30/where-is-logon-using-dial-up-connections-in-windows-vista.aspx"> how to get “Log on using dial-up connections” working on Windows Vista</a>.
 But I’m posting to respond to a comment on that page, since that falls under the category of “When people ask for security holes as features.”</p>

<p> The implied request is that non-administrative users be allowed to  create dial-up connections that can be used for logging on. This request falls into the category of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/When+people+ask+for+security+holes+as+features/default.aspx"> <i>When people ask for security holes as features</i></a>; in this case, it’s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/25/723428.aspx"> repudiation security vulnerability</a>. Here’s how.
 A non-administrative user creates a dial-up networking connectoid and marks it as available for use during logon. For the phone number, the non-administrative user uses a voting number for a television reality show, one that charges $2 per call. (If you are more mercenary, you can arrange to set up a phone number that charges $50/minute and agree to split the profits.) The non-administrative user then logs off and waits.
 When the show starts, the non-administrative user then goes up to the computer and <i>instead of logging on normally</i>, goes to the dial-up connection button and selects the dial-up connectoid. The non-administrative user then proceeds to make dozens of failed logon attempts with that connectoid, under bogus user names like <i><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18014242/">Sanjaya</a>Rocks</i> or <i><a href="http://www.williamhung.net/">WilliamHung</a>4Ever</i>. Each failed logon attempt casts a vote for the contestant, and (here’s the important part) <i>since nobody is actually logged on, you can’t prove who made the calls</i>.
 Some time later, the non-administrative user logs on and deletes the dial-up networking connectoid, to clean up afterward.</p>
<p> The next month, the system administrator gets the phone bill and sees $100 worth of calls to the television show. The system administrator goes to the audit logs to see who made those calls, only to find that they were made by <i>nobody</i>. Even if the system administrator finds the logs for the non-administrative user having created and subsequently deleted the offending dial-up networking connectoid, that’s just circumstantial evidence. “I created those for fun, as a joke. I never actually used them. It must’ve been just somebody walking past the machine who saw that they could use it to vote for Sanjaya.” </p>
