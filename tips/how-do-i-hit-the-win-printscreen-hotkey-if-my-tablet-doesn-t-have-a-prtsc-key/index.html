<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">How do I hit the Win+PrintScreen hotkey if my tablet doesn't have a PrtSc key?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Windows 8 added a new hotkey: <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>PrtSc</kbd> takes a snapshot of your screen and puts it into the Screenshots folder of your Pictures library. But what if you are on a tablet with no PrtSc key? </p>
<p> On tablets, you can perform the same operation by pressing Windows button + Volume down. Both of these are the hardware buttons on the tablet, not on any keyboard. </p>
