<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Why do my file properties sometimes show an Archive check box and sometimes an Advanced button?</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>When you view the properties of a file and go to the General page, there are some check boxes at the bottom for file attributes. There’s one for <i>Read-only</i> and one for <i>Hidden</i>, and then it gets weird. Sometimes you get <i>Archive</i> and sometimes you get an <i>Advanced</i> button. What controls which one you get?</p>
<p> It depends on whether there is anything interesting in the Advanced dialog. </p>
<p> If the volume supports either compression or encryption (or both), then you will get an <i>Advanced</i> dialog with check boxes for <i>Archive</i>, <i>Compress</i> and <i>Encrypt</i>. On the other hand, if the volume supports neither compression nor encryption, then you will just get an <i>Archive</i> check box, since it looks kind of silly having an <i>Advanced</i> button that shows you a dialog box with just one check box on it. (Note that these features can also be disabled by group policy, so it’s not purely a file system decision.) </p>
<p> In Windows, the most commonly encountered file system that does not support compression or encryption is probably FAT, and the most commonly encountered one that does is almost certainly NTFS, so in a rough sense, you can say that FAT gives you an <i>Archive</i> check box and NTFS gives you an <i>Advanced</i> button. </p>
