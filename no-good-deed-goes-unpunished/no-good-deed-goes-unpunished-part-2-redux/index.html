<p> I noted some time ago that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/19/844008.aspx"> I have taken to “blaming” Exchange when someone assumes that my reply to a thread on a distribution list implies that I have taken responsibility for resolving their problem</a>. One of my colleagues in another group is in a similar situation with respect to a different product, and he has taken to using the same basic formulation when sending issues back to the distribution list. </p>
<p> One variation he used a while back gave me a chuckle: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We need a new Exchange server.  This one keeps stripping the mailing list. </p></blockquote>
