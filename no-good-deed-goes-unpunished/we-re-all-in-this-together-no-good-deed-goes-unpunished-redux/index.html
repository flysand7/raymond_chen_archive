<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">We're all in this together: No good deed goes unpunished, redux</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>There were several suggestions as to how I could avoid <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/26/584125.aspx"> being tagged as the owner of an issue because I helped route the problem</a>. Many of them involved assigning the bug back to the testers to “teach them a lesson”.
 Punishing the tester doesn’t help the product.
 Remember, we’re all in this together. The goal is to fix bugs and ship a quality product.† Being vindictive doesn’t further that goal. Especially <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/26/584125.aspx#584171"> one suggestion</a> which was to resolve the bug as “Won’t fix” with the reason “Tester is an idiot.” That may make you feel better, but it is a total disservice to your customers.
 It’s almost certainly a sign of dysfunction in a product when the team members spend more time sniping at each other than they do actually working on the product. It’s a team effort. Let’s try to act like a team.</p>
