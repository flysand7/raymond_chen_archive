<p> Today’s Microspeak is the word <i>calibration</i>. It used to mean the act of adjusting a piece of measuring equipment against a known standard so that it can perform its job accurately. For example, before <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/23/1935433.aspx"> reading student essays</a>, I go through a calibration exercise, wherein all the readers are given a handful of essays of varying quality and discuss what grade each one deserves so that our scores will be consistent with each other.†
 And then I see the word used in a way that convinces me that I don’t know what it means any more. Consider this sentence: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I would like to get calibration on that individual from those who know him. </p></blockquote>
<p> How do you “get calibration”? What is this person trying to say, and why won’t he use plain English?
 <b>Nitpicker’s corner</b></p>
<p> †s/consistent/more consistent/. Obviously, since there is a human element involved, the scores cannot be absolutely consistent. </p>
