<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Offline (noun)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Sure, any noun can be verbed, and any verb can be nouned. But today, we’re going to noun an adjective.
 I have no written citations of this usage; the only report was via a colleague who overheard it in a hallway conversion.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I had some offlines with Fred about that. </p></blockquote>
<p> In Microspeak, <i>offline</i> is an adjective which means “outside this meeting.” In order to keep a meeting on track, the meeting organizer may advise the people engaged in the discussion of a side topic or a topic of limited interest to <i>take it offline, please</i>, meaning <i>discuss this amongst yourselves after the meeting, please</i>. In other words, “Let’s not waste valuable meeting time on this topic.”</p>
<p> The above citation converts the adjective <i>offline</i> into a noun, <i>an offline</i> presumably being shorthand for <i>an offline conversation</i> (or other type of communication). The translation would therefore be something like “I had some private conversations with Fred about that.” </p>
