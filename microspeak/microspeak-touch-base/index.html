<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: touch base</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The verb phrase <i>touch base</i> is <a href="http://businessguysonbusinesstrips.com/?page_id=173"> in general business jargon use</a>, but it’s quite popular at Microsoft. </p>
<p> To <i>touch base</i> with someone is to contact someone in a lightweight and mostly-informal sort of way. In other words, it takes the form of a piece of email or a brief office visit rather than a formal meeting with an agenda. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Bob, can you touch base with the Nosebleed team to verify that this design change won’t affect them? </p></blockquote>
<p> Bob is expected to contact a representative from the Nosebleed team, either by sending email, or by telephone, or by stopping by their office for a quick chat. If Bob sets up a one-hour meeting with a dozen engineers from both sides, then he’s blowing the issue out of proportion. </p>
