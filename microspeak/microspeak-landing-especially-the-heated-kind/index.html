<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Landing, especially the heated kind</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Work on Windows occurs in several different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(software)"> branches</a> of the source code, and changes in one branch propagate to other branches. When talking about a feature or other task becoming visible in a branch, the preferred jargon word at Microsoft is <i>landing</i>. In its purest form:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We expect the feature to <u>land</u> in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/04/10431671.aspx"> trunk</a> early next week. </p></blockquote>
<p> The term <i>land</i> when used in this way is typically used to describe a feature arriving in a branch different from its home branch.
 From this basic meaning, extended usages arise.</p>
<p> The term <i>landing</i> is often accompanied by additional aviation adjectives to describe how smoothly the feature will arrive or the task will be completed. In these extended usages, the location of landing is often the feature’s home branch. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We’re coming in for a <u>hard landing</u> on bugs. </p></blockquote>
<p> A <i>hard landing</i> is one that is rather inelegant. An example would be a feature that arrives fully functional but rather unpolished, or in the above example, that the bugs are all resolved, but perhaps with more bugs marked <i>Won’t fix</i> or <i>Postponed</i> than management would have liked. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The feature is going to <u>land hot</u>. </p></blockquote>
<p> A feature with a <i>hot landing</i> barely makes its deadline. You can also say that a feature is <i>coming in hot</i> if it is headed for a hot landing, and a feature is <i>running hot</i> if its current trajectory suggests that it’s going to land hot. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The last thing that <u>came in hot</u> was Feature X and we did not <u>land</u> it well. </p></blockquote>
<p> I like the above citation because it employs both metaphors. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We did not have a good process in place for managing the specs that <u>came in hot</u>. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Several deployments are <u>coming in hot</u> due to other resource commitments. </p></blockquote>
<p> More generally, something is <i>coming in hot</i> if it is running right up against a deadline and is at risk for being late. </p>
