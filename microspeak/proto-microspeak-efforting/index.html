<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Proto-Microspeak: Efforting</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I have only two citations, so it may not be proper Microspeak.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We’re efforting that for you. </p></blockquote>
<p> They’re not just trying, they’re <i>efforting</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Solution efforting seems to fall in a gap between teams so there’s no clear owner or resourcing focused on it. </p></blockquote>
<p> Bonus jargon: <i>resourcing</i>. Actually, that one sentence came from a longer document packed with management-speak. Here’s another beauty from that longer document: “A lot of effort goes into availing efficient systems to streamline incident handle time.” Of course, what the person really meant to write was “A lot of <u>efforting</u>…”
 It appears that <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5571735"> the term has been heard around the NPR offices as well</a>.</p>
<p> My local social circle has started using the term mockingly. “The Foo object efforts the destruction of the Bar object.” </p>
