<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Click stop</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A term that is beginning to gain currency at Microsoft is <i>click stop</i>. Here are a few citations. See if you can figure it out.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Document title: Features Available at Click Stop 1</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Components should view mode X as a click stop toward switching to mode Y.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>We have decided to have a click stop at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"> MVP</a> and another after all Priority 1 features are complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its most general sense, a <i>click stop</i> is a reference point in an otherwise continuous range.</p>
<p>It derives from the photography term which describes detents on a camera lens aperture dial. Although you can set the aperture to any value you like, the notches make it easier to set the aperture to one of a handful of commonly-used values.</p>
<p>In Microspeak, the term is usually used to refer to points in the development of a software product. These key moments are a time to pause and reflect, taking time to assess the state of the product more thoroughly.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s a fancy synonym for <i>milestone</i>.</p>
<p>Although that is the original intended meaning of the term <i>click stop</i>, that didn’t stop the term from being used in other completely different ways. I suspect that what happened is that the term was coined spontaneously by some senior executive who was a photography enthusiast, and everybody was afraid to ask what it meant, so each person came away with their own idea of its definition. I’ve noted earlier that a nontrivial source of Microspeak is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080826-00/?p=21093"> the desire to impress upper management</a>. Everybody wants to use the term, even if they don’t know what it means.</p>
<p>These mutated versions of the term <i>click stop</i> are never defined in the documents they are found in. Defining the term would betray that you aren’t “hip” and “with-it”. You just throw the term out there and hope it makes you sound like senior management material.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Click Stop 2 is defined as users in markets where feature X is not available. Users can also end up in this Click Stop if the feature has been disabled by Group Policy. Users can be in Click Stop 2 and Click Stop 4 at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>This document thinks that a <i>click stop</i> is a way of categorizing different types of users, and that click stops can overlap. This doesn’t mesh well with the original <i>aperture dial detent</i> sense of <i>click stop</i>; you can’t set a dial to two values at the same time.</p>
<p>But that never stopped them.</p>
<p>Some sort of prize needs to be awarded to the author of this sentence which I found in a different document:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Industry adoption of feature X will move us toward our <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151103-00/?p=91861"> North Star</a> click stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being able to incorporate multiple Microspeak terms into a single sentence proves that you’re ready to be promoted to senior management.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: One of my colleagues thinks that <i>North Star Click Stop</i> sounds like the name of a great Seattle gastropub.</p>
