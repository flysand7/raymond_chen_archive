<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Sit in it!</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The title of this entry is a bad pun on <a href="http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/happydays.htm"> a catchphrase from 1970s television</a>. I apologize to those for whom the 1970s are a bad memory.
 A snippet of Microspeak that bothers me is the verb phrase “to sit in”.
 Example: “I’m in the Nosebleed group which sits in Bob Smith’s organization.”</p>
<p> I think it means “to be a part of” but I’m not quite sure. Maybe it just means that they’re there temporarily until they can find a more permanent “seating assignment.” </p>
