<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: All-up</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>
Here are some citations.
Let’s see if we can figure out what it means.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I think a presentation of these results would be a fun boost for the team.
Is this something we should handle in a bunch of teams’
weekly meetings,
or should we do something <i>all up</i>?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the first citation, <i>all up</i> appears to mean
“with everybody all together.”
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We’re looking for an <i>all-up</i> view
of the various compatibility mitigations we have related to this feature.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the second citation, <i>all up</i> could mean
“overview” or “detailed summary”.
Not sure yet.
Let’s keep looking.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
From the <i>all up</i> performance effort,
we’ve settled on the approach below.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Okay, this seems to suggest that
<i>all up</i> refers to an aggregation of individual items.
Let’s try again:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
We have a number of channels for disseminating information.
I think an all up destination could play a key and proactive role
in major announcements such as the one from last week.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here, <i>all up</i> appears to mean
“consolidated, comprehensive”.
Let’s keep going.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
Document title: XYZ <i>All Up</i> Glossary
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This document is a glossary.
Presumably is a glossary of terms you may encounter throughout
the entire XYZ project.
One last citation,
this from a status report:
</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<ul>
<li>This week: Created Customer <i>All up</i> report.
<li>Next week: Update Customer <i>all up</i> report with more customer
    related information.
</li></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, this didn’t actually tell me much about what
an <i>all up</i> report is,
which is kind of a bummer because I was asked to create an
<i>all up report</i>,
and I still don’t know if what I created is what the person wanted.
</p>
<p>
(I ended up creating a report that summarized the status of
every team,
and called out issues that were noteworthy or reasons for concern.
The person who asked for the report didn’t complain,
so I guess that was close enough to what they wanted that they
didn’t bother asking for more.)</p>
