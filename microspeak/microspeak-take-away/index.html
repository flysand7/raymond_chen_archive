<p>At Microsoft, the <i>take-away</i> is the essential message of a presentation or the conclusion that you are expected to draw from a situation. It is something you are expected to remember when the whole thing is over, a piece of information you <i>take away with you</i> as you leave the room.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>XYZ demo take away</b> (title of a document) </p></blockquote>
<p> The preferred intensifier is <i>key</i>, and you probably see it attached to the phrase <i>take-away</i> more often than not. This example comes from a presentation on the results of a user study:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Results: XYZ Tough to Use</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>… </li>
<li>Key take-away:     
<ul>
<li>Migration to XYZ will be difficult     </li>
<li>Need to show value of using the power of DEF     </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> In fact, every single slide in this presentation had a bullet point at the bottom called <i>Key take-away</i>. (And, as you may have noticed, the heading is the singular <i>take-away</i> even though multiple take-aways were listed.)
 Another use of the term <i>take-away</i> follows in the same spirit as the “essential message” usage, but the idea of “taking away” is taken literally: A <i>take-away</i> is a small information card that sales and marketing people give to potential customers. Think of it as the business card for a service rather than for a person.</p>
