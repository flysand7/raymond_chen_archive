<p>In his reddit AMA, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/pacificnw/2008177548_pacificpendgame14.html"> Joe Belfiore</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/24jtcy/hi_im_joe_belfiore_from_the_windows_phone_team_ama/ch7vtqx%22"> wrote</a></p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> i have regular 1-1 meetings with my counterparts in Office, Skype, Xbox. </p></blockquote>
<p> The little bit of jargon there is <i>1-1 meeting</i>. This is an abbreviation for <i>one-on-one meeting</i>, a common business practice wherein two people, typically <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/11/11/the-secret-to-effective-one-on-one-meetings-with-direct-reports/"> a manager and a direct report</a>, have a face-to-face meeting with no one else present. In the case Joe used, the meeting is not between a manager and a direct report but between two peers.
 The term is also abbreviated <i>1:1</i>, which like <i>1 − 1</i> also looks like a bit of mathematical nonsense. But it’s not zero or one. It’s just an abbreviation for business jargon.
 Of course, Microspeak isn’t happy with the abbreviation as-is. Microspeak takes it further and nounifies the abbreviation. “I’ll bring that up in my 1–1 with Bob tomorrow” means “I’ll bring that up in my one-on-one meeting with Bob tomorrow.”</p>
<p> Note that the abbreviation <i>OOO</i> is not used to mean <i>one-on-one</i>. That abbreviation is used to mean <i>Out of the office</i>, although it is more commonly abbreviated <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/archive/2003/09/25/53795.aspx"> OOF</a> at Microsoft. </p>
