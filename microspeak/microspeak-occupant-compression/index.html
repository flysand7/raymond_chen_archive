<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Occupant compression</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>This is not so much Microspeak as it is <i>Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities</i>-speak. The following notice was displayed in one of the buildings: </p>
<blockquote class="q" style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1ex">
<p>Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities will be converting lab 1234 to a team space. The new space will ease occupant compression. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occupant compression? Ouch, that sounds painful. </p>
<p>The term <i>compression</i> appears to be an actual term of art in the Real Estate and Facilities department. I found a presentation that was rich in citations. </p>
<blockquote class="q" style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1ex">
<p>Power/HVAC programming in per seat basis at #### W/SC results in risk given observed <i>compression</i> behavior. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q" style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1ex">
<p>We determined the frequency and magnitude that teams in neighborhood spaces <i>compress</i>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q" style="border: solid 1px black;padding: 1ex">
<p>Some neighborhoods always <i>compress</i> regardless of loading, likely caused by business drivers for proximity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can gather, <i>compression</i> is the term used to describe how close together people’s workspaces are. </p>
