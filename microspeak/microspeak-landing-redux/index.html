<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: landing (redux)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In a meeting, my colleague <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/martynl/">Martyn Lovell</a> said, “The plan is shifting and hasn’t landed anywhere yet.” </p>
<p>This was generally understood to mean “The plan is shifting and the issue is not yet settled.” </p>
<p>I don’t know if this is true Microspeak, or Martyn was just making up a little metaphor on the fly. But I filed it away anyway because of the interesting collision with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/16/10434390.aspx">another Microspeak use of the word <i>landing</i></a>. </p>
