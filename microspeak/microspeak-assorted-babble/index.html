<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Assorted babble</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Here are some phrases I jotted down during a meeting. I don’t even know what meeting it was. (They were jotted on some scratch paper.) These don’t count so much as Microspeak as they do just assorted management babble. </p>
<ul>
<li>“inspiring sustained high performance” </li>
<li>“fostering agility and resilience” </li>
<li>“clarifying the journey” </li>
<li>“unleashing talent” </li>
<li>“a new or unanticipated experiment” </li>
</ul>
<p> Sometimes I wish management would speak in plain English. But then the rest of us might realize that they don’t know what they’re talking about. </p>
