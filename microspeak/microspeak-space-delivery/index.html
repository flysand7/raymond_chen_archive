<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Space delivery</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> As I noted in an earlier entry of Microspeak, the real estate department here has their own weird jargon. Today’s phrase is “delivering space”: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Listed below is the schedule for delivery of space over the next twelve months. </p></blockquote>
<p> Translation: “Listed below is the schedule for when new office space will become ready for use over the next twelve months.” </p>
