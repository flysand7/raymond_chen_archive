<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: FMLA</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If you leave your computer unattended and logged in, especially if you work on the security team, you may come back to your office to find that somebody used your computer to sent email out to the entire team with the subject line FMLA.
 FMLA stands for “Fire my lame anterior” (except with another word for anterior).</p>
<p> The implication is that somebody who left their computer unattended and logged in has left themselves open to an identity theft attack, for the person who sent the email could very well have just sent the email to Bill Gates demanding to be fired. (The victim of this prank is typically somebody new to the team.) </p>
