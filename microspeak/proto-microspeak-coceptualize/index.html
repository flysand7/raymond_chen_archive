<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Proto-Microspeak: Coceptualize</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Many years ago, to see whether anybody was paying attention, a colleague and I slipped the made-up word “coceptualize” into a document.
 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/07/5948256.aspx#5968234"> Nobody said a thing</a>.</p>
<p> Either nobody read that part of the document, or they did and thought it was a real word. </p>
