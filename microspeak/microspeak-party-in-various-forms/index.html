<p>
Remember, Microspeak includes words and phrases in general use,
as long as they are employed at Microsoft at a higher rate than
in the general population,
or in specific situations that may not be obvious to the uninitiated.
They are the words and phrases you need to use in order to fit in.

<p>
Today’s word is <i>party</i>, in various forms,
and usually paired with the preposition <i>on</i>.
In general, it means <i>to use, change, or modify
with few or no constraints</i>.
These aren’t genteel tea parties;
they’re more like
wild college parties,
the kind
that end with the police being called.

<blockquote class="q"><p>
LockBits returns a pointer to the pixel buffer,
and the caller can party on the memory inside
the rectangle until it calls UnlockBits.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
When used with permission verbs like <i>can</i> and
<i>may</i>,
the usage indicates that the component has permission
to read from and write to the memory,
subject to the given constraints.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
The code partied on our data structures because it
used a pointer after freeing it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is often used in a negative sense to indicate
that the component wrote to memory that it should not have.
Sort of an unauthorized party.

<blockquote class="q"><p>
The Contoso notifier injects a DLL into Explorer so it can
party on the internal data that keeps track of
icons in the notification area and thereby disable the
icons of its competitors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
These sorts of unauthorized parties can be malicious and willful
as well as merely accidental.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
The <i>exp</i> branch is a party branch.
You can commit your changes there
so we can test it
before pulling it into the release branch.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The word <i>party</i> can be used to describe an environment
in which the normal rules and constraints are reduced
or removed entirely.
Here, the <i>party branch</i> is presumably
a branch of the project
in which the usual procedures for code changes don’t apply,
or at least apply less strictly than normal.
You can put any experimental changes in the
<i>exp</i> branch,
and then when a new build comes out the next day,
you can run your tests against it to see if they solve
the problem.
If so, then you can start filling out the necessary paperwork
to pull the changes into the release branch.
</p>
<p>
Many release branches have an experimental offshoot.¹
The idea is that people developing fixes to the product
can commit their changes to the experimental branch
to see how they work out.
If the changes look good, they are pulled into
the release branch.
If the changes doesn’t pass muster,
they are rolled back.
The developers who use the experimental branch are on their
honor to keep the branch in good condition.
</p>
<p>
Note that this sense of <i>party</i> is relative.
The experimental branch is a big party compared to the
staid and formal release branch,
but it’s still not a crazy free-for-all.
You still need to be judicious about what you put into the party
branch so you don’t ruin the party for everybody else.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
The Q1 branch is locked down for the beta,
but you can party your post-beta fixes into the Q2 branch.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The above example further highlights the relative nature of the
term <i>party</i>.
Even though the Q2 branch is open to post-beta fixes,
you still have to go through the usual test and review
processes for fixing bugs.
It’s just that Q2 will accept any approved bug fix,
whereas Q1 will accept only fixes for bugs marked
beta-blocking.
</p>
<p>
(That’s a little extra Microspeak for you: <i>blocking</i>.
In Microspeak,
a
<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/ART-20044522">
beta blocker</a>
is not a pharmacological agent.
Rather, it’s something that prevents the beta from being released.)

In Windows, the experimental branch associated with a release
branch is typically called
<i>cbt</i>.
This officially stands for
<i>Central Build Team</i>,
but some people who live in my house
like to joke that it stands for
<i>Can’t Be Trusted</i>.</p>
