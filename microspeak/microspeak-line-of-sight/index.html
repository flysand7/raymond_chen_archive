<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Line of sight</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I first encountered this term in a meeting I attended.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  Q: We would like to be able to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow without requiring a reboot. </p>
<p> A: Yes, that is something we’ve been thinking about, but we don’t have line of sight to having that feature before the end of the month. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> From context, <i>having line of sight</i> to a result means something like “Have made it part of our immediate plans to achieve that result.”
 This appears to be extending the idiom <i>on the horizon</i>. Literally, something <i>on the horizon</i>. is at the edge of what can be seen. Figuratively, then, something that is <i>on the horizon</i> is at the edge of what can be predicted. And if something can be seen, then you have <i>line of sight</i> to it.
 There is another aspect of <i>line of sight</i>: The view to the object must be unobstructed. Taking the analogy further, then, having <i>line of sight</i> to a result means that there is a plan for achieving that result that is not dependent on work from another team.
 Note that I don’t know if the “unobstructed” part of the analogy was intended by the speaker. All I have to work from is that one snippet of conversation.
 In an attempt to obtain better insight into the phrase <i>line of sight</i>, I searched the intranet, and the hits fell into a few categories.
 One category was people using the term literally, usually in the context of wireless communications.
 Another category appeared to use the phrase as a synonym for “insight obtained from information”:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Monthly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_sheet"> tear sheets</a> are improving <i>line of sight</i>. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Teams were empowered to reallocate expenses within discretionary line items, but there was a lack of transparency into these changes. Forecasting was a challenge because we did not have <i>line of sight</i> into these reallocation decisions. We will address this by developing a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/22/10387008.aspx"> pivot</a> tool that provides management a consolidated <i>line of sight</i> into spend by resource. </p></blockquote>
<p> Note also the business jargony use of <i>spend</i> as a noun, meaning <i>expenditure</i>.
 The third category appears to be what I heard in that meeting, where it means something like “a path to a result”:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> XYZ was impacted by ABC and DEF. We have <i>line of sight</i> to get back on track. </p></blockquote>
<p> And then I think I hit the jackpot: Somebody defined the term, sort of.</p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p style="text-align: center"> <b>Line of sight to ending year $XX under budget</b> </p>
<p>  XYZ is at 99% pass, with line of sight to ending the year at 100% pass. ABC is $YY under budget, and is on track to end the year at $XX under budget. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The value $XX was repeated both in the heading and in the body, which let me match the two statements. And one of the statements uses the phrase <i>line of sight</i>, whereas the other uses the more conventional phrase <i>on track</i>.
 I therefore conclude that the two are roughly synonyms. <i>Line of sight to X</i> means <i>on track to X</i>.
 Though this means that one of the citations above translates to “We are on track to get back on track,” which sounds kind of eerily meta.</p>
<p> The preferred emphatic form of <i>line of sight</i> appears to be <i>clear line of sight</i>. </p>
