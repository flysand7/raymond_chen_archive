<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: The forcing function</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> At Microsoft, you’ll hear the phrase “forcing function” and it won’t be in reference to <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/rfpk/training/tutorials/modeling/part8/10.html"> differential equations</a> or to <a href="http://psnet.ahrq.gov/glossary.aspx#F"> user interface design</a>. Rather, it means a set of circumstances that forces a decision to be made or which forces an action to be taken that previously had no hard deadline. </p>
<p> Example: “The impending Y2K threat served as a forcing function for many companies to upgrade their hardware.” </p>
