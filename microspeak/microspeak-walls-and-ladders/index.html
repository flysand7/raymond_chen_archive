<p>Reader laonianren wanted to know more about this game <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/10/10138969.aspx#10139278"> Walls and Ladders</a>.
 “Walls and Ladders” is not a game. It’s just a metaphor for a conflict in which one side wants to perform some action and the other side wants to prevent it. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/26/9445006.aspx"> The defending side builds a wall, and the attacking side builds a taller ladder</a>. In response, the defending side builds a taller wall, and the attacking side builds an even taller ladder. The result of this conflict is that the defending side constructs an ever-more-elaborate wall and the attacking side constructs <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/12/23/duck-sex-competition.html"> a more-and-more complex ladder</a> [link possible NSFW], both sides expending ridiculous amounts of resources and ultimately ending up back where they started.
 There is a closely-related metaphor known as an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/16/73780.aspx"> arms race</a>. In an arms race, each participant wants to be the most <i>X</i>, for some property <i>X</i>. An arms race tends to be all-attack, whereas wall-and-ladders tends to have one side attacking and the other defending.
 Since many conflicts can be phrased either as an attack-attack scenario or an attack-defend scenario (some defenses may include counter-attacks), I tend to get the two confused. Notice, for example, that my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/16/73780.aspx"> arms race</a> article contains mostly walls-and-ladders scenarios; for example, a case where one side wants to terminate a process and another wants to  prevent it from being terminated. On the other hand, my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/10/10138969.aspx"> wall and ladders</a> example was really more of an arms race, with both sides wanting to take control of the screen.</p>
<p> Depending on which group you work with at Microsoft, you may find a preference for <i>walls and ladders</i> over <i>arms race</i>, probably due to the same sensitivity to military terms that led to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/11/9059013.aspx"> <i>War Room</i> being renamed <i>Ship Room</i></a>. (I seem to recall that there was a lawsuit that among other things alleged that the fact that a Microsoft project called its daily meeting room the <i>War Room</i> was proof of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/31/10168424.aspx"> Microsoft’s evil essence</a>.) </p>
