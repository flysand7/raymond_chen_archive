<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: ladder up</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Some time ago, I encountered a new piece of Microsoft jargon. Let’s try to figure it out together. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>For our team presentation, we developed a theme that ties together all of the features we are working on, and how it <i>laddered up</i> to something bigger than the features themselves. </p></blockquote>
<p>I went searching through other documents looking for the phrase “ladder up” in an attempt to triangulate the meaning. Here are some more citations. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>These requirements are documented and <i>ladder up</i> to each other so teams understand how the work is connected. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>I think it’s important because it’s actually these tiny issues that <i>ladder up</i> to my perception about various products. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p><b>Risk</b>: The organization’s strategy keeps changing.<br/><b>Impact</b>: Trying to align experimentation to supply decision         at a specific timeline cannot succeed.<br/><b>Action</b>: Form our own vision of how to ladder up. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>At left are some of the more common <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">pivots</a> we looked at in the data. Things like role, organization type, platform, and technology use. We found the segments <i>laddered up</i> to three main categories identified here. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>The list of potential needs will include the twelve needs currently identified (and which can be <i>laddered up</i> to the four meta needs of “information”, “enrichment”, etc.). </p></blockquote>
<p>Confused yet? Here are some more. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Company X organizes all social conversations with subject code tags, which <i>laddered up</i> to branded campaigns and offerings. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>“Fast” features can be <i>laddered up</i> to a strong emotional benefit which taps into a need. </p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, so there appear to be three general categories of usage. </p>
<p>One sense of <i>ladder up</i> is that of multiple things building upon each other and reinforcing each other, usually building toward a common goal. </p>
<p>Another sense of <i>ladder up</i> is that of organizing a collection of items into a small number of groups. </p>
<p>The third category is the ones that I can’t make any sense of. (“Form our own vision of how to ladder up.” “… laddered up to branded campaigns and offerings.”) </p>
<p>One of my colleagues spent time in marketing and said that the phrase <i>ladder up</i> was used a lot to describe how various campaigns all contributed to a common goal. </p>
<p>So at least in marketing, the <i>ladder up</i> sense is that of building and reinforcement. </p>
<p>It’s not clear how the “organizing into a small number of groups” sense is related to that. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, and the two uses developed independently. Or maybe people heard the phrase <i>ladder up</i> in a marketing presentation and decided to start using it themselves without really understanding what it means. </p>
