<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Pencils down</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I’m particularly fascinated by Microspeak terms which nobody actually knows the meaning of. You can defend jargon by saying that it’s a shorthand way of talking in order to improve communication, but if nobody actually knows what it means, the <i>in order to improve communication</i> part is completely turned on its head. The Microspeak that allegedly allows people to communicate better ends up making them communicate worse.</p>
<p> A colleague of mine introduced me to this new type of Microspeak. Our conversation takes place in an impromptu hallway meeting between the development manager and a few members of the team. </p>
<p> Team member: “What does this mean for our milestone? I’m assuming it means that our features are code complete.” </p>
<p> Development manager: <i>It means you are pencils down.</i> </p>
<p> Team member: (confused) “What does ‘pencils down’ mean?” </p>
<p> <i>— It means your features are done for the milestone.</i> </p>
<p> “Where did that term come from?” </p>
<p> <i>— A meeting with «senior executive».</i> </p>
<p> “Okay, so what does ‘done’ mean?” </p>
<p> <i>— It means you are pencils down.</i> </p>
<p> “What <i>exactly</i> does that mean?” </p>
<p> <i>— It means you don’t have to write any new code for your features.</i> </p>
<p> “Oh, okay. So it means code complete.” </p>
<p> <i>— No, that means something different.</i> </p>
<p> “How are they different?” </p>
<p> <i>— I don’t know.</i> </p>
<p> “Has anyone sent any email defining what ‘pencils down’ means?” </p>
<p> <i>— Not that I know of.</i> </p>
<p> My colleague has yet to find anybody who can provide a definition of the term <i>pencils down</i>. </p>
<p> This sort of confirms <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/22/7843406.aspx#7849205"> what my colleague Michael Grier mentioned in a comment</a>: The intended purpose for this jargon is not to communicate with the people who work for you but to impress the people you work <i>for</i>. </p>
