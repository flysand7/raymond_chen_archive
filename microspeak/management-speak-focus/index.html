<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Management-speak: Focus</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Management likes to use the word <i>focus</i>. They like it so much, that anything important is called a <i>focus</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> That’s an interesting scenario, one which we hope to address, but it’s not our main focus. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We’re focusing on three features for this release. </p></blockquote>
<p> But how can you focus on more than one thing? The first citation implies that there’s more than one focus (a main focus, and maybe some secondary foci); the second citation makes explicit the mutiplicity of foci.
 But a lens doesn’t focus on more than one thing. There is one focus, the point at which parallel rays from infinity converge.</p>
<p> Then again, if a lens is defective, it can have more than one focal point. And there’s a term for that phenomenon: Aberration. </p>
