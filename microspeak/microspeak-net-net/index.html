<p>In finance, the <i>net</i> is the total after you have cancelled positive values against negative values. For example, if you took in $30 and paid out $20, then your net is $10.
 In Microspeak, this term has moved into project planning and has undergone redoubling, so it’s not just <i>net</i>; it’s <i>net net</i>. The doubling of the word was probably added to create a sense of impatience. Here’s an imaginary conversation that illustrates the term:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Speaker 1</b>: We’re five days over on component X,     but component Y is ahead of schedule, and we can have some     of them h… </p>
<p><b>Speaker 2</b>: (interrupting) What’s the <i>net net</i>? </p>
<p><b>Speaker 1</b>: Um, we’re two days behind. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <i>net net</i> is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_lease#Double_net_lease"> a real estate transaction</a> but rather is a short summary of a complicated situation, what often goes by the term <i>bottom line</i>.</p>
<p> Here is an actual citation: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>(At the top of a long email message)</p>
<p>Net net, we’re delaying the release we had planned for tomorrow to try and get some critical fixes in. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Another use of the term <i>net net</i> is to highlight a conclusion from a lot of data. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p>(at the bottom of a large information-dense PowerPoint slide)</p>
<p>Net Net: Eliminate XYZ from our target set. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Both senses of <i>net net</i> highlight the principle of <i>I know you’re impatient, so I’ll cut to the chase</i>. </p>
