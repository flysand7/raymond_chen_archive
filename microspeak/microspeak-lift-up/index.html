<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: lift up</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Today’s Microspeak is the verb phrase “lift up”. Here’s a citation: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>[After a long detailed discussion.] I want to lift up a little and talk about why this is important. </p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t know what this intransitive sense of <i>lift up</i> meant, and there wasn’t too much context here to work from, so I hunted around for other citations. The vast majority of uses were transitive, with the unsurprising meaning of “to raise”. But buried among the results were a few intransitive uses: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>It was useful to sit down and lift the discussion to the Western Europe level, not just the Germany level. This is a good way to lift up to take a broader view. </p></blockquote>
<p>From context, it appears that <i>lift up</i> means “to take a higher-level view”. The next example seems to confirm this sense: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Don’t start by going into detail about the new offering. Lift up a level and start by discussing how the new offering fits the overall strategy. </p></blockquote>
<p>The word <i>level</i> is not a direct object of <i>lift up</i>; it’s telling you how much to lift up, not what to lift up. The implication is that you are lifting <i>yourself</i>: When you <i>lift up</i>, you are taking a higher-level view of the situation to see how the pieces fit together. </p>
<p>The final citation I could find takes a somewhat different approach to the phrase <i>lift up</i>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>A team might be heads-down executing on their plan and can’t lift up to consider what to do next. </p></blockquote>
<p>This contrasts <i>lift up</i> with <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/headsdown.html"><i>heads-down</i></a>,¹ and suggests that the implied direct object is <i>head</i>: The team is so focused on executing their plan that they can’t lift up <i>their heads</i> to consider what to do next. </p>
<p>It appears that <i>lift up</i> means different things depending on context. It could mean to <i>shift the discussion to a higher-level topic</i>, or it could mean to <i>disengage momentarily from an all-consuming task</i>.² </p>
<p>¹ The metaphor for <i>heads-down</i> is students hard at work, hunched over their desk, so that their heads are buried in their books and they are consequently unaware of their surroundings. </p>
<p>² Interestingly, the first and last citations both came from the same person, suggesting more strongly that <i>lift up</i> has multiple valid interpretations, and you need to pick the intended one from context. </p>
