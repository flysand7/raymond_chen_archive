<p>Every year, Microsoft invites its employees to fill out a poll which asks questions regarding all sorts of things. One of the things Microsoft employees are asked to evaluate is whether they think that their vice president is acting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/04/789820.aspx"> <i>planfully</i></a>.
 The tricky part about that question is that nobody knows exactly what the word <i>planfully</i> means.
 Merriam-Webster defines <i>planful</i> as “<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/planful">full of plans : RESOURCEFUL, SCHEMING</a>.” Is that what they’re asking us? Whether our vice president is resourceful and scheming? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
 The OED, on the other hand, defines it as “Full or rich in plans; characterized by planning; organized, systematic.” It’s not clear whether this means that the person goes into a situation with a plan ahead of time, or that once they get into a situation, they develop a plan for getting out. (Maybe both?)
 I caught a vice president using the word <i>planful</i> during a meeting, so I raised my hand and asked, “What does <i>planful</i> mean?” (Most people don’t have the nerve to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/26/10120297.aspx#10120605"> raise their hand during a meeting</a> and ask, “Um, what does that word mean?”)
 The vice president replied, “Actually, I don’t think it’s a real word. I think [name of a senior manager] made it up.”
 I followed up: “Well, in that case, why are we asked to evaluate you every year on whether your actions are planful? How can we answer a question that uses a made-up word nobody knows the definition of?”
 <b>Obligatory xpclient example</b>: “Was it a planful decision to introduce the auto-sorting problem?”</p>
<p> <b>Reminder</b>: Microspeak is not merely terms unique to Microsoft, but also terms used at Microsoft more often than in general. </p>
