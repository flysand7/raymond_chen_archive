<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Suited and booted</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>At Microsoft’s consulting divisions, customer visits are a part of the job. A shorthand has developed to describe how formally dressed you should be at the meeting with the customer.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Suited and booted</i>: Business suit including necktie. </li>
<li><i>Business casual</i>: Collared shirt and trousers (no jeans). </li>
<li><i>Microsoft casual</i>: Jeans and a t-shirt. </li>
</ul>
<p> (I leave it as an exercise to develop the comparable attire for women.) </p>
<p> Note: This Microspeak entry was submitted by a colleague from the UK, so it may be peculiar to the UK dialect of Microspeak. </p>
