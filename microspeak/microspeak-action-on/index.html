<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Action on</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I have been fortunate to have been spared exposure to this particular corner of Microspeak, but others have not been so lucky.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Have you <u>actioned on</u> this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/07/48304.aspx"> ask</a>? </p></blockquote>
<p> It’s not clear whether actioning on something means that you’ve started it or you’ve finished it. As a result, this is another case of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/26/8896167.aspx"> using jargon to impede communication</a>.
 The inventors of this particular form of Microspeak must be proud of themselves, for not only have they verbed a noun, they coupled it with an unnecessary preposition. But they aren’t content to stop there. It wasn’t long before the noun that got verbed got re-nouned!</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Here is our list of <u>action-ons</u>. </p></blockquote>
<p> The obfuscation is now complete. Nobody knows whether this is a list of things they want to do, a list of things for which management has given their approval, a list of things for which work has begun, or a list of things which have been completed! The only thing that is clear from that sentence is that there’s a <i>list</i> of some sort.</p>
<p> And I’m sure they’re working on obfuscating that, too. </p>
