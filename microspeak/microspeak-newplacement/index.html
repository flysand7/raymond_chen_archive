<p>When talking about why people buy computers, there are two broad categories, “replacement computers” (those which replace an older machine being retired) and “new placement computers” (those which do not).
 Now, sure, you have to call them <i>something</i>, but “new placements” sounds kind of markety. Then again, I felt the same way about using “seats” to mean “users” and see what that got me.</p>
