<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Proto-Microspeak: The goat rodeo</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Somebody at a meeting two years ago used the term “<a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/citations.php/citations/goat_rodeo_1/">goat rodeo</a>” to describe a completely confused situation. The term stuck with me as a really funny folksy analogy. It’s not official Microspeak, but who knows, it may someday gain currency. I certainly enjoy saying it.
 “Goat rodeo.”
 “Goat rodeo.”
 “Goat rodeo.”</p>
