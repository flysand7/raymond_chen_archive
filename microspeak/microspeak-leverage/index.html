<p>At Microsoft, <i>leverage</i> is not a term of physics whereby a force can be magnified by the application of mechanical advantage. It is also not a term of finance whereby the power of a small amount of money can be magnified by the assumption of debt. In fact, at Microsoft, the word <i>leverage</i> isn’t even a noun. It is a verb: <i>to leverage</i>, <i>leverages</i>, <i>leveraging</i>, <i>leveraged</i>, <i>has leveraged</i>. Oh, and it has nothing to do with magnification.

<p> At Microsoft, <i>to leverage</i> means <i>to take advantage of</i>, or in many cases, simply <i>to use</i>.
 Verbal use of the word <i>leverage</i> appears to be popular outside of Microsoft as well, such as this headline from eWeek: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/How-to-Leverage-IT-to-Speed-RandD-Innovation/"> <i>How to Leverage IT to Speed RandD Innovation</i></a>.</p>
<p> But can you do this: At Microsoft you can leverage people. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Alice, does Bob perform any component-Foo testing? Charles can be leveraged to actually execute tests if Donald can drive him with these asks. Let me know. </p></blockquote>
<p> That snippet was a whirlwind of Microspeak, with the passive form of the verb <i>to leverage</i>, plus <i>to drive</i> and the plural noun <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/07/48304.aspx"> <i>asks</i></a>. </p>
