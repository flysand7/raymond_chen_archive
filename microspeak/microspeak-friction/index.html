<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Friction</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In physics, <i>friction</i> is a force that resists motion. In Microspeak, <i>friction</i> is an obstacle which prevents somebody from doing something you want them to do. (The preferred verb phrase for getting over an obstacle is <i>overcoming friction</i>.)</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> There is friction in the system for X that is reduced when developing with Y. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Using X reduces friction of someone being able to do Y without having to Z. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Many companies have found that outsourcing activities can introduce unexpected complexity, add cost and <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/it_prose/archive/2005/04/20/403970.aspx"> friction</a> into the value chain, and require more senior management attention and deeper management skills than anticipated. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The goals of the Wiki include providing broader and more in-depth solutions content … from a wider variety of authors with less publishing <a href="http://microsoft.wikia.com/wiki/TechNet_Wiki"> friction</a> than less traditional mechanisms. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> While multi-tenancy and richer browser capabilities are valuable, I believe we have to start architecting multi-tenant solutions while incorporating the rich differentiation of new client platforms in disconnected and connected capabilities with the ability of ad-hoc collaborative communities forming around these services without centralized service <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/lcurtis/archive/2006/03/10/421792.aspx"> friction</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p> (That last one deserves some sort of award for impenetrability.)
 JD Meier kindly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jmeier/archive/2007/09/21/how-might-that-be-true.aspx"> defines the term</a> as it applies to communication:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It’s obvious in retrospect, but I found a distinction between low-friction communication and high-friction communication. By low-friction, I mean *person A* doesn’t have to work that hard for *person B* to get a point. </p></blockquote>
<p> As the term <i>friction</i> gained popularity, second-order jargon emerged, such as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/danbuche/archive/2011/08/29/friction-free-30-day-windows-azure-pass.aspx"> <i>friction-free</i></a> (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lab_management/archive/2010/02/09/dogfooding-visual-studio-lab-management-2010.aspx">another citation</a>).</p>
<p> (Remember that Microspeak covers not only terminology specific to Microsoft, but also business jargon that you need to know in order to “fit in.”) </p>
