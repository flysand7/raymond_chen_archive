<p>A <i>bar check</i> sounds like the sort of thing you receive at the end of a long evening of drinking, but that’s not what a bar check is.
 Among the things that happen at ship room meetings is reviewing each bug that has a proposed fix and deciding whether to accept or reject the fix.</p>
<p> Another thing that happens at ship room meetings is the <i>bar check</i>: The person <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/05/9043631.aspx"> representing</a> the bug describes the issue and what is known about it so far and asks for a preliminary assessment from the ship room as to whether this is the sort of bug they would approve if a fix were available, in other words, whether it meets the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2004/12/30/344424.aspx"> <i>bug bar</i></a>. If the answer is No, then there is no need to go to the effort of developing a fix for it right now, since you know it would get rejected anyway. </p>
