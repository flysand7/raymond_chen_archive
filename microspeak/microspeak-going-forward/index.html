<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Going forward</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> The jargon phrase <i>going forward</i> has largely replaced the more mundane equivalent <i>from now on</i>. It appears that <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10787_3-5873552.html"> I’m not the only person who is bothered by this phrase</a>. Sample usages: </p>
<ul>
<li>We discussed the membership and timeframe for support team meetings     going forward. </li>
<li>There will be change to the status reports going forward. </li>
<li>Going forward we will be doing this for every milestone. </li>
</ul>
<p> Notice that the phrase <i>going forward</i> usually adds little to the sentence. You can delete it from all of the sentences above and nobody would notice a difference. </p>
