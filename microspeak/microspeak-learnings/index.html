<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Learnings</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>If things you teach are <i>teachings</i>, then things you learn must be <i>learnings</i>, right? Good Microspeak citations for this word are hard to find since the word is rarely used in a sentence; it’s just a heading in a slide presentation. I found dozens of presentations that had a slide titled <i>Learnings from XYZ</i>, or, for those who want to sound really fancy, <i><u>Key</u> Learnings from XYZ</i>, but very few actual sentences. Here are two:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Alice will send an email to Bob with regards to any learnings from the XYZ program being incented to do ABC. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> What are our key learnings for this project? </p></blockquote>
<p> There’s that word <i>key</i> again, along with a surprise appearance of <i>incent</i>. </p>
<p> And that second citation barely counts since it’s really just a prose version of the slide heading! </p>
