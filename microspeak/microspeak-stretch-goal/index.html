<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Stretch goal</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Recall that Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but also for jargon that you need to know. </p>
<p>A project will set some goals, which are things it intends to accomplish. It may also set <i>stretch goals</i>, which are things it hopes to accomplish. If you fail to achieve a stretch goal, your project is still a success, but if you make it, your project is even more awesome. A stretch goal could be unrelated to an existing goal. </p>

<p>But more often, it takes the form of a higher level of achievement for an existing goal: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Goal: 40% of the programs will <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/16/10434390.aspx">land</a> actual <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/16/10558167.aspx">spend</a> within 10% of estimate. Stretch goal: 60%. </p></blockquote>
<p>Setting a stretch goal is tricky. You want to set it just at the edge of achievability. If you make it unrealistic, then nobody will take it seriously. </p>
<p>You can think of a stretch goal as an “extra credit” assignment. You won’t be penalized for missing it, but making it will earn you kudos. </p>
