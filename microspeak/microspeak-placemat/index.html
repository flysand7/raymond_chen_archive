<p>A placemat is a small cloth placed at a dining table which sits beneath a table setting. But at Microsoft, a placemat is something different.</p>
<p>A <i>placemat</i> is a document that lays out various important criteria or issues in a visually-pleasing manner. It gets its name from the placemat template that goes at the dining table with outlines for where the dinner plate goes, where the water glass goes, where the different forks go, and so on.</p>
<p>A strategic placemat might look like this:</p>

<p>In practice, there are a lot more boxes on the placemat, with additional columns for things like <i>Initiatives</i> and <i>Metrics for Success</i>, but I got tired of making up generic-sounding text.</p>
<p>Another kind of placemat is a lower-level feature placemat, with a box for each feature under development.</p>

<p>The placemat serves as an agenda for the <i>placemat review</i> meeting, where representatives from teams that have boxes on the placemat report on the status of their work. These placemat reviews tend to be convened by senior executives, so preparing for the placemat review is an important and somewhat stressful activity.</p>
