<p>Today’s Microspeak is the phrase <i>reason over</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>This API allows you to <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssdt/2013/06/24/announcing-sql-server-data-tools-june-2013/">reason over</a> the objects and relationships contained in the schema model generated by DACFx. </p></blockquote>

<p>To <i>reason over</i> something is to be able to make programmatic decisions about them, usually to produce a higher-level result. </p>
<p>For example, if you have a bunch of digital photos and you can obtain the date the photo was taken, then you can <i>reason over</i> the photos and do simple things like sort them chronologically, or more complex things like look for date clustering and attempt to infer events. If you also had location information, you could reason more confidently over the photos to identify photos taken at the same event. </p>
