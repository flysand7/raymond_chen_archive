<p>The metaphor here is that there is some sort of meter, like a speedometer or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter">VU meter</a>. Back in the old days, these meters were analog rather than digital, and they consisted of a calibrated arc with a needle that pointed at the current value. </p>
<p>To <i>move the needle</i> is to have a noticeable effect, presumably positive. </p>
<p>Here are some citations. </p>

<p>That second one wins the buzzword award for today. </p>
