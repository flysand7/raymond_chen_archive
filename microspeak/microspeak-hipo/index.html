<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Hipo</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>A friend of mind was asked out of the blue, “What does <i>hypo</i> mean?”
 She started to flash back to high school English class and Greek word roots.
 “I’ve started to hear it everywhere. Like <i>Everyone in that meeting is a hypo</i> or <i>We need to reach out to hypos</i>.”
 My friend realized that she had mis-heard the question. It was not about the Greek root <i>hypo</i> but rather the bizarro Microspeak word <i>hipo</i>, shorthand for <i>high-potential employee</i>.
 As I researched this term (which I had never encountered before), I found that it fell into that special category of Microspeak known as <i>if you have to ask, I’m not going to tell you</i>. Identifying and developing high-potential employees is one of the charter activities of the ExPo project. And if you look through the ExPo Web site, you’ll find that nowhere do they tell you what <i>HiPo</i> and <i>ExPo</i> stand for. “If you have to ask, I’m not going to tell you.”</p>
<p> My friend suggested that “ExPos are people who have a lot of potential and enjoy showing it off to others.” </p>
