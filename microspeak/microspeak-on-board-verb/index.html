<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: On-board (verb)</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>Here are a few citations.  On a list of activities:</p>
<blockquote class="m">
<ul>
<li>On-board a new team member. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> Presumably they mean <i>bring</i> on board. What makes this particularly interesting is that they didn’t convert a noun to a verb; they converted a <i>prepositional phrase</i> to a verb, demonstrating once again the malleability of the English language.
 Here’s a snippet from a blog post which seems to use the same meaning, but dispensing with the hyphen:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Over the past 4 weeks, we have been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ssds/archive/2008/05/02/8450444.aspx"> onboarding</a> customers slowly. </p></blockquote>
<p> On the other hand, there are usages whose intended meaning I can’t quite figure out. Some titles from documents I don’t have access to:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> How to On-Board Tools on the Extranet<br/> On-Boarding Kit </p></blockquote>
<p> And a subsection from an old document:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b>On-Board Schedule</b> </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" rules="all" style="border-collapse: collapse">

<th>Milestone</th>
<th>Target Date</th>

<p> ABC, DEF, and GHI were TLAs I did not understand. Frooble is a made-up word substituting for the actual word in the schedule. (And yes, “Go-Live” is a noun.)
 As a final example, there is somebody at Microsoft whose official job title is <i>Senior Onboarding Manager</i>.
 If you can figure out what <i>on-board</i> means, you’re smarter than me.</p>
