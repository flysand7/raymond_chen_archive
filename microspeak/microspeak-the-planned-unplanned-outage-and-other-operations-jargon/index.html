<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: The planned unplanned outage, and other operations jargon</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The Operations group at Microsoft manage the servers which keep the company running. And they have their own jargon which is puzzling to those of us who don’t spend all our days in a noisy server room.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Unplanned Unplanned Outage</i> </li>
<li><i>Planned Unplanned Outage</i> </li>
<li><i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i>.     This one even has its own TLA: IDT. </li>
</ul>
<p> From what I can gather, an <i>Unplanned Outage</i> would be better termed an <i>Unscheduled Outage</i>: We did not have it marked off on our calendar that the server would be unavailable at this time, but it ended up that way. These unscheduled outages fall into two categories: An <i>Unplanned Unplanned Outage</i> is an unscheduled outage that took place of its own volition. In other words, the server crashed or somebody accidentally kicked the power cable. On the other hand, the paradoxically-named <i>Planned Unplanned Outage</i> is an unscheduled outage that took place because the operations team took the server down out of schedule. For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/17/91178.aspx"> the server may have started thrashing</a>, and they think rebooting it will help.
 But the one that sounds really Microspeaky is <i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i>. Here’s a citation:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Date</b>: June 7, 2011 4:52 PM </p>
<p> …<br/> Due to the critical nature of this issue, the hotfix will be deployed in an Immediate Deployment Timeframe. All affected servers will be remediated on June 8. </p>
<p> <b>Start</b>: June 7, 2011 11:00PM<br/> <b>End</b>: June 8, 2011 12:00AM </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In other word, <i>Immediate Deployment Timeframe</i> means <i>as soon as possible</i>. Note, however that it doesn’t mean <i>now</i>, which is what I originally thought <i>immediate</i> meant until I looked at the start/end times and compared them to the message time. There must be some other TLA that means <i>now</i>, but what is faster than <i>immediate</i>?
