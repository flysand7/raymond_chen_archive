<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: The bug farm</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> In its most general sense, the term <i>bug farm</i> refers to something that is a rich source of bugs. </p>
<p> It is typically applied to code which is nearly unmaintainable. Code can arrive in this state through a variety of means. </p>
<ul>
<li>Poor initial design. </li>
<li>An initial design that has been pushed     far beyond its original specification     (resulting in features built on top of other features in weird ways). </li>
<li>Overwhelming compatibility constraints     such that the tiniest perturbation is     highly likely to cause some application somewhere to stop working. </li>
<li>Responsibility for the code residing in people whom we shall     euphemistically describe as     “failing to meet your personal standards of code quality.” </li>
</ul>
<p> The term is most often used as a cautionary term, calling attention to areas where there is high risk that code you’re about to write is going to result in a bug farm. </p>

<p> The term is quite popular at Microsoft (<b>pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: because Microsoft software is all one giant bug farm). Here are some citations just from <code>blogs.msdn.com</code>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Layout runs under disable processing. The reason we did that is because, well, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nickkramer/archive/2006/05/06/591252.aspx"> reentrant layout is a bug farm</a>. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> A lot of testers suddenly realized that case sensitivity is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/05/11/416293.aspx"> a veritable bug farm</a> on a project that thinks it is ready to go, but has not yet tried it. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> That type of implicit vs. explicit inference also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ansonh/archive/2004/03/13/89185.aspx"> turned out to be a bug farm</a>. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Did you forget to handle an entire set of test cases?  Is the features implementation overly complex and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larsberg/archive/2005/09/05/461182.aspx"> going to be a bug farm</a>? </p></blockquote>
