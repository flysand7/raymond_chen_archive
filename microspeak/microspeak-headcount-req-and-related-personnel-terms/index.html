<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Headcount, req, and related personnel terms</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>For some reason, there are a lot of Microspeak terms related to personnel. (Maybe you folks can tell me how common these terms are outside Microsoft.) </p>
<p>We start with a term that is not actually used much outside the personnel world: The <i>Position Control Number</i>, or PCN. The PCN represents a place where an employee could be hired. If somebody is actually hired for the position, then the PCN is <i>filled</i>; if not, then it is <i>unfilled</i>. </p>
<p>The term you are likely to hear outside of the personnel world is <i>headcount</i>. (Pronounced as the two words <i>head count</i>, accent on the first word.) This is a filled PCN, and it is often abbreviated to just <i>head</i>. </p>
<p>Another term you are likely to hear is a <i>req</i>, short for <i>requisition</i>, and pronounced like the word <i>wreck</i>. A req is a requisition to recruit; in other words, it is permission to look for somebody to fill a position. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>We have an open req to find somebody to frob the whatsit so it can futz the doodad. </p></blockquote>
<p>An <i>open req</i> is a req that has not yet been filled. This sounds redundant to me, because a req by definition is unfilled, isn’t it? </p>
<p>Yet another personnel term you may encounter is <i>backfill</i>. This refers to hiring someone to take over a position that has been vacated by somebody who left the team. You will sometimes hear the term used in a metaphorical context. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>Who is the backfill for Bob while he is on vacation? </p></blockquote>
<p>Bob has not actually left the team; the person merely wants to know who is covering Bob’s responsibilities while he is on vacation. </p>
<p>The last term I’m going to expose you to is the <i>ROP</i>, or <i>Recruiting Only Position</i>. A ROP is permission to interview someone for a position that doesn’t exist yet. You open a ROP with a particular person in mind, and once obtained, you have permission to interview them. You can think of a ROP as unapproved headcount, since if you decide to hire the person, you still have to find a PCN to put them in. And if you decide not to hire the person after you interviewed them, you close the ROP. </p>
<p>I have no idea how useful these terms are for people not in the personnel world, but I figured I’d write them down for my own benefit, so I have something to refer to when I run across them. </p>
