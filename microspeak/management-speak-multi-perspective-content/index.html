A colleague of mine visited an internal Web site for task ABC
and found that the site was no longer there.
Instead it was replaced with a simple message:
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
Designed with the user in mind you will now find
contextual ABC and DEF information served up in a secure format alongside
all GHI information.
Access to relevant multi-perspective content will enable
faster resolution for your GHI needs.
</p></blockquote>
