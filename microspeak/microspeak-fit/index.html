<p> In Microspeak, <i>fit</i> is a predicate noun which is never used on its own but always comes with a modifying adjective. For something to <i>be a good fit</i> is for something to be appropriate or suitable for a particular situation. The opposite of a <i>good fit</i> is not a <i>bad fit</i>, because that’s pejorative. Rather, something that is not a <i>good fit</i> is referred to as a <i>poor fit</i>. </p>
