<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Value proposition</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> This term is used outside Microsoft as well, but it still bothers me. The <i>value proposition</i> is the benefit that the end-user gets from your product, the thing that convinces them to buy it. What makes it even more annoying is when it is abbreviated to <i>value prop</i>. </p>
<p> Sample usage: “The main value proposition of this model is that it permits changes to be tracked without imposing a significant burden upon the editors.” </p>
