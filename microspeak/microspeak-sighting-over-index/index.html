<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak sighting: over-index</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>The other day, I heard the Microspeak term <i>over-index</i> used in the wild. It’s like birdwatching, but for words. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=581128170">a brief interview with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman</a>, they talked about the significance of having Amazon headquartered in your city. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>And Amazon can take some of the wealth of Seattle or Silicon Valley and bring it to the center of the country, and that can be really good. But I think people are <u>overindexed</u> on Amazon. There’s going to be Apple, and then there’s going to be Dropbox, and there’s going to be Intel.  </p></blockquote>
<p>The term here is being used in the Microspeak way: Given too much prominence in a discussion. He’s saying that people are focusing too much on Amazon and missing the other companies. </p>
