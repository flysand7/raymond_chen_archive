<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Sats</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/16/9756461.aspx"> introduced this Microspeak last year</a> as part of a general entry about management-speak, but I’m giving it its own entry because it deserves some attention on its own.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I just want to have creative control over how my audience can interact with me without resorting to complex hacking in a way that is easy to explain but ups our blogging audiences <u>sats</u> to a new level that may also stimulate a developer ecosytem that breeds quality innovation… </p></blockquote>
<p> Ignore the other management-speak; we’re looking at the weird four-letter word <i>sats</i>.
 <i>Sats</i> is short for <i>satisfaction metrics</i>. This falls under the overall <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/26/6865673.aspx"> obsession on measurement</a> at Microsoft. For many categories of employees (most notably the approximately 1000 employees eligible for the so-called <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2003896223_msftproxy22.html"> Shared Performance Stock Awards</a> program), compensation is heavily influenced by customer satisfaction metrics, known collectively as <i>CSAT</i>.
 Satisfaction metrics are so important that they have their own derived jargon.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Jargon</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VSAT</td>
<td>Very satisfied</td>
<td>Percentage of customers who report that they are     <i>very satisfied</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DSAT</td>
<td>Dissatisfied</td>
<td>Percentage of customers who report that they are     <i>somewhat dissatisfied</i>     or <i>very dissatisfied</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NSAT</td>
<td>Net satisfaction</td>
<td>NSAT = VSAT − DSAT</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> All of these jargon terms are pronounced by saying the first letter, followed by the word <i>sat</i>, so for example, <i>NSAT</i> is pronounced <i>N-sat</i>.
 You can see some of these metrics in use <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/mscom/archive/2006/08/02/view-from-the-top-running-the-business.aspx"> in a blog post from the Director of Operations at Microsoft.com</a>. Notice how he uses the terms <i>VSAT</i> and <i>DSAT</i> without bothering to explain what they mean. The meanings are so obvious to him that it doesn’t even occur to him that others might not know what they mean. (By comparison, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ksharkey/archive/2004/12/21/329299.aspx"> Kent Sharkey includes a definition when he uses the term</a>.)</p>
<p> And if you haven’t gotten enough of this jargon yet, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/partner/media/csat/"> there’s an entire training session online</a> on the subject of the Customer Satisfaction Index. If you’re impatient, click ahead to section 9. </p>
