<p>The more conventional definition of <i>represent</i> is along the lines of “to act as a proxy for”. An attorney represents his or her client in court. Your legislator represents you in the assembly. A token on a board represents your position in the game.</p>
<p> At Microsoft, the word <i>represent</i> takes on a stranger meaning. Here are some usages inspired by actual sentences: </p>
<ul>
<li>We need someone to represent this bug at the morning meeting. </li>
<li>Can somebody represent which OS versions are affected by this issue? </li>
</ul>
<p> In the first case, I’m guessing that the word <i>represent</i> means “to act as an advocate for” or possibly just “to serve as a source of information on”. </p>
<p> In the second case, it appears that the word <i>represent</i> just means “tell us in an official capacity”. </p>
<p> These new senses may be influenced by rap lyrics and what is genteelly referred to as <i>urban culture</i>. </p>
<p> If somebody actually knows what the word “represent” means at Microsoft, please add a comment. I asked the person who made the second statement for a definition, but what came back was merely the “act as a proxy for” definition, which clearly doesn’t make sense. (How can a person act as a proxy for a list of operating systems?) </p>
