<p>In mathematics, a <i>level set</i> is the set of points at which a function takes a particular value. This has nothing to do with the way the term is used at Microsoft.
 In fact, the way the term is used at Microsoft, I have no idea what it means. But here are citations. The first is from an upper-level executive:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Before we start the meeting, let me <i>level-set</i>. Here’s what we plan to accomplish today. </p></blockquote>
<p> The next is from a presentation to a large group on some investigative work a team undertook. After the presenter spent a few minutes discussing the background of the problem:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> That’s some <i>level-setting</i> on the hardware we had available for investigation. </p></blockquote>
<p> Here are some citations from presentation slide decks:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Agenda</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>… </li>
<li>Pre-work check and Level Set </li>
<li>… </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Initial Data gathering and Level Setting</b> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Teams share solution overviews, roadmaps and architecture views with each other to level set. </p></blockquote>
<p> (Notice that <i>level-set</i> is as a verb.)</p>
<p> From what I can gather, level-setting is some sort of blend of expectation-setting and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/27/1956484.aspx"> calibration</a>. </p>
