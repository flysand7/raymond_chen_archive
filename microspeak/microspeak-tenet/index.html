<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Tenet</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p>In standard English, a <i>tenet</i> is a fundamental belief held by a group of people. At Microsoft, the term <i>tenet</i> is used as a generalization of what we previously called <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/22/454487.aspx"> <i>taxes</i></a>: Things that everybody has to do in order to be a good software citizen.</p>
<p> While <i>taxes</i> are typically very low-level and specific, like supporting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/30/434209.aspx"> roaming user profiles</a> or <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/multiple-monitors"> multiple monitors</a>, <i>tenets</i> are broader concepts like <i>reliability</i> or <i>compatibility</i> or <i>API design and documentation</i>. </p>
<p> The word doesn’t escape the halls of Microsoft very often. Most of the citations I have are internal, but here’s a case where Jon DeVaan let it slip into a keynote address: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> And together we’ve improved reliability on Vista huge amount. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/exec/ssinofsky/11-05winhec08.aspx"> And when you look at the compatibility tenet</a> that we have for Windows 7, all of this work translates immediately to the reliability of Windows 7 on day one. </p></blockquote>
<p> Occasionally, somebody will confuse the word <i>tenet</i> with the superficially-similar <i>tenant</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We still have many bugs marked as <i>High tenant impact</i>. </p></blockquote>
<p> Remember: </p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/04/15/10410966.aspx">tenant</a></i>: Somebody who is renting from you. </li>
<li><i>tenet</i>: An important principle or belief. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Bad pun alert</b>: I guess a bug could be high tenant impact if it’s a bedbug or lice. </p>
