<h1 class="entry-title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">Microspeak: Cadence</h1>  <!-- .entry-meta -->

<p> Originally, the term <i>cadence</i> meant <i>the rate at which a regular event recurs</i>, possibly with variations, but with an overall cycle that repeats. For example, the cadence for team meetings might be “Every Monday, with a longer meeting on the last meeting of each month.” </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Project X is on a six-month release cadence, whereas Project Y takes two to three years between releases. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> <b>Q</b>: What was the cadence of email requests you sent out to drive contributions? </p>
<p> <b>A</b>: We started with an announcement in September, with two follow-up messages in the next month. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In what I suspect is a case of <i>I want to use this cool word other people are using, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/26/8896167.aspx"> even though I don’t know exactly what it means</a></i>, the term has been applied more broadly to mean <i>schedule</i> or <i>timeline</i>, even for nonrecurring events. Sample usage: “What is our cadence for making this available outside the United States?” </p>
